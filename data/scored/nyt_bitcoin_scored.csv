0,Spend Some Time With the Winklevii,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/books/review/ben-mezrich-bitcoin-billionaires.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-05-21,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"BITCOIN BILLIONAIRESA True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and RedemptionBy Ben Mezrich At the end of 2017, Bitcoin mania was in full swing. Prices of the digital currency had reached a record high of about $20,000 a pop. Wall Street banks were rushing to get in on the frenzy. Egged on by hyperbolic cheerleaders, small-time investors socked their savings in the so-called cryptocurrency. And then, just as you would expect of an asset whose value had increased exponentially in the blink of an eye, the bubble burst. The price of Bitcoins fell by about 80 percent (though it has rebounded some lately). Mainstream financial institutions scurried away, jittery about the currency’s susceptibility to manipulation and money laundering. Many individuals who put their faith in the digital currency saw their fortunes erased. In “Bitcoin Billionaires,” Ben Mezrich chronicles the dizzying rise of the digital currency, through the eyes of two of its biggest boosters: the celebrity twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. He doesn’t get around to detailing the nausea-inducing fall. The Winklevoss brothers are best known for their public brawl with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. They all attended Harvard together, and the twins later claimed in a lawsuit that Zuckerberg stole their idea for his social network. That story is well known thanks in part to Mezrich’s previous book, “The Accidental Billionaires.” (It was adapted by Aaron Sorkin into the award-winning film “The Social Network.”) “Bitcoin Billionaires” is essentially a sequel to Mezrich’s breezy, best-selling Facebook book. It picks up with the Winklevoss brothers prying a lucrative settlement — cash and Facebook shares that will be worth more than $200 million — out of Zuckerberg. They soon plow a chunk of that into the Bitcoin circus, where they encounter shameless hucksters, hapless computer geeks and shadowy criminals. In “The Accidental Billionaires,” the identical twins — hulking, 6-foot-5-inch Olympic rowers — came across as well-intentioned overachievers who fall victim to the ruthless, brilliant Zuckerberg. In “Bitcoin Billionaires,” Mezrich goes in a slightly different direction, caricaturing the Winklevii — as the brothers are collectively nicknamed — as grumpy geniuses and sympathetic underdogs. We are supposed to feel their pain as they are ostracized from Facebook-dominated Silicon Valley and as they struggle to find worthwhile companies in which to invest their nine-figure windfalls. Of course, it’s hard to muster much pity for two privileged young men — raised in Greenwich, Conn., their father a wealthy consultant — who pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars for, in essence, spending a few months in college hatching and then failing to execute on a half-baked internet idea. In any case, the Winklevii soon confront a series of challenges. The first is what to do with their newfound fortunes. The twins know they are destined to create important things, but they’re initially not sure what those things should be. As Mezrich explains: “Tyler and Cameron were builders. As kids they built LEGOs. As teenagers — they built webpages.” A couple of paragraphs later, Mezrich adds, “Tyler and Cameron didn’t believe they were on the earth to exist; they were here to create, to build.” After months of fruitless searching for things to build, the dejected twins head to Ibiza for a break — the first “real vacation in their entire lives,” Mezrich notes, implausibly. They mope to a dance party, and that is where they bump into a Brooklyn entrepreneur who is touting Bitcoin as the Next Big Thing. The twins get excited, do some research, talk to Dad, and invest in an online company that makes it easier for people to acquire the digital currency. Then they use some of their Facebook winnings to buy about 1 percent of the world’s total outstanding Bitcoins. Their timing is great — Bitcoin is dirt cheap in 2013 — and as its value rockets higher, the Winklevoss brothers get richer and richer. They go to really great parties. And some of their Silicon Valley haters eventually embrace them, old wounds salved by new wealth. Mezrich treats the brothers’ Bitcoin binge as something profound, as if they are the visionaries who created the cryptocurrency rather than the rich gamblers who wagered on it. He hails their subsequent Bitcoin proselytizing as crucial to the mainstreaming of a once-obscure currency, without acknowledging that their pitch might be self-serving, intended to drive up the price of their prized asset. Mezrich is a talented storyteller, and portions of “Bitcoin Billionaires” offer memorable glimpses inside the messy world of a start-up currency. As the value of their Bitcoin hoard soars, for example, the twins go to elaborate (paranoid?) lengths to safeguard it, locking scraps of printed computer code in safe deposit boxes in random banks all over the country. And we encounter a genuine underdog — one who is much more textured than the worshipfully portrayed Winklevii — in the twins’ business partner, Charlie Shrem. Raised in a Syrian Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, Shrem is propelled by his burning ambition to escape his parents’ basement. He might be a genius, and he is certainly loyal, but he is also undisciplined, gets carried away with his fledgling fame and demonstrates remarkably poor judgment in his fellow humans. Even here, though, Mezrich’s tale is hampered by his reliance on the Winklevoss brothers as his main sources. (Mezrich writes in an author’s note that the book is based on “hundreds of sources,” but the twins’ very large fingerprints are basically the only ones visible.) The Winklevii apparently came to loathe Shrem, and the story jolts back and forth between Mezrich’s attempts to capture the character’s true essence and uncritical parroting of the twins’ harsh judgments. Throughout, the narrative is polluted by clichés — “the battle for Bitcoin had just begun,” we’re told — and stilted attempts at recreating dialogue. At one point, a recent Stanford grad simply named “Jake” tells the Winklevoss brothers — then still radioactive from their war with the mighty Zuckerberg — that he won’t accept their tainted money in his virtual-reality start-up. “It might be optics, but optics are important in a land of dreamers,” Jake lectures. “Your dollars might be green, but they’re marked.” Come on. And then there is Mezrich’s jarring disclosure at the outset that some details and settings described in the book are “imagined.” It is hard to overcome the impression that large swaths of the book fall into that fictional zone. That includes a bizarre final scene, inside Mark Zuckerberg’s office. “The Accidental Billionaires” also suffered from Mezrich’s flippant writing and thin sourcing. But that book worked because its topic — the creation of a social network that fundamentally changed the world, for better and for worse — was freighted with importance. That isn’t the case in “Bitcoin Billionaires.” The supposedly revolutionary powers of digital currencies have yet to be unleashed. And while Bitcoin’s rise seemed to make its enduring relevance self-evident, Mezrich doesn’t bother with the consequences of its subsequent plunge — including the inconvenient fact that the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin fortunes no longer appear to be measured in billions.",0.10135800000000002,0.1073623325087611
1,"After the Bust, Are Bitcoins More Like Tulip Mania or the Internet?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/technology/bitcoin-tulip-mania-internet.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-04-23,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — When you talk to tech industry insiders about where Bitcoin is heading, two vastly different comparisons are inevitable: the tulip bulb and the internet. Bitcoin’s critics say the digital tokens are like the tulip bulbs of 17th-century Holland. They generated a wild, speculative rush that quickly disappeared, leaving behind nothing but pretty flowers and wrecked bank accounts. Bitcoin believers, on the other hand, want us to think about cryptocurrencies as if they were the internet: a broad technology category that took some time to reach its potential, even though expectations got ahead of reality in the early years. If that’s true, last year’s crash in Bitcoin prices was like the dot-com bust; a temporary setback before the big ideas come to fruition. After following Bitcoin for several years, I think neither of these comparisons quite works. Bitcoin is neither an irredeemable flop nor an economic miracle. So what is it? We are still a few years from any sort of clarity about where this technology will fit in the world. If we want to imagine where it might be going, we need to look beneath the gyrating price to understand how it is being used today and who is using it. At the most basic level, Bitcoin has introduced a new way to hold and send around value online. Anyone can open a Bitcoin wallet and receive money from a friend or a stranger. The system works without any central authority, thanks to a network of computers that is not unlike the network of computers supporting the internet. Even after last year’s bust, Bitcoin users are generally sending somewhere between $400 million and $800 million worth of Bitcoin across the network every day, according to data from the blockchain, the public ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. That daily volume is less than half the daily average of the payment service PayPal. But it is much more activity than the network handled before the price spiked in 2017. As the proponents of the tulip bulb version of Bitcoin will tell you, most of the transactions today are speculative: people buying and selling Bitcoin in the hope that it will be worth more in the future. A more generous viewpoint would compare Bitcoin to gold, a scarce commodity that goes up and down in value and provides an alternative to national currencies. Speculative transactions accounted for roughly 60 to 80 percent of all transactions on the blockchain, according to Chainalysis, a start-up that does analysis of the blockchain for big companies and governments. Most of those transactions are Bitcoins moving between cryptocurrency exchanges around the world. There is still quite a bit of mystery about what accounts for the other 20 to 40 percent of the transactions. No one can force Bitcoin users to register their identity, so Chainalysis and other firms are in the dark about many transactions. But they have identified some useful chunks. When Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, it was described as a new way to make payments online, without the fees that credit card companies charge. Chainalysis estimates that last year, companies handling Bitcoin payments accounted for 0.3 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, or $2.4 billion. This is a healthy dose of apparently legal commerce, but it was not a good sign for Bitcoin that it was shrinking for most of last year when the price of Bitcoin was going down, according to Chainalysis data. Many if not most Bitcoin advocates I’ve encountered will admit it doesn’t offer much of an improvement over traditional electronic methods of payment. In several ways, it’s worse. Paying with Bitcoin requires you to become a speculator on its volatile price for the time you are holding on to tokens and waiting to pay. The payment data leads to the question of where this technology might gain momentum, beyond speculation. The most compelling use that Bitcoin fanatics talk about is its value to people in repressive countries that have currencies that are even more volatile than Bitcoin. In Venezuela, for example, Bitcoin can offer a way to move savings out of the inflating bolívar. Because of the open nature of Bitcoin, Venezuelans can buy it without the government stopping them. There are stories of Venezuelans using Bitcoin to rescue their savings. Venezuelans bought over $230 million in Bitcoin last year on the most popular platform for sales, LocalBitcoins, according to the data analyst Matt Ahlborg. Those purchases were growing even as the price of Bitcoin was falling. But it caught on with only a tiny sliver of Venezuelans. And there are reasons to wonder how many of these transactions were really just corrupt government officials or wealthy Venezuelans who had other means of getting their money out of the country. People who have traveled to Venezuela have told me that most ordinary people they spoke to would prefer to have their money in dollars instead of Bitcoin. The bigger problem facing Bitcoin is that the practical and legal uses have struggled to outpace illegal or clearly unethical activity. The list of ways that Bitcoin has proved useful to criminals keeps growing, from the ransom payments on locked-up computer files — or even hostages — to illegal drug sales. Many of these misdeeds are hard to quantify, but Chainalysis has managed to put numbers on Bitcoins used to buy drugs on the so-called dark net. Chainalysis numbers show that drug purchases rose last year, even when the price of Bitcoin was falling. The total dark net transactions in 2018, around $620 million, were more than twice the amount that Venezuelans bought on LocalBitcoins. Bitcoin fans will tell you that this is a drop in the bucket compared with how much the dollar is used to buy drugs. But all the data I’ve seen suggests that drug purchases account for a much larger proportion of the Bitcoin economy than their proportion of the dollar economy. And Bitcoin has enabled new kinds of deadly drug traffic, like the synthetic opioids that have flowed from China to small towns in the United States. Illegal activity, and especially pornography, played an important role in the early internet, but nothing like what we’ve seen from Bitcoin in its early days. Bitcoin is accessible to anyone — not so different from the internet. The problem is that, other than speculation, none of its legitimate uses have taken hold at anything like the pace of the illegal activity. That the technology hasn’t gained traction with ordinary people does not mean it won’t someday. There are still plenty of areas where, smart entrepreneurs think, the open nature of cryptocurrencies could be useful. Many venture capitalists have made bets on Ethereum and EOS, alternative cryptocurrency networks that can be programmed for more sophisticated applications, like financial contracts, than Bitcoin’s software allows. Programmers have already built thousands of so-called decentralized applications, or Dapps, that use the EOS and Ethereum tokens. Many of them can be used today. These Dapps can move money around and record ownership of digital goods, like items in video games, without a central company keeping the records. But a majority of these Dapps still focus on legal gray zones, like gambling. The most prominent use of Ethereum so far has been by companies, many of them scams and frauds, that wanted to raise money without complying with securities regulations, through so-called initial coin offerings. I have seen little indication that any of the more legitimate uses have worked easily enough to have any appeal beyond cryptocurrency fanatics. Perhaps the biggest thing that cryptocurrencies have going for them is that serious people still want to fix the flaws. The value of digital tokens — however volatile they may be — has created incentives for people to work on them. The latest big cryptocurrency player is Facebook, which is said to be working on its own digital tokens. So are several other big messaging companies. I can’t predict the future of cybercurrencies any more than the holdout dreamers and the naysayers. But with the serious money still finding its way into the market, it is far too early to write the whole thing off.",0.11372812500000001,0.09038407700517076
2,Cryptocurrency Was Their Way Out of South Korea’s Lowest Rungs. They’re Still Trying.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/business/south-korea-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-02-10,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Ki-won is keeping a secret from his parents. It isn’t just that he has bought and sold an immense number of digital coins. Mr. Kim, who is 27 and lives with his parents, once made so much money trading cryptocurrencies that he was spending $1,000 a month on whatever he wanted. He quit his job. He borrowed to buy more. He planned to buy a house. Today he sits slumped over, at times hiding his eyes behind his hair. Which brings us back to Mr. Kim’s secret: He has lost a lot of money, perhaps tens of thousands of dollars. “I don’t think it’s fair that people call it gambling,” he said of his cryptocurrency obsession. “But there are elements of truth here and there.” A generation of young South Koreans like Mr. Kim, looking for a way out of their dead-end prospects, has helped turn the country into a capital of the wild world of cryptocurrencies. Now that the market has virtually collapsed, many people young and old are mired in debt and losses. Still, many young South Koreans continue to see digital money as a way to break out.  South Korea remains the third-largest market for virtual currency, behind the United States and Japan. A total of $6.8 billion in cryptocurrencies changed hands in January, according to the data provider Messari. South Korea is a major trading hub for Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, as well as a wide variety of other virtual currencies that exist without the backing of any country’s central bank.  Cryptocurrencies have become a cultural phenomenon in the country.  Coffee shops print their own digital coins. A national television network made a game show called “Block Battle,” in which contestants — one named “Kimchi Powered” — battled to build a company based on cryptotechnology.  On a recent evening in Seoul, a group of women and men in their 60s and 70s gathered at an event lit by strobe lights for the start of a new digital coin. But it was millennials like Mr. Kim who led the charge. Many call themselves “dirt spoons,” a reference in South Korea to economic and social status, with gold and silver spoons being the best off and dirt spoons being the worst.  Cryptocurrencies seemed to be a way to disrupt that social order.  “There is no true opportunity in South Korea for the average young person,” said Kim Han-gyeol, 23, who graduated from a vocational school and became a part-time software developer for an e-book company.  She lives with her parents and works part time at Dunkin’ Donuts, studying English online at night. At first, she made a lot of money investing in cryptocurrencies. She used a few thousand dollars she made to buy nice clothes for herself and her mother, and dreamed of starting a coffee shop with her loot. Then, she lost nearly all of it.  “I felt a sense of shame when I lost money on my Bitcoin investments, not once but twice because of my greed to make a fortune in one go,” she said. Even still, she added, she’ll stick to digital coins. “There is nowhere else to go to recover my losses anyway,” she said. Being young in South Korea can be defeating and stifling. To succeed is to get either a government position or a job at one of a small but powerful group of family-owned conglomerates that control most of the products Koreans use. This requires getting into one of a handful of exclusive universities, a feat that has become so difficult that many young people delay applying for several years. Income inequality is among the worst in Asia. Youth unemployment is 10.5 percent and has hovered near that figure for the past five years even as overall unemployment is 3.4 percent.  Young Koreans are called the “sampo generation,” a portmanteau referring to the three things they have given up on: courtship, marriage and family. Adding to their sense of disillusionment is a string of political scandals, including one that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, that exposed the deeply entrenched ties between South Korea’s powerful conglomerates and politicians. When cryptocurrency came along, it set off discussions in chat rooms, weekly hangouts and even intellectual salons created just for digital coins: Could this new system uproot South Korea’s rigid social order? Buying digital coins was a lot easier than buying stocks or getting a loan to start a business. Kim Ki-won needed to invest only a small amount in the early days. “It was an opportunity for me to make big money,” he said, his eyes wide with excitement even now thinking about the prospect. For Remy Kim, a 29-year-old who is host to several cryptocurrency channels on the social media app Telegram, digital money could mean nothing short of revolution. Online he goes by “Les Mis,” after “Les Misérables,” the Victor Hugo tale of the poor rising up in revolution. Mr. Kim writes about Cryptopia, a future where everyone is equal and the social constructs that money creates don’t exist.  “Crypto played a role in shifting wealth from one group in society to another,” he said. “It has affected Korean society tremendously.”  Mr. Kim discovered cryptocurrencies after his computer was hacked by a person who demanded Bitcoin in ransom. In the end, he paid the hacker 1.2 Bitcoins — which at the time was worth nearly $800.  Soon he was buying digital coins for himself, riding a Bitcoin bubble that peaked at more than $19,000 for a single Bitcoin. He made enough to buy himself a half-million-dollar navy blue Rolls-Royce. As far as he knows, “I’m the youngest person in Korea with a Rolls-Royce,” he said.  Mr. Kim said he had since lost much of what he made, but he doesn’t like to dwell on this. (He still has the Rolls.) Last year, South Korea’s government mulled shutting down virtual currency exchanges where investors buy and sell, saying that it was starting to look a lot like gambling.  At the time, some exchanges were processing transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But the news caused an outcry, and the government merely barred cryptocurrency investors from opening new anonymous accounts linked to banks in an attempt to crack down on money laundering. Even some former cryptocurrency evangelists warn that the best days are over. They include Kimchi Powered, the contestant on the “Block Battle” television show.  Kimchi Powered, whose real name is Jung Ki-young, made it all the way to the show’s finals, in part by entertaining the judges with silly costumes. On the night of the final round, Mr. Jung, 36, wore a shimmering suit jacket.  He still invests in cryptocurrencies, but warns others that there aren’t as many opportunities to make money as before. “Many people are very depressed these days because the price of Bitcoin has dropped,” he said in an interview. “It was my intention to give people a reason to laugh rather than trying to win the competition.”  Falling prices aren’t the only reason South Koreans can’t make money as they did before.  Big companies increasingly overshadow small investors. Hyundai, a major conglomerate, created a blockchain platform called HDAC and advertised the technology at the World Cup. A unit of Lotte, a conglomerate that became embroiled in a corruption scandal in 2017, has worked with blockchain start-ups. A number of South Koreans have also been hit by scams.  “Koreans lack knowledge about finance,” said Remy Kim, the investor who goes by Les Mis and who gives tips and information on how cryptocurrencies work. “They are stingy at the store, but then they poured everything into cryptocurrencies.” Still, many dirt spoons hold on to the hope that cryptocurrencies will turn back around.  Kim Ki-won said he would tell his parents about his cryptocurrency obsession soon. But first, he wants to make enough to start a business. He is sure that the market will turn around. “I have nothing to lose,” he said. “I always wanted to be rich.”",0.0012278481012658277,0.051264616478224063
3,South Korea Clamps Down on Bitcoin Trading Amid Market Frenzy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/south-korea-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-28T11:42:51+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"South Korea will require people who trade Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to do so under their real names, the country’s government said on Thursday, as part of efforts to curb speculation. Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been on a gravity-defying bull run over the past few months. The price of a Bitcoin started the year at around $1,000 and topped $19,000 earlier this month, causing swarms of ordinary savers around the world to get in on what remains a largely unregulated — and highly volatile — investment. Nowhere, though, has the frenzy over virtual currencies been as fevered, or as sudden, as in South Korea. Until recently, markets for Bitcoin and its competitors barely existed in the country. But a spurt of interest has swept up ordinary people from students to retirees. Trading has become so popular that some South Korean exchanges have set up physical storefronts where the uninitiated can learn more and buy in. Requiring that trading take place using real names brings virtual currencies like Bitcoin more in line with other financial products in South Korea. Although Bitcoin has shed some of its associations with payment for illegal activity, the real-name policy set out on Thursday could also make it easier for the South Korean government to track transactions and to tax capital gains from virtual-currency investments. The price of Bitcoin tumbled after the announcement. “Cryptocurrency speculation has been irrationally overheated in Korea,” the government said in a statement, while adding that officials would discuss further potential moves to stem speculative trading, such as shutting down some virtual currency exchanges. “The government can’t let this abnormal situation of speculation go on any longer.” The authorities have taken other steps to rein in the market. In September, South Korea’s financial regulator banned initial coin offerings, a way for start-ups and online projects to raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies. Government officials, including the prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, have made no secret of their concerns about investor frenzy. “This can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,” Mr. Lee said after a cabinet meeting in November. Kim Jin-hwa, who heads an industry association for businesses working with virtual currencies and other applications of blockchain technology in South Korea, said most of the country’s virtual currency exchanges could already verify customers’ identities via their cellphones. The exchanges, Mr. Kim said, had also worked with banks to develop new measures for ensuring transparency. The government is more interested in sending a warning to investors about the potentially overheated market, said S. G. Lee, chairman of the Korea Fintech Industry Association. Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the prime minister, said he believed that the government had been hoping to cool the speculative fervor merely by discussing tighter regulation — and not by actually implementing too many rules. Officials worry, Mr. Lee said, that more regulation would give virtual currencies greater legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and increase trading activity. “It’s really tricky for the government,” Mr. Lee said. “They are worried about giving a wrong perception to the people.”",0.017668965517241376,0.01585504055331641
4,Bitcoin Plummets More Than 30 Percent in Less Than a Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/business/bitcoin-plunges-more-than-25-percent-in-24-hours.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-22T15:12:45+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"You can’t exactly say that Bitcoin was burning a hole in anyone’s pocket, but the virtual currency burned a hole in quite a few hearts on Friday when it plunged 30 percent in less than 24 hours after defying gravity for the past few months. Many skeptics of the virtual currency, which operates with no government or company in charge, have predicted that it was in bubble territory and due for a collapse. Still, the drop to around $12,000 a Bitcoin from around $17,500 was enough to set off a panic among buyers, even while stock market investors remained calm and much of the world, unaware that Bitcoin exists, was oblivious to the uproar. On Reddit, the online forum visited by many Bitcoin followers, people posted phone numbers for suicide hotlines for bereft investors. A popular service that sells Bitcoin to many individual investors went down, overwhelmed by orders. “If someone is depressed by the sudden drop in price, remember that many of us are going through the same thing,” read one post on Reddit, which got more than 400 responses. “Please don’t think nothing crazy. You can use my thread to vent.” Bitcoins can be used to pay for things online, but they have mostly been treated as an investment because there is a cap of 21 million on the number of Bitcoin that will ever be released. The records of all Bitcoins are maintained by a network of computers around the world. The creator of Bitcoin, someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, has never been tracked down, though many have tried. For a time, Bitcoin was known as the currency of drug dealers and other bad actors skulking on the internet. In recent months, hedge funds and ordinary investors around the world have piled into Bitcoin, lured by the promise of a borderless digital investment with no one in charge. That has pushed the price of Bitcoin up from $1,000 at the beginning of the year to more than $19,000 this week, with its run-up raising comparisons to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1600s and the late 1990s dot-com boom. Yet when the virtual currency, which is highly volatile, experienced its fall late Thursday and early Friday, many of its new fans were unprepared. The downturn hit not just Bitcoin, but almost every other virtual currency that has soared over the last year. Ethereum, and lesser-known tokens like EOS and ZCash, fell even more sharply than Bitcoin. Vadim Semenov, 24, a programmer in New York, had maxed out the credit lines on two credit cards to buy $35,000 of Bitcoin on Monday, when the currency’s price was briefly above $19,000. Bitcoin’s dive left him feeling unmoored on Friday morning. “I panicked a lot, and was checking everything to find news about why it is dropping,” he said. By late Friday morning, he had decided to sit tight. And by Friday afternoon, the virtual currency markets had regained some of their composure, leaving the price of Bitcoin down from earlier in the week — but still 1,200 percent higher than where it began the year. Although Bitcoin has left behind some of its associations as a black market currency, the infrastructure surrounding the virtual currency is still largely unregulated and untested. The flood of new users into the virtual currency in recent weeks has put stress on that loose system. The trading platform Coinbase, a San Francisco company that has become the primary place where ordinary Americans have purchased Bitcoin — and is one of the most highly regulated companies in the industry — has gone down at several points under the weight of so many new investors. That happened again on Friday when Bitcoin’s price was plunging, leading to agony for many people who wanted to sell along with the rest of the crowd. For people who have been loudly saying that Bitcoin is a bubble or even a fraud of some sort, Friday’s jolt was a vindication. William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts state securities regulator who has cautioned investors about Bitcoin in the past, put out another warning on Friday. “Bitcoin is just the latest in a history of speculative bubbles that most often burst, leaving the average investors with a worthless product,” he said. “Recent developments indicate that this so-called currency is not a secure investment.” The volatility appeared to cause some second thoughts for even sophisticated investors. Michael Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs partner, said a few months ago that he was starting a $500 million virtual currency hedge fund and expected the price of a Bitcoin to hit $40,000. On Friday, he told Bloomberg that he had called off the plans for the fund because he did not want to deal with the ""schizophrenic emotional side of it.” He also said he thought Bitcoin could fall as low as $8,000, at least in the short term. This is not the first time that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been through a boom-and-bust cycle. In 2013, Bitcoin’s price rose first to above $200 before crashing. Later that year, an investing mania in China drove the price to another high above $1,200, followed by yet another plunge. Anyone who got in during those earlier run-ups is still easily in the money. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, had $11 million of Bitcoin in 2013 and watched it rise to $1.3 billion earlier this week. Even with Friday’s declines, those holdings are still worth more than $1 billion. Longtime investors said that Friday’s drama is probably a healthy reminder that Bitcoin is still an investment where people should only have money that they are willing to lose. “It’s a healthy speed bump that will remind people of the newness of the space, and inherent volatility that goes with it,” said Chris Burniske, author of the book “Cryptoassets,” which is about virtual currencies. Mr. Semenov, who maxed out his credit cards to buy Bitcoin this week, first got into Bitcoin in 2014 when it was at $700 and sold when it dropped to $300 that year. Watching Bitcoin rise since then is what convinced him not to sell on Friday. “I already once made a mistake of dumping everything,” he said. “This year definitely showed that adoption is not going to slow down.”",-0.043768888888888885,0.07387382884605108

But more important, I’m going to experience five days of nonstop fajitas, queso and barbecue, because all I do when I go home for the holidays is eat like an Olympic weight lifter. Related: I hope Santa brings me an angioplasty this year. But enough about seasonal gluttony, let’s talk tech! Farhad: So there was more drama with cryptocurrencies this week, big surprise. First, there were the usual price swings — the price of Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 this week before crashing to around $15,000, and now it’s somewhere in the middle. Mike: And by the time people receive this newsletter, it’ll probably be nowhere near there. Farhad: Right. But people who were introduced to cryptocurrencies through Bitcoin are now learning about the wild variety of other kinds of crypto tokens online. And so the biggest news this week wasn’t with Bitcoin but a variant called Bitcoin Cash — an alternative currency that was created a few months ago. This week, Coinbase, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, added Bitcoin Cash to its service. And that’s when things went crazy. The price of Bitcoin Cash surged to three times its original price. Coinbase had to halt trading, cancel some trades, and now it’s in the process of investigating what happened — in particular, to look for evidence of insider trading. You’ve been tweeting about this all day, so I know you have some thoughts. Mike: I have to admit, I’ve kind of gone cuckoo for cryptocurrency. It’s just so weird, lawless and interesting! If you’d have told 14-year-old me that I’d be into esoteric new forms of digital finance in my 30s, I’d have called both you and my future self a huge nerd. And a time traveler, I guess. So, a few things. First, the Coinbase thing is interesting because the evidence of the company accepting Cash appeared a few days before on Reddit, which gave some folks a heads up and the decision to invest in Cash ahead of the debut. Why does that matter? Glad you asked! Well, as I noted last week, any currency that Coinbase decides to accept on its platform typically immediately goes up in price, because it’s one of the most popular exchanges and growing quickly among American newcomers. And, as we saw last night, that’s exactly what happened. Anyone who had the luck, foresight and inside information to trade on that detail probably made a lot of money. But is insider trading illegal? If we’re talking about the securities world of exchanges like the Nasdaq and N.Y.S.E., then yes, it is very much illegal. Don’t do it. But as many of our friends on Twitter pointed out to me, it’s not illegal to trade commodities on inside information, though perhaps it is unethical! And right now, we’re not even fully sure whether Bitcoin is classified as a security or a commodity. What a world. Farhad: What’s striking to me about this space is how lawless and reckless it is. There’s a feeling like in the 1990s dot-com era — that anyone can make it rich, that it’s a brand new space and anything is possible. It’ll probably end up in tears for a lot of people, but there’s also undeniable excitement. Mike: I 100 percent agree. What’s fascinating are the corollaries in other areas of tech, like with Uber, for instance. Often the argument is, “What we’re doing is not illegal because a framework of laws addressing what we do doesn’t even exist.” Though to be honest, I’m not sure that argument will always hold up in court. Farhad: Speaking of Uber, I had expected that Uber’s future would brighten after they brought on a new chief executive, but things seem as grim as ever for the company. Europe’s highest court just ruled that Uber is in fact a transportation business and not a tech platform that simply connects riders and drivers. This is obvious to anyone who uses it — everyone thinks of Uber as a taxi — but the ruling has a practical effect: it means that Uber cannot use nonprofessional drivers and has to comply with other taxi rules across Europe. And it could affect how other “gig economy” companies — firms that, like Uber, rely on contractors to service other customers — operate. Is this a big deal for Uber? Mike: Like any wonderfully nuanced beat reporter, I’ll say “yes and no.” Yes, it’s a big deal insofar as it limits a certain type of growth for Uber in Europe, namely the company’s peer-to-peer model, UberX. That basically lets anyone with a working car sign up for Uber, flooding the market with an enormous supply of cars and growing the business immensely. It’s been a boon for Uber in the United States, and the company has hoped to spread that abroad as well. That said, some of Uber’s most successful markets are those in which the company is tightly regulated and treated essentially like a taxi service. In New York, for example, Uber is required to only use drivers who are registered with the Taxi and Limousine Commission — that is, cab and private drivers — unlike most of the other cities in the United States. And yet, New York is still a huge market for Uber, where they do quite a bit of business. So does it cripple the business? No, and there are other cities Uber can try to push its UberX option. But it is a bit of a rain on Uber’s money parade. What’s worse for Uber, in my mind, was that letter from a former Uber employee detailing a history of espionage and corporate counterintelligence inside of Uber for years. It’s tough to come back from being seen like your ride-hailing company is full of Jason Bourne wannabes. Although to be fair, Jason Bourne is pretty cool. Do you think I could be like him some day? Farhad: Ha-ha, no. Anyway, it’s a short week. The holidays are upon us. Can we just stop talking now? Mike: Yeah, I can hear the Tex-Mex calling my name. Peace! Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art. Mike Isaac covers Facebook, Uber and Twitter. You can follow them on Twitter at @fmanjoo and @MikeIsaac.

6,One of Bitcoin’s Biggest Champions Turns Bearish: DealBook Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/business/dealbook/bitcoin-fall-blockchain.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-22T12:18:28+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • One of bitcoin’s biggest champion has had a change of heart. • Prosecutors are said to be seeking Kushner records from Deutsche Bank. • Add BofA to the list of companies passing along some of their tax windfall to employees. • A bad day for Bitcoin, just as more people are trying to pile in. • AT&T and Time Warner change the deadline for their $85.4 billion deal. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. A note to readers: This is the last DealBook Briefing for 2017. Thanks for reading and for your feedback — we’ve appreciated every single comment and email. We’ll have more in store when we return on Jan. 2. Happy holidays! Michael Novogratz, the former Fortress executive, told Bloomberg that he was shelving plans for a cryptocurrency hedge fund and said Bitcoin will fall to $8,000. Mr. Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15. Bitcoin has fallen more than 40 percent the past four days. It hit a low of $10,776 Friday, down from $19,511 on Monday. The digital currency has since rebounded from its low and was recently at $13,268. Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and David Enrich of the NYT report that Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have sought bank records about entities associated with the family company of Jared Kushner. Click here to read the full story. The WSJ is reporting that Bank of America is handing out $1,000 bonuses to about 145,000 employees who earn up to $150,000. President Trump signed the tax bill into law Friday. Since Wednesday when the bill passed Congress, a growing list of companies have announced plans to pass some of their tax windfall to employees. AT&T and Comcast both will pay a $1,000 bonus to most of their workers in the United States. Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and Fifth Third are raising their minimum wage to $15. Fifth Third will give $1,000 bonuses to 13,500 of its 18,000 workers, while PNC Financial will pay $1,000 bonuses to about 47,500 employees. Boeing said it will spend $300 million on employee training, workplace infrastructure, and corporate giving. Some context on these moves from Breakingviews:  Bitcoin is down more than 30 percent and is approaching $10,000. The biggest cryptocurrency traded at a high of $19,511 on Monday. The selling has spilled over to other digital currencies. Ethereum and litecoin are off more than 35 percent. Such tumbles are hardly unusual for bitcoin, which is still up more than 1,300 percent this year. But the decline has some asking if the top is in. Here are some comments from around the web: Neil Wilson, ETX Capital, courtesy of MarketWatch: “Has the bubble finally popped? It’s hard to see the bell tolling just yet. We can easily see this market bounce back in very short order. Whilst there have been some hacks, public infighting in the mining community, lots of rumored forks and regulatory pressure building on some fronts, this is likely to be a simple bout of risk-off selling as investors rebalance towards year-end.” Ross Norman, Sharps Pixley, courtesy of Bloomberg: “The sharks are beginning to circle here, and the futures markets may give them a venue to strike. Bitcoin’s been heavily driven by retail investors, but there’ll be some aggressive funds looking for the right opportunity to hammer this thing lower.” Michael Jackson, Mangrove Capital Partners, courtesy of CNBC: “The vast majority of long term holders of bitcoin are still way in the money and have shown no sign of cashing out.” Where Bitcoin was on Sunday: $19,511 Where Bitcoin is this morning: $13,577 What Stephen Innes, the head of Asia-Pacific trading for Oannes, told Richard Frost and Eric Lam of Bloomberg: What does a top look like? Maybe like a host of companies rebranding themselves as having something to do with digital currency or blockchain technology. What gained a huge amount of attention yesterday, of course, was the beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea Corp. announcing that it was changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. and pivoting to virtual money. (It will still maintain a beverage division, of course.) What happened was predictable: But maybe we’re not at a top. Shane Chanel, a wealth adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers, told CNN Money that investors may just pile into other digital currencies, adding, “I feel the cryptocurrency madness is only beginning.” Goldman Sachs is jumping in The firm is opening a digital currency trading desk, according to Bloomberg. The firm already clears Bitcoin futures, one of the few banks on Wall Street to do so. Speaking of a Wall Street firm getting into Bitcoin, who said this late last month? Michel Temer, the president of Brazil, said the government would oppose the sale of a controlling stake in aircraft maker Embraer. Mr. Temer told reporters: Boeing and Embraer said Thursday that they are discussing potential business combinations after The Wall Street Journal reported the two were in takeover talks. A deal that gave Boeing control of Embraer, a crown jewel of Brazilian industry, would need government approval. From The WSJ: The companies now have until June 21 to complete their $85.4 billion transaction, according to a court filing. They pushed the deadline back after a trial date was set for the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the deal. The court hearings will begin on March 19, which wouldn’t give the two enough time to complete their transaction before the previous deadline of April 22. — Michael J. de la Merced Who didn’t see this coming? From the Qualcomm news release: Expect a lot more fighting between now and March 6, when Qualcomm is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting. — Michael J. de la Merced Eric Schmidt was more than the adult in the room during the early days of Google. He was the technology giant’s person in Washington, Brussels and Beijing. But does his departure as executive chairman next month mean that his services are no longer vital? It comes as Alphabet, now Google’s parent company, and other tech giants need friends in political capitals around the world — and Mr. Schmidt’s connections to previous administrations like the Obama White House may not be as useful. From Dai Wakabayashi, Katie Benner and Claire Miller of the NYT: The personal angle There was no mention in Google’s announcement about why Mr. Schmidt left. But one issue that has hung in the air is the executive’s well-known personal life — including the bringing of girlfriends to corporate events, the World Economic Forum in Davos and other occasions. The Information reported recently on how the hiring of Marcy Simon, a marketing expert who was in a relationship with Mr. Schmidt, at the company’s Android division caused some consternation in the unit. Critics’ corner • Shira Ovide writes, “Google isn’t in desperate need of more adults. But the rest of the technology industry might be.” (Gadfly) • Jennifer Saba writes, “Hiring a strong, independent chairwoman would reflect well on co-founders and controlling shareholders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in more ways than one.” (Breakingviews) Or, put another way, government funding has been extended until Jan. 19. The deadline was today. Yesterday’s votes in Congress to prevent a shutdown prevented Republicans from suffering an embarrassment so soon after passing their tax overhaul. But here’s what will confront lawmakers when they return to Washington next month: • What to do about the young immigrants known as Dreamers • Long-term funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program beyond March • The future of the warrantless wiretap program run by the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. The Washington flyaround • Conservative groups plan to spend millions on advertising extolling what they view as the benefits of the Republican tax cuts to a deeply skeptical public.

(WSJ) Sure, the iPhone maker’s shares have jumped this year, pushing its market value into uncharted territory above $900 billion. How long can the tech giant continue to breathe that rarefied air? Putting Apple’s market cap into context Courtesy of Jeff Sommer and Karl Russell of the NYT: • When adjusted for inflation, Apple’s market capitalization just recently surpassed Microsoft’s record high. At the heights of the dot-com bubble in 1999, Microsoft’s market capitalization peaked at $647 billion. • Apple’s share of the total stock market doesn’t even rank in the top 20, going back to 1925. Is Apple doing better in China? Morgan Stanley says that the iPhone X is helping stanch the flow of customers defecting from Apple to makers of cheaper smartphones. In a research note, the bank said that Apple has a 57 percent retention rate among iPhone users when they upgrade. That’s 20 percentage points higher than any other brand in China. Why is the country important to Apple? It accounted for nearly 20 percent of iPhone sales last quarter — and the iPhone accounts for more than 55 percent of Apple’s sales during that time. The battery controversy Yes, Apple is slowing down the performance of older iPhones. No, it’s not meant to force customers into buying newer models, it says.

7,The Can’t-Lose Way for Your Business to Pop: Add Bitcoin to Its Name,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/technology/bitcoin-blockchain-stock-market.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-21T22:51:02+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"It’s clear that a business idea is hot when companies that have nothing to do with the idea get involved. It’s clear that the idea has turned into a mania when investors reward companies for doing this.  And that’s exactly the case these days with Bitcoin and all of its ancillary concepts, including the blockchain, the ledger on which virtual currency transactions are recorded.  As the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent months, companies previously focused on making fitness apparel, cigars and beverages, among other things, have rebranded themselves as virtual currency or blockchain companies of one sort or another. And investors have cheered them on, pushing their stock prices up.  Here’s a look at some of the rebranded companies and their explanations. Long Island Iced Tea made iced teas in flavors including peach and lemon, as well as lemonades. On Thursday, the company, based in Farmingdale, N.Y., said it was shifting its corporate focus to the blockchain. The company said: “We view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry.” (December 21)   Vapetek made batteries and liquid for electronic cigarettes. In September, it rolled out a candy flavored e-liquid called Rock Kandi. This month, the Nevada-based company renamed itself and said it would shift to mining virtual currencies.  In the company’s words: “We are confident that cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology has a large market opportunity in the coming years and we look forward to growing the company and creating shareholder value, while helping to innovate the future of global currency.” (December 20)  Bioptix was a pharmaceutical company until this year. In October, the Colorado company said it was changing its name, making an investment in a Canadian virtual currency exchange and creating operations to mine Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  The company said that alongside its virtual currency business, it will continue to pursue “products for cattle, equine and swine for the assistance and facilitation of reproduction.” (October 4)  To become a public company, The Crypto Company acquired a small existing public company, Croe, which previously developed women’s fitness clothing.  The company said this summer that its “core services include consulting and advising companies regarding investment and trading in the digital asset market and investing in a manner that diversifies exposure to the growing class of digital assets.” (June 9) After the change, the Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned by the company’s actions, suspended trading of its stock.   On-Line was a small British company that previously incubated internet businesses. This fall, the company said it was renaming itself and shifting to focus on virtual currency technology.  The company said: “Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting area we have been working on for some time to provide systems to support the roll out of these technologies across a range of applications.” (October 26)  Rich Cigars previously produced cigars. But the Florida company said this month that it was changing its name, getting out of the cigar business, moving to Colorado and creating subsidiaries to mine for virtual currencies.  The company said it will be pursuing “the development of a unique cryptocurrency mining business for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which will operate on a 24/7 basis.” (December 14) 360 Capital Financial provided financial services to companies. In October, the Canadian company announced it would change its name and ticker symbol and begin investing exclusively in blockchain-based companies. The company said: “We are taking an all-round view to the 360 Blockchain Inc. business plan; with a mission to empower blockchain technologies with capital and experience to create exponential value.” (October 4) Leeta Gold was focused on mineral exploration in Canada, though with little apparent success. This summer, the company said it was acquiring a Bitcoin mining company, Genesis, with facilities in Iceland and renaming itself.  According to the company: “This transaction positions HIVE as a leading cryptocurrency miner in an attractive jurisdiction, Iceland, with low energy costs.” (June 14)",0.30505200000000005,0.03731204906204906
8,How the Winklevoss Twins Found Vindication in a Bitcoin Fortune,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/technology/bitcoin-winklevoss-twins.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-19T18:16:52+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The Winklevoss twins have carved an unorthodox path toward fame in the American business world. They went to Harvard University and then on to the Olympics as rowers. Along the way, they fought a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the ownership of Facebook. In the Oscar-nominated movie “The Social Network,” they were portrayed as uptight gentry, outwitted by Mr. Zuckerberg, the brilliant, budding tech mogul. Cameron, the left-handed Winklevoss brother, and Tyler, the right-handed one, followed that with a risky bet: They used money from a $65 million settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg to load up on Bitcoin. That turned them into the first prominent virtual currency millionaires in 2013, back when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug dealers. More than a few people in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street saw the towering twins as the naïve — if chiseled — faces of the latest tulip bulb mania. Many still do. But the soaring value of Bitcoin in recent months is giving the brothers a moment of vindication, and quite a bit more than that: Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. “We’ve turned that laughter and ridicule into oxygen and wind at our back,” Tyler Winklevoss said in an interview last week. It is unclear how fleeting their vindication, or their fortune, will be. Many Bitcoin aficionados are expecting a major correction to the recent spike in its value, which has gone from $1,000 for one coin at the beginning of the year to around $18,500 on Tuesday. If nothing else, the growing fortune of the 36-year-old Winklevoss twins is a reminder that for all the small investors getting into Bitcoin this year, the biggest winners have been a relatively small number of early holders who had plenty of money to start with and have been riding a price roller coaster for years. (The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is believed by researchers to  be holding on to Bitcoin worth around $19 billion.) Some of these new Bitcoin millionaires are cashing out and buying Lamborghinis, professional hockey teams or even low-risk bond funds. The Winklevoss twins, though, said they had no intention to diversify. “We still think it is probably one of the best investments in the world and will be for the decades to come,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “And if it’s not, we’d rather live with disappointment than regret.” They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum. The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which most likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make each of them a billionaire. They have sold almost none of their original holdings. While they both have apartments in downtown Manhattan, they say they live relatively spartan lives with few luxuries. Cameron drives an old S.U.V.; Tyler doesn’t have a car at all. The Winklevoss twins’ financial rise began during their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in 2008. Their lawyers urged them to take the $45 million (after lawyers’ fees) in cash. But they wanted to be paid in shares of Facebook. “The lawyers thought we were crazy,” Cameron Winklevoss said last week. “We thought they were crazy for taking cash.” By the time Facebook went public in 2012, their stock was worth around $300 million, their rowing careers were over, and they were looking for something new. When they began buying Bitcoin in late 2012, the price of an individual coin was below $10. Few people in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street had publicly expressed interest in the virtual currency. Over a few months, the brothers bought 1 percent of all the outstanding Bitcoin at the time — some 120,000 tokens. As they did, the price soared, making their Bitcoin portfolio worth around $11 million by the time they went public with it in April 2013. Their buying spree was mocked at the time, and a few of their early decisions fueled that derision. They also invested in Bitinstant, one of the first companies to trade Bitcoins online. Bitinstant’s executives, in fact, had tutored the brothers in the basics of Bitcoin. The chief executive of Bitinstant, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014, accused of helping to supply Bitcoins to users of online drug markets. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was sentenced to a year in jail. The Winklevosses were never implicated in the wrongdoing, which happened before they became investors. While that drama was unfolding, the twins applied to create the first Bitcoin exchange traded fund, or E.T.F., an investment product that would hold Bitcoins but be traded on stock exchanges. That brought more criticism from people who wondered why someone would buy a fund rather than Bitcoin itself. In March, regulators rejected the application. On top of all that, until last year the price of Bitcoin was sliding and the virtual currency concept was looking wobbly. But the Winklevosses, who once bet that years of punishing rowing practices would take them to the Olympics, held their ground. “We are very comfortable in very high-risk environments with absolutely no guarantee of success,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “I don’t mean existing in that environment for days, weeks or months. I mean year after year.” They sold some of their tokens to pay for Gemini, a name that means twins in Latin. Like the Bitcoin E.T.F., their investment in Gemini was driven by their experience with the difficulty of buying and securely storing Bitcoin. Every Bitcoin sits in an address that can be accessed only with the corresponding password, or private key. The problem with this system is that anyone who gets hold of a private key can easily take the Bitcoin. And unlike money taken from a bank account, stolen Bitcoin are essentially impossible to retrieve. A number of virtual currency exchanges and wallets have collectively lost billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to thieves. The Winklevosses came up with an elaborate system to store and secure their own private keys. They cut up printouts of their private keys into pieces and then distributed them in envelopes to safe deposit boxes around the country, so if one envelope were stolen the thief would not have the entire key. With Gemini, they have created a high-tech version of this process to hold customer money. Getting into the company’s wallets requires multiple signatures from cryptographically sealed devices that were never linked to the internet. Gemini got a license from New York State regulators that allows them to hold Bitcoins for regulated banks and asset managers — something essentially no other virtual currency companies can do. That has turned Gemini into one of the most trusted destinations for sophisticated investors. “Gemini is an underappreciated exchange, one of the few exchanges I trust as a custodian,” said Ari Paul, a managing partner at the virtual currency hedge fund BlockTower Capital. Gemini is now expanding from its old 5,000-square-foot offices to new, 35,000-square-foot facilities in Midtown Manhattan. This doesn’t mean Gemini or the Winklevosses have ironed out all the kinks. Like many other exchanges, Gemini has struggled to stay online in the deluge of new customers in recent weeks. These growing pains are part of the reason the brothers say they are holding on to their Bitcoin. They believe virtual currencies are still a long way from real mainstream adoption. They said they might look at selling when the value of all the Bitcoin in circulation approaches the value of all gold in the world — some $7 trillion or $8 trillion compared with the $310 billion value of all Bitcoin on Tuesday — given that they think Bitcoin is set to replace gold as a rare commodity. But then Tyler Winklevoss questioned even that, pointing out the ways that he believes Bitcoin is better than gold. “In a funny way, I’m not sure we’d even sell there,” he said. “Bitcoin is more than gold — it’s a programmable store of money.

Here’s what we’re watching: • The Winklevoss Twins’ unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune • There is a paucity of women in corporate America’s c-suites. • Not every analyst is in love with Apple’s stock price. • A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return. • Apollo’s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin. That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting. The New York Times’s Nathaniel Popper takes a closer look at the twin’s big bet on virtual currencies. • They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012. • They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10. • At a time when other Bitcoin millionaires are cashing out and buying Lamborghinis, professional hockey teams or even low-risk bond funds, the Winklevoss twins said they had no intention to diversify and have sold almost none of their original holdings. • They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum. • The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires. And that’s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue. Here is Breakingviews’s take:  What catalyst will propel Apple’s market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple’s services business? While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple’s market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark. But Nomura Instinet’s Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple’s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote: Apple’s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X. Bloomberg notes that downgrades of Apple’s stock don’t happen too often. — Stephen Grocer Germany’s Federal Cartel Office published preliminary findings from a 20-month investigation that Facebook abused its dominant position as a social network in Germany to collect user data from third parties. The Wall Street Journal reports: The investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few: • The European Union fined Google a record $2.7 billion for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals. • The European Union ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. • The European Union ordered Luxembourg to collect around $293 million in unpaid taxes from Amazon. • The European Union fined Facebook nearly $130 million for providing misleading information about its acquisition of WhatsApp. • The French government filed a complaint with the Paris Commerce Court against Amazon for abusing its dominant position with some suppliers. So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives. At a hearing on Russia’s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: “You have to be the ones to do something about this. Or we will.” As Heard on the Street’s Dan Gallagher wrote: Over the past five years, an index that tracks hedge fund performance has risen 27.83 percent. Over the past four years, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund exceeded that by nearly 1,000 times. The Pantera fund told investors on Tuesday that its lifetime return has been 25,004 percent — mostly by buying early into Bitcoin. (That number is bigger now, since the return was calculated last week, when the digital currency reached $15,500.) Not every investor in the fund enjoyed this eye-popping result, but Pantera’s compound annual return has been about 250 percent.

(FT) • The analyst Frederick Cannon of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods says that Bitcoin’s blockbuster rise is hurting its chances of becoming a viable currency.

What Apollo is getting: The country’s second-biggest Mexican restaurant chain, which operates and franchises more than 700 restaurants. Why Jack in the Box is selling: The deal is “consistent with the company’s desire to transition to a less capital-intensive business model.” Read another way, that says, “We don’t want to own and operate so many restaurants.” Roughly 53 percent of Qdoba’s restaurants are company-owned-and-operated, compared to just 12 percent of Jack in the Box restaurants. The advisers For Apollo: Deutsche Bank, PJ Solomon, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison For Jack in the Box and Qdoba: Morgan Stanley, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher -- Michael J. de la Merced Deep in the WSJ’s story on the company’s new hope — its QNX software that could be used to power self-driving cars — is a nugget of potential deal news: two big investors could back a sale of the company. More from David George-Cosh and Jacque McNish of the WSJ: The publication adds that in the past, Samsung and Oracle had come knocking, interested in BlackBerry’s patents. But the company’s C.E.O., John Chen has rejected them, with the blessing of big shareholders. The context: BlackBerry had hired JPMorgan Chase and RBC Capital Markets in 2012 to weigh a potential sale of the company. In 2013, co-founder Mike Lazaridis reached out to private equity firms about helping him take the company private. And yet in 2017, BlackBerry is still a publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of 7.6 billion Canadian dollars, or $5.9 billion. American shares in BlackBerry were up less than 1 percent in early-morning trading today, at $11.02. — Michael J. de la Merced Get ready to pull out your very tiny violin.

I want low taxes for all — not ZERO for more folks. Where’s my dollar?” How big companies will be affected Tech companies like Microsoft that stash huge amounts of foreign profits offshore are set to take a hit from the overhaul, which would impose a 10.5 percent tax on overseas earnings, according to the WSJ. That could induce some to return to the United States, which, as the WSJ points out, could reduce the country’s trade deficit. Meanwhile, five financial giants including Citigroup, Bank of America and A.I.G. could collectively take a $50 billion hit, according to the FT. More in taxes • The Republican Senators Susan Collins and Mike Lee said that they would support the tax proposal, further ensuring its passage in a vote scheduled for today. (The Hill) • Bob Corker said that he faced a “tough decision” in deciding to support the tax overhaul after initially opposing it — and he denied pushing for a last-minute change that would benefit him personally. (NYT) • Mr. Trump outlined a national security strategy that called Russia and China competitors to American dominance. But he ignored investigations into Russian interference in last year’s presidential election and may not meaningfully change the American trade deficit with China.

(NYT) • Matthew Petersen, who was nominated by the White House for a federal judgeship but drew scorn when he couldn’t answer basic legal questions, has withdrawn his candidacy. (NYT) Mr. Skipper, who stepped down yesterday as president of the sports powerhouse, citing a “substance addiction,” was once one of The Walt Disney Company’s most important moneymakers. For now, Disney has appointed George Bodenheimer, a former ESPN president, as acting chairman for 90 days. More on potential permanent replacements from Lucas Shaw and Eben Novy-Williams of Bloomberg: The context Mr. Skipper assumed control of the sports network when it was one of the most formidable media properties on the planet, able to command high carriage fees from pay-television providers given its popularity. But as cable TV providers lose customers to streaming services, ESPN has shed subscribers and resorted to layoffs.  The deal angle Mr. Skipper is stepping down days after Disney announced a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. Among the assets that would be included in the transaction are Fox’s 22 regional sports networks, which could be combined with ESPN to shore up Disney’s sports holdings. Whoever takes over ESPN will also oversee the introduction of one of Disney’s big initiatives: a new sports-focused streaming service, ESPN Plus. Extra credit: Sports Illustrated spoke with several ESPN employees who said they were shocked. “He just signed a new contract,” one said. “He just gave us this rah-rah speech at the mandatory meeting. No one knows what to think.” Pro sports teams are going for big numbers these days, and the Carolina Panthers — who almost won the Super Bowl last year — are assuredly going to earn Mr. Richardson a windfall, even as he faces numerous accusations of improperly touching and harassing women and using a racial slur. Forbes estimates that the team could be worth $2.3 billion. What works in the Panthers’ favor, according to Ken Belson of the NYT: Remembering why the team is selling From Juliet Macur’s latest Sports of the Times column in the NYT: In other misconduct news: Microsoft said that it would eliminate forced arbitration agreements with employees who make sexual harassment claims, one of the most prominent companies to do so, according to the NYT. Exhibit A: Campbell agreed to buy Snyder’s-Lance, the maker of Kettle Chips and Pop Secret, for roughly $4.8 billion in cash. Exhibit B: Hershey agreed to buy Amplify Snack Brands, the maker of Skinny Pop popcorn, for about $902 million (or $1.6 billion including debt). Both Campbell and Hershey are trying to diversify from their core food products, soup and chocolate. Both have had stagnant sales in recent years. The advantage of pursuing Snyder’s-Lance and Amplify is that they focus on somewhat more healthful snacks, a category that has risen in popularity. Critics corner • Lauren Silva Laughlin writes of the Snyder’s-Lance deal, “Big family shareholders are an obstacle to any outside investor trying to derail the deal, which is a pity because Campbell is on course to destroy shareholder value.” (Breakingviews) • Tara Lachapelle writes, “Here come those desperate-looking food deals we told you about.” (Gadfly) Shares in the social networking company jumped 11 percent yesterday, in one of their biggest one-day leaps in the past year. Possible reasons • JPMorgan Chase’s Doug Anmuth upgraded the stock’s price target to $27 from $20 and called the company one of the “top small and mid-cap ideas in 2018.” • Jonathan Kees of Summit Redstone began coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a price target of $26, adding, “now is the time to jump in.” How to grade the Twitter recovery in 2018 • Whether daily average user numbers continue to grow • Whether a renewed focus on live events brings in advertisers In other news: In other news: Twitter banned several accounts tied to Britain First, the far-right group that produced an anti-Muslim video retweeted by Mr. Trump. • Tony Ressler, a co-founder of Ares Management, said that he would step down as chief executive and would become executive chairman.

10,"A Bitcoin Hedge Fund’s Return: 25,004% (That Wasn’t a Typo)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/technology/bitcoin-hedge-fund.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-19T10:00:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — There are hedge funds with blockbuster returns. Then there is the Pantera Bitcoin Fund. The fund — one of the first in the world to dedicate itself to virtual currencies — released its returns in a letter sent to investors on Tuesday. The figure for the life of the fund, which was set up in 2013, is eye popping: 25,004 percent. A significant portion of the gains have come this year, thanks to the skyrocketing price of an individual Bitcoin, which hit $19,000 on Monday. (The fund’s 25,004 percent figure was actually counted back when Bitcoin was at $15,500, a week ago.) For comparison, the top performing hedge fund in the world last year returned 148 percent, according to Preqin, a hedge fund tracker. Since 2013, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund’s compound annual returns have been around 250 percent. The Pantera Bitcoin Fund did not have to do much to get those returns. It just bought Bitcoins and held them as the price went up. Its performance is a reminder of the unprecedented gains that Bitcoin has experienced, with some analysts arguing that Bitcoin’s moves have been even greater than the movements of Dutch tulip bulb prices back in the 1600s. But Dan Morehead, who founded Pantera Capital and the fund after a career at Goldman Sachs, said it was not an easy decision to create a Bitcoin-focused hedge fund in 2013, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug markets. “The first hard part was actually deciding to launch a cryptocurrency fund when everyone else thought that was crazy,” he said on Monday. Many of the investors in the Pantera fund have not enjoyed its full 25,004 percent return. Some bought in at the beginning and then sold out when Bitcoin’s price was in a slow steady decline during 2014 and 2015. Others bought in during the current boom and have reaped only the returns that Bitcoin has experienced over the last year. Those still aren’t bad, at around 1,900 percent. Those gains have given Pantera a lot of competition. More than 150  hedge funds focused on virtual currencies have been created this year, bringing the total number of such funds to 175, according to the research firm Autonomous Next. Pantera estimated that in dollar terms, the fund has made $2.1 billion for its investors. Investors have taken out Bitcoins worth around $1.7 billion to hold for themselves, to avoid paying Pantera’s 0.75 percent annual fees. That has left Pantera holding coins worth $400 million. Overall, investors originally put about $150 million into the fund. Like all hedge funds, Pantera is open only to accredited investors with significant assets. The minimum investment is $50,000. The relatively straightforward strategy of the Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which has offices in San Francisco, could be replicated by small investors buying and holding Bitcoins. But in its investor letter, Pantera noted that investors who go through Coinbase, the most popular service with small investors, pay fees ranging from 1.5 percent to 4 percent each time they buy or sell Bitcoin, creating more costs than Pantera charges its investors. The Pantera Bitcoin Fund has developed strategies for buying and selling at good prices and also buys and holds an alternative to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, which was created this summer. Mr. Morehead said his fund has been attractive because it allows investors access to Bitcoin without going to Bitcoin exchanges, the places where people buy and sell the tokens, which have been hacked many times in recent years. Several of the fund’s early investors came from the top ranks of the enormous asset manager the Fortress Investment Group. One of them, Michael Novogratz, is looking to start his own $500 million virtual currency hedge fund. There have been a number of attempts to set up a similar fund for small investors, a so-called exchange traded fund, or E.T.F. So far, though, regulators have rejected those efforts. Meanwhile, Pantera has expanded its own offerings with six other funds. Most recently, it began the Pantera Digital Asset Fund, which owns 25 virtual currencies, including several that were created through so-called initial coin offerings. Mr. Morehead said there is a chance that the value of a Bitcoin could plummet to zero, given how early and undeveloped the technology still is. He said he tells investors to put only around 1 percent of their net worth in virtual currencies. But he thinks that 1 percent could do very well. “There are a lot of famous people who have said Bitcoin is a joke,” he said on Monday. “They might be right. But if they are wrong and it goes up 25 times, they are missing out on a huge trade.”",0.11078333333333333,0.12838010204081635
11,The Bitcoin Boom: In Code We Trust,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/opinion/bitcoin-boom-technology-trust.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-19T00:06:20+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"You don’t need brilliant financial analysis skills to notice that Bitcoin is in a bubble. It has grown in value from about 39 cents to over $18,000 in just eight years and recently attracted broad media attention by doubling in just a few days. The conventional wisdom had been that illegal and illicit transactions — buying drugs or transferring money out of Argentina — accounted for much of Bitcoin’s value. Today the mainstream view sees mere greed and speculation. Yet as Bitcoin continues to grow, there’s reason to think something deeper and more important is going on. Bitcoin’s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code. It is a trend that transcends finance: In our fear of human error, we are putting an increasingly deep faith in technology. Bitcoin may be in a bubble, but not all bubbles are created equal. Some are shimmering nothings, reflecting little more than an underlying pyramid scheme. But others are like ocean swells that could become enormous waves. Consider the tech stocks of the late 1990s — a bubble, to be sure, but in retrospect, was Amazon really overvalued? What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like ’90s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: Where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over. Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other people’s money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change. We might add that major governments — the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks and enforcers of contracts — do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens — Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the world’s citizens might be looking for alternatives. Bitcoin’s fans don’t entirely distrust human institutions. It is rather that they’d prefer not to need to trust humans to keep their promises, when we know that we humans are deeply fallible. That might seem cynical, but perhaps it is appropriately humble. As Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym for the person or persons who invented Bitcoin, puts it, “the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.” This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a “blockchain,” a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn’t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested. This isn’t to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.",0.16332,0.038747795414462084

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Mike: Good day to you, Farhad! Are you enjoying holiday party season? I haven’t gone to any so far, but I plan on making up for that by going to three in a row this evening. Is there such a thing as “nog overdose”? Farhad: Mike, nobody’s buying your act. “Nog overdose” is practically your middle name at this time of the year. Please nog responsibly. Mike: Right, well, I’ll be sure to pop a few Lactaids before my magical journey this evening. (Also, to be clear, eggnog is disgusting.) O.K., we should get into tech news this week! Let’s start with the obvious: net neutrality. On Thursday, the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, rolled back a set of rules that guaranteed an open internet for Americans, a sweeping move that basically the entire internet is mad about. Before the vote, researchers found that millions of the comments supporting the move on the F.C.C.’s website were actually fake bots. That did little to stop the agency from moving forward. Pai’s stance is to say it’s pro-competition to unravel regulations. Pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley says that that’s bogus and that consumers will lose, while big corporations like Comcast will have free rein to jack up prices for different types of internet services. I fall in the latter camp. Farhad: Well, you’re right that everyone in Silicon Valley is against this repeal, but I think it’s interesting to note the shift in intensity. In the past, the tech giants, especially Google, took a much more forceful approach to defend such regulations. As I’ve argued, net neutrality is now not very important to the giants. In fact, because it protects start-ups from large companies, the biggest tech companies might be better off under the new neutrality-free rules. And as it turns out, the biggest tech companies have taken a back seat in the fight, as you and several of our colleagues reported this week. Mike: Well, yeah. As an aside, Pai really seems to want to be liked by people, going as far as to create a parody video with a supportive publication. I don’t think it’s working. So, what say you here? I assume you’re with me, though since you like to be contrarian on occasion perhaps you’re going to go for the pro-Pai argument? Farhad: I think it’s bad for the internet. I don’t think the end of net neutrality will spark an immediate change, but instead it will be a gradual corporatization. Slowly, big internet and telecom companies will have more and more of a say over what we do online, and start-ups will face a tougher time. Over the long run, the internet will become more like cable TV — you’ll pay for different bundles of services. Mike: Yes, well, I’m already starting to throw my spare change in a Mason jar labeled “Netflix fees” in my kitchen. Moving on, I wanted to get into a slightly wonky, somewhat overlooked section of the internet: Patreon and the uproar among its creative community. If you aren’t familiar, Patreon is basically a payments platform used by artists and creative types, where they can charge or offer subscriptions to people for the types of things they produce. It ranges from writers and humorists to artists, journalists, crafty people, gamers — really whatever service you think people will pay to receive. It’s been growing, and has an indie flair to an ancient practice. (“Patrons” were quite common among artists hundreds of years ago.) Anyway, that whole community went nuts when Patreon abruptly changed its fee structure recently, imposing what many called undue fees and really messing up the economics for many artists who came to rely on the platform. It didn’t take long for the company to do an abrupt about-face and “press pause” on the structure change. Who knows if that lasts? Farhad: I was watching this closely. I think the rise of Patreon is one of the most interesting things on the internet in the last couple of years. Internet ads have proved to be a terrible business model for most online content; by paying artists directly through services like Patreon, we’re seeing a much more vibrant community of podcasters, video makers and other artists online. But Patreon is also a business that has promised huge gains to its investors, so it’ll be interesting to see how it manages these two audiences. This time it seemed to go too far in the direction of its investors; perhaps now that it’s been burned, it’ll keep a closer eye on its indie artists. Mike: Finally, let’s talk a little more about Bitcoin. I apologize in advance, since it’s pretty much the only thing finance that Twitter can think about these days. There’s even a ticker on CNBC for the price of Bitcoin now! Anyway, I had a theory the other day that revolves around the user interface of Coinbase, one of the most popular exchanges for buying Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the United States. Basically it went like this: The price of one Bitcoin is staggeringly high right now, somewhere around $17,000. My guess is that high price will make the two currencies that you can also buy in Coinbase — Ether and Litecoin — more attractive to casual consumers who really don’t know anything about digital currency except that it’s something that they could make money off of. Since the price of Ether and Litecoin are exponentially lower than Bitcoin at the moment, I predicted people would start buying those en masse. Sure enough, a day later, both of the other currencies experienced a run-up in price. Yes, this is an extended way of saying, “Look how smart I am.” But also, it’s more: Do you think we’re basically creating artificial, overinflated value in these alternative currencies that really has no long-term staying power? And do we think a plethora of other, potentially scam alternative currencies may draft on the surging power of Bitcoin? (Hint: The answer is “yes.”) Farhad: Uh, yes. No, seriously, I think for once you have a point. There’s no earthly way that Litecoin becomes something people will use and consider valuable in the future. It’s obviously being run up by bubbly speculation. But Bitcoin? I think it’s got a chance. Anyway, have fun with your nog. See you! Mike: See you later!

Chinese consumers have pulled back their spending, blowing a $9 billion hole in Apple’s recent quarterly revenue. China was again a culprit when Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations, though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centers. Intel, the big chip maker, cited intensifying “trade and macro concerns” for financial results in January that did not meet expectations. And Samsung, another semiconductor powerhouse, said sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones. China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand. Warnings about a sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Micron Technology and Western Digital. It’s an abrupt reversal, coming on the heels of stellar results in 2018 for the business that gave Silicon Valley its name. Last year, manufacturers shipped a staggering 1 trillion chips and other semiconductor devices, 10 percent more than the year before, IC Insights estimates. But 2019 is shaping up to be a much different story, now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampening. The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust. Back then, investors showed no mercy. Intel made what seemed a modest adjustment to its revenue forecast for the third quarter of 2000, saying it would be up 3 to 5 percent instead of 7 to 9 percent. The value of the company immediately fell by nearly 30 percent over the next few days. This year, with a similar downgrade, investors largely shrugged it off. Intel shed about 5 percent of its value over a week. While acknowledging the parallels to 2000, Gene Munster, research director for Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, said, “I think it’s different this time.” Back then, among the best customers for the established chip firms were start-ups, which had more dreams than revenue. As the start-ups faltered, the chip firms were imperiled. The storm lasted for years. “These are all real companies now, with real customers,” Mr. Munster said. “People are willing to look past a few bumpy months.” Even if the problems do not linger, they are a reminder that demand is not eternal. That seems to be what happened with smartphones, which use multiple varieties of chips to run software, process data and connect to cellular networks. Consider Apple, which gave a muted forecast in October for the holiday season and followed up early last month with its first full-fledged revenue warning in 16 years. The iPhone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in China. Total smartphone shipments fell 15 percent in that country in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Canalys. Michael Wolf, who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm Activate, said people seem to be shifting to lower-priced phone models and cheaper service plans. But he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like Netflix, video games, online advertising and business-to-business sales for companies like Microsoft. “From all of our research, I don’t see some general consumer malaise,” Mr. Wolf said. Yet several other businesses appear to be softening as well, including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Sales of high-priced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like Intel and Nvidia, but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautious. “Cloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity,” Robert Swan, who was then Intel’s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said on a conference call after Intel released its fourth-quarter results. (On Thursday, Mr. Swan became Intel’s chief executive.) Longtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips, an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the United States and rivals in Japan and South Korea. Makers of a key category called dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industry. During the dot-com bust of 2001, DRAM revenue plummeted 63 percent while total semiconductor revenue fell 31 percent, according to Gartner data. But conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits, leaving three major DRAM makers — Samsung, Hynix and Micron. They have been slow to boost production, enabling them to keep their prices high. And they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones, data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most sales. “The markets today are structurally different,” Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron’s chief executive, said in a recent interview. Yet market cycles haven’t disappeared entirely. DRAM prices peaked last June and began sliding, prompting Micron and Samsung to issue their recent profit warnings. DRAMeXchange, a Taiwan-based firm that tracks the market, predicts DRAM prices will fall an additional 20 percent in the first quarter. Memory chips “behave like onions or steel or any other commodity,” said Jim Handy, a market researcher at Objective Analysis. “If there is an oversupply, prices fall.” Nvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust. The 25-year-old company, which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games, became one of Silicon Valley’s most valuable companies in 2017 as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giants. But Nvidia’s processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency, driving a surge in demand that inflated prices and created a shortage of chips. Buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders, making it hard for the company to get a handle on conventional demand for its technology. The cryptocurrency bubble faded suddenly last year, causing Nvidia’s revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips. The crypto issue “ended up being way, way bigger” for the company than expected, said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. “It’s been a crazy story.” For all the turmoil, industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain a lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps. For one thing, a series of mergers has reduced price competition. Companies like Micron, which routinely lost money in past cycles, are expected to remain solidly profitable even if sales dip. Beyond that, there is the glorious future. “Eventually the storm will pass and these companies — Nvidia, Apple, Samsung — will have a pole position in the next tech growth curve, including A.I., health care, self-driving cars, 5G,” said Mr. Munster, the Loup analyst. “The curve is so exciting, so juicy, so full of opportunity.”",0.08577627118644068,0.012186743341404354
14,What Is Bitcoin Really Worth? Don’t Even Ask.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/business/bitcoin-investing.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-15T12:00:27+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Dabbling in Bitcoin lies somewhere between gambling and investing. After all, true investing requires a rational appraisal of an asset’s value and that is simply not possible at present with Bitcoin. Real understanding of the economic issues underlying the cryptocurrency is almost nonexistent. It is not just that very few people really comprehend the technology behind Bitcoin. It is that no one can attach objective probabilities to the various possible outcomes of the current Bitcoin enthusiasm. How can we even start estimating the fundamental value of Bitcoin, with its astonishing market value of more than $275 billion? Any attempt will soon sound silly. Let’s try for just a moment. It is possible to imagine a future in which Bitcoin eventually replaces some fraction of money as we know it today. Suppose that happens soon. Note that one measure of the United States money supply, M1, is today worth more than $3.6 trillion. But don’t get too excited. Will Bitcoin really replace a large fraction of conventional money? There are reasons to be skeptical. Bitcoin is vastly more volatile than conventional money and relatively few people trust it as a store of value. Even if that hurdle is crossed, how much cryptocurrency will people need? Putting it in economic terms, will the demand for Bitcoin have the same velocity as the demand for money? Will there be the same number of hoarders? And what about all the other cryptocurrencies that exist today, and those that will arise in the future? Bitcoin might well be replaced by something different and better, and end up being worth nothing at all. I won’t go further down this road. Many people are making analogous attempts to put a fundamental value on Bitcoin — but such efforts will be intrinsically and absurdly inaccurate. The results of a serious attempt to assess the value of Bitcoin can only be ambiguous. Ambiguity in economics is an important and developing subject. Many academic economists still embrace the efficient markets theory: the belief that markets generally respond accurately to genuine new information about fundamentals, and react only to such information. But Bitcoin is an example of ambiguity, and the efficient market theory does not capture what is going on in the market for this cryptocurrency. There has not been enough genuine new information coming in day after day to rationally justify Bitcoin’s huge price swings. Something else is afoot. One narrative that seeks to explain the price increases this year is that they have something to do with the difficulty of betting against — making short sales of — Bitcoin. Absent the opportunity to engage in short sales, “smart money” can only watch from the sidelines while prices soar. Or so the efficient market theory claims. But pessimistic investors hoping to profit from a Bitcoin price fall actually have had the opportunity to make negative investments for a while. Bitcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex allow shorting of Bitcoins, and it is possible to short Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded notes on online brokerages like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, GBTC. Both of these options suffer from lack of liquidity and of trust in these new institutions; GBTC has not tracked Bitcoin prices accurately, for example. Still, if enough people had managed to take a short position, that might have helped to limit the increases in Bitcoin prices that we have seen. It is possible that the Bitcoin market will change in a meaningful way now, given the decision of Cboe, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, to start a Bitcoin futures market on Dec. 10 and of the CME Group to do so on Dec. 18. The academic literature tells us that volatility of an underlying asset often falls after the establishment of new futures markets for it. But the ability to short an asset more easily won’t necessarily overcome the power of investor excitement. In 1936, John Maynard Keynes suggested why. He played down the role of quantitative analysis and probability estimates in human thinking of the assessment of ambiguous future events. People in such situations are vulnerable to a play of emotions and at times a “spontaneous urge to action” that he called “animal spirits.” He argued that much of what happens in financial markets has to do with people learning, from price movements, about each other’s animal spirits. I believe that Mr. Keynes was correct about animal spirits in general and how they affect markets like the one for Bitcoin. George Akerlof and I expanded on his perspective in our 2009 book Animal Spirits, which argued that the driving force behind human enterprise cannot be reduced to the rational optimization emphasized by traditional economics. Darwinian evolution produced a human species whose behavior sometimes seems to be emotionally driven. Neuroscientists, psychologists and economists are leading us toward new models of human decision-making. They may help to explain phenomena like the Bitcoin price rise. Scott Huettel, a Duke neurologist, and other researchers showed in 2006, for example, that when making decisions involving ambiguity, people do not use the parts of the brain required for calculations of probabilities and expected values. And the economists Anat Bracha of the Boston Federal Reserve and Donald Brown of Yale have provided an alternative to conventional economic theory of human behavior under uncertainty. They define a different kind of rationality — one based on Mr. Keynes’ views, not on calculations of utility — in ambiguous situations. Furthermore, a paper by neuroscientists including Benjamin Lu that was presented at the Society for Neuroeconomics annual convention in Toronto in October, showed that psychologically stressful experiences can result in changes in neurological processes when ambiguous situations arise. In short, the Bitcoin market is a marvelous case study in ambiguity and animal spirits. It is providing invaluable information about how millions of human brains process stimuli coming, in this case, from public acceptance, imagination, and innovation surrounding cryptocurrencies. This is fascinating from a psychological and neurological perspective. But it isn’t grounded in solid economics. No wonder the Bitcoin market has been so chaotic.",0.18805471698113205,0.06244300598074183
15,I Was Wrong About Bitcoin. Here’s Why.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/technology/bitcoin-predictions.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-12T21:33:50+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Several years ago, tech enthusiasts in San Francisco began buzzing about a new and mysterious thing called Bitcoin. There were rumors that the virtual money, invented by a pseudonymous math genius named Satoshi Nakamoto, would revolutionize modern finance and render government-backed currency obsolete. Or maybe it was just a passing fad. I wanted to understand the phenomenon for myself. So in 2013, I bought a single Bitcoin, a clunky and labor-intensive process that involved going to a CVS and using MoneyGram to wire the dollar value of a Bitcoin — which was around $140 at the time — to a cryptocurrency exchange. I sold my Bitcoin a week later for a small loss, thoroughly unimpressed with the experience and pessimistic about the virtual money’s prospects. “The Bitcoin dream is all but dead,” I wrote. Hoo boy, did I blow it. Today, the Bitcoin I sold for about $140 would be worth more than $15,000, and cryptomania has seized the entire world. As of this week, Bitcoin futures are trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Coinbase, the largest consumer trading platform for Bitcoin, briefly crashed last week because of a huge influx of traffic. And while experts are warning that the exuberance around Bitcoin is a classic sign of a bubble, few think it will disappear altogether even in the event of a crash. [ALSO READ: What is Bitcoin and How Does it Work?] What happened? Why did so many people — myself included — get Bitcoin so spectacularly wrong? After a couple of weeks of thinking about it, I can point to at least five bad assumptions I made. I assumed that Bitcoin’s future depended on its everyday use. In the early days of Bitcoin, its proponents envisioned people using cryptocurrencies to buy food, pay their rent and make other day-to-day purchases. Eager to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream, they set up Bitcoin ATMs to facilitate easy transfers and encouraged their local restaurants and bars to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Today, though, hardly anyone is spending Bitcoin on actual goods and services. (Why would you, if the value could jump 40 percent in two days, as it did last week?) And few merchants have gone through the hassle of updating their systems to accept cryptocurrency. “The disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation is striking,” a team of Morgan Stanley economists wrote earlier this year. As it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising. I assumed that the blockchain would eclipse Bitcoin itself. One of the earliest predictions among Bitcoin skeptics and boosters alike was that Bitcoin itself would be just a predecessor technology to the real, lasting innovation: the blockchain — the peer-to-peer ledger system that records cryptocurrency transactions and allows them to operate without a central authority. I agreed, thinking that the blockchain had real promise, but that Bitcoin would ultimately fade away. Four years later, there has, in fact, been enormous hype around blockchain projects. (One British company added the word “blockchain” to its name and saw its shares immediately jump nearly 400 percent.) But that frenzy hasn’t detracted from investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin itself — in fact, it has amplified it. And the potential applicability of blockchain technology to all kinds of different industries, from auto manufacturing to insurance to groceries, has inspired lots of non-techies to learn about cryptocurrencies, and served as an intellectual on-ramp for new Bitcoin investors. I assumed that regulators would crack down faster. In the frontier days of cryptocurrency, it seemed that every other story was about how criminals and tax-evaders were using Bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods and services. A huge dark-net narcotics market, Silk Road, was broken up, and its owner was sentenced to life in prison. Several large cryptocurrency sites suffered hacks and thefts. It was easy to think that these problems would lead regulators to take swift action against Bitcoin. But regulators have been late to the game. The I.R.S. didn’t issue official guidance on the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies until 2014, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has just recently started to look at whether initial coin offerings, a kind of public auction of new cryptocurrencies, should be more closely regulated. [ALSO READ: Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy] Partly, this is because some Trump-era regulators seem more interested in rolling back existing rules than making new ones. But it’s also a reflection of the way regulators tend to operate — many are reactive, and Bitcoin is still a relatively esoteric product that hasn’t claimed many real-world victims yet. There might well be a regulatory reckoning as Bitcoin moves closer to the mainstream, but for now, it’s still the Wild West. I assumed that Wall Street would stay away. Back in 2013, when I began asking Wall Street bankers about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their reactions ranged from polite dismissal to outright mockery. Few thought digital currency had any chance of succeeding, and many shared the view of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who has called Bitcoin a “fraud” that would only appeal to murderers and drug dealers. But banks are ultimately service businesses, and I underestimated Wall Street’s philosophical flexibility when confronted with a new product that its clients really wanted to trade. Now, in the same way that the rise of junk bonds created an entirely new lucrative finance niche in the 1980s, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent has pulled even the most traditional financial institutions into the fray. There are now dozens of cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds, and even Goldman Sachs is clearing Bitcoin futures transactions for some clients. The arrival of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market has begun to make Bitcoin look less like a fringe technology project, and more like any other securities market. I assumed that Bitcoin’s extreme volatility would be a turnoff. When Bitcoin’s price was swinging wildly between $100 and $200, sometimes within a few days, I thought to myself, “Who would sign up for such a roller-coaster ride?” I naïvely thought that what people liked about money was its stability, and knowing that $100 today would still be worth $100 tomorrow. But you know what’s more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos! People love to gamble, and the spectacular rise of Bitcoin — especially in the age of social media, which tends to hasten trends and encourage bandwagon behavior — has encouraged a set of thrill-seeking speculators to bet big on the currency, hoping to make a quick buck and get out before a crash. This behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren’t keeping pace with inflation, there aren’t many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person. Many Bitcoin buyers aren’t bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10 — in fact, that’s part of the appeal. Real Bitcoin enthusiasts, of course, will say that I’m still missing the point, and that today’s trading mania is just a prelude to an even bigger, more transformational era of cryptocurrency. And while I still have my doubts, I can’t credibly predict that they’re wrong. After all, look what happened the first time.",0.07965384615384614,0.04560462107337108

Here’s what we’re following today: • Carl Icahn has picked another board fight with Xerox • Apple confirmed it has reached a deal to buy Shazam • Elliott Management is demanding that Qualcomm pay a lot more for NXP Semiconductors. • The frenzy over Bitcoin showed no sign of stopping with the introduction of futures tied to the digital currency.  •  Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. The activist investor launched his second campaign to change the management of the copy-machine maker, naming four nominees to Xerox’s board of directors Monday. The move follows the resignation of Jonathan Christodoro, the Icahn-appointed member to Xerox’s board. His decision to step down ended a standstill arrangement between the company and the Icahn Group. The question is whether Mr. Icahn can solve what ails Xerox. Breakingviews’ Lauren Silva Laughlin argues that Xerox has few options to right itself and might do better “realigning itself inside a larger firm, or finding a buyer to take it private.” Apple confirmed Monday that it has reached a deal to buy Shazam, the maker of an app that identifies songs after listening to just a few seconds of them. Apple did not disclose the price tag on the deal, but The New York Times reported Friday that it was expected to be far less than the $1 billion that Shazam was valued at in its most recent fund-raising round in 2015. In 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses. Shazam’s technology was introduced in 2002 as a dial-up service that would listen to a song for 30 seconds and send its user a text message identifying it. It eventually became one of the most popular mobile apps on Apple’s App Store. Last year, the company said that it had surpassed a billion mobile downloads and was used by “hundreds of millions of people each month.” For Apple, the deal is all about Siri, writes VentureBeat’s Emil Protalinski: Paul Pendergass, formerly DealBook’s “Jack Flack” columnist, offers up his unique take on the deal: In arguing that NXP Semiconductors is worth $135 per share — on an independent basis, and therefore leaving aside Qualcomm’s takeover bid — the activist hedge fund is threatening to add more to Broadcom’s hostile acquisition campaign for Qualcomm. Elliott argued in a presentation this morning that the market hasn’t appreciated how much of a revival NXP’s business has enjoyed, particularly now that it has fully processed its acquisition of fellow chip maker Freescale Semiconductor. And Qualcomm’s $110-a-share bid is currently acting as a cap on how much higher the stock can go. From the activist's letter to other shareholders: The bigger picture: Qualcomm has been fighting off Broadcom’s $105 billion takeover offer. But Broadcom said that its current bid is contingent in part on the NXP transaction being completed at the original level of $110 a share. Analysts and investors have speculated that, by paying more for NXP, Qualcomm could effectively persuade Broadcom to walk away — though some also have suggested that Elliott’s move could be a useful way to persuade Broadcom to raise its price. Where things stand: Qualcomm is currently in the middle of a tender offer for NXP shares. A small fraction of NXP shareholders have currently agreed to accept the bid, with many waiting until the end of the offer period. At the moment, the earliest that Qualcomm’s tender could wrap up is middle-to-late January. The Qualcomm response For now, the chip maker said that it disagrees with Elliott’s analysis. Its statement: — Michael J. de la Merced Cboe’s recently introduced futures proved so popular that the Chicago exchange’s website went down amid overwhelming traffic and circuit breakers were triggered — twice.

Mike: Seriously though, this week in Bitcoin news was truly insane. The digital currency shot to more than $17,000 per BTC, up from $12,000 literally just a few days ago. It’s totally nuts. Nathaniel Popper, our trusty colleague, has done a fantastic job chronicling the saga for The Times, if you haven’t read his work this week. It kind of feels like those stories I heard years ago about hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, where people would cart around wheelbarrows of cash that wouldn’t be worth the paper they were printed on. But, uh, I guess the opposite of that. All of this seems completely unsustainable to me. And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can’t even fathom what the price is going to be. Farhad:  I don’t think it’s unsustainable. I’m not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high. Like all network technologies (as well as currencies), Bitcoin gets its utility from the number of people who are committed to it. There are lots of people and technologies around the world now hooked into it, and they are slowly coming up with uses for it, giving it a kind of built-in momentum. In other words, even though it may crash in the short run, I don’t think it’s near its ultimate price. Mike: O.K. — well, basically what I’m asking is, should I start asking The Times to pay me in Bitcoin? Farhad: Wait, you get paid? That sounds like an error of some kind. Mike: I’ll ask H.R. about it next week. I do wonder, though, what it will take to bring Bitcoin truly mainstream. I’m a tech-savvy person, and even I need to read an entire Wikipedia article just to figure out what I’m buying with a Bitcoin and how to spend it. Makes me think there’s not a lot wrong with cash (though many finance wonks would probably disagree with that assessment). Mike: Meanwhile, the reckoning against misbehaving men continues. Right now, we’re in the middle of watching a Silicon Valley battle play out against Shervin Pishevar, an early investor in Uber who has been accused of sexual harassment by several women. Bloomberg did a piece detailing how he brought a pony to an Uber party — yes, really — and later harassed an Uber executive the same evening. Farhad: You skipped the best part of that piece — a defender who argues that Shervin couldn’t possibly have harassed anyone because he was holding the pony’s leash. Mike: Ah, yes. The old “holding the pony leash” defense. I believe Matlock pioneered this approach. Regardless, the claims were furthered on Thursday when Laura Fitton, an entrepreneur, became the first woman to go on the record saying Pishevar crossed the line with her in an encounter years ago. No ponies this time, though Fitton said Pishevar referred to himself repeatedly in the third person as “Shervy,” which is pretty awful even without adding claims of harassment. Anyway, my biggest takeaway from our Harvey Weinstein coverage is that he wasn’t just one guy harassing women. Weinstein exercised amazing power and control over an enormous network to keep his activities secret from the public for years. That required the complicity of hundreds of people to keep him doing what he was doing. I imagine that type of power is hardly confined to the entertainment industry, and we’re seeing the cracks in that facade play out in other areas — including tech. Farhad: Yup. Like in entertainment, much of what happens in the tech world happens through networks of power and proximity. The only way to have long-lasting change in this industry is to replace those old networks with new, more inclusive ones. We may be at the start of that transition now, but there’s going to be a lot of fallout before we get there. Mike: Before we go, I found this report fascinating: Apparently some of the biggest firms in advertising plan to increase their ad buying budget on Amazon between 40 and 100 percent next year, an attempt to move away from the digital advertising duopoly that is Facebook and Google. I’m all for shifting the balance of power away from those two companies, who have managed to decimate the publishing industry in record time. But do we really think Amazon is the place to do it? You probably know better than I, since you just wrote a good piece on Amazon. Farhad: Yeah, it’s a good question. More and more I feel like our future is going to be dominated by battles between these huge corporations. And none of us really has a lot of power in this — advertisers, consumers, we’ve all got these complex decisions to make about which of the giants to go with. We saw another big battle this week: Google once again blocked YouTube on Amazon’s devices, in retaliation, its says, for Amazon refusing to sell Google’s hardware in its store. Pick your side, consumer! Mike: Well, that’s enough chitchat for me today. See you next week! I’ll be over on Reddit, conspiring with my fellow Bitcoin millionaires. Farhad: I’ll be in another part of Reddit, plotting to hack you. See you! Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art. Mike Isaac covers Facebook, Uber and Twitter.

18,Bitcoin’s Price Has Soared. What Comes Next?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/technology/bitcoin-price-rise.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-08T00:19:54+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Bitcoin has been in a bull market like few the world has ever seen. At the beginning of the year, the price of a Bitcoin was below $1,000. It hit $5,000 in October, then doubled by late November. And on Thursday, less than two weeks later, the price of a single Bitcoin rose above $20,000 on some exchanges, according to Coinmarketcap. The latest price spike has been credited to signs that Wall Street companies plan on bringing their financial heft into the market. At the current cost, the value of all Bitcoin in circulation is about $300 billion. To get a sense of how big that is, all the shares of Goldman Sachs are worth about $90 billion. The gains have been driven by several other factors — perhaps the most important being the irrational mentality that can take over in speculative bubbles. But most people buying Bitcoin are doing so in the belief that others will want it even more in the future. The gains, though, have many people, even Bitcoin believers, anticipating a big crash. The fringe communities that drove Bitcoin in its early years are playing a much less important role in the current rally. Many investors have said the most important factor driving the current enthusiasm is the entry of hedge funds and other institutional investors. The path for large investors has been smoothed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange, which have been racing to roll out Bitcoin futures contracts. Most banks are already signed up with these exchanges and consequently can immediately begin trading the contracts. The options exchange has said it plans to start trading on Sunday. It is still unclear how the arrival of Bitcoin futures will influence the demand for the digital tokens. With a futures contract, banks can bet on the price of Bitcoin without holding the underlying Bitcoins. This is expected to bring many new players into the market who don’t want to deal with the complications of holding Bitcoins. But the futures contract will also allow investors to short Bitcoin, or bet on the price’s going down, which has been hard to do until now. Some analysts think this could put downward pressure on the price. Other market participants have worried that Bitcoin futures could spread the risks of Bitcoin into the rest of the financial system. People still use Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to make ransom payments and buy illegal goods online, including synthetic opioids. But that activity has been on the wane since the authorities shut down some of the largest online black markets this year. Individual investors have been just as active as large investors. Nowhere has the phenomenon of ordinary people buying virtual currencies been more visible than in South Korea, where several exchanges have storefronts to help new customers. This is all the more remarkable because just a year ago, Koreans showed almost no interest in these markets. Small Japanese investors have also been investing in Bitcoin. They have been encouraged by laws passed this year that essentially legalized Bitcoin and allowed Bitcoin exchanges to get regulatory licenses. In the United States, most small-time investors have gone to the San Francisco company Coinbase, which provides a Bitcoin brokerage service, similar to Charles Schwab, as well as an exchange for larger investors. Coinbase now has more account holders than Schwab, and it has struggled to keep up with the growth. China used to be the most active country for Bitcoin trading and mining, but the authorities there have cracked down this year. Many of the largest exchanges, including in South Korea, are essentially unregulated. The lack of oversight means that no one is checking that the exchanges are properly securing their customers’ money or that large players are not able to manipulate the price. One of the largest exchanges in the world, Bitfinex, has been hacked numerous times and provides little transparency about where it is keeping its money. Even regulated exchanges, like Coinbase in the United States, have not been battle tested like larger financial institutions, and their operations have gone down at key moments. Once people buy Bitcoin or other virtual currencies, they are often targeted by hackers who have become experts at penetrating Bitcoin accounts. Bitcoin “wallets” are vulnerable to new kinds of attacks that are not a problem for ordinary financial accounts. Most important, in contrast to money in a bank account, when a Bitcoin is gone there is essentially no way to get it back and no insurance covering its loss. When Bitcoin was released in 2009, it was described as a new kind of electronic cash. Recently, though, many programmers working on Bitcoin have said the system in its current form is not a particularly good way to pay for things. They argue that it is best designed to serve as a sort of scarce commodity, like digital gold, allowing people to keep their money outside the control of governments and companies. Many people who want to use virtual currencies for online payments are looking to Bitcoin competitors, like Bitcoin Cash and Monero. Earlier this year, bullish sentiment was focused on Ethereum, a virtual currency network that is more adaptable than Bitcoin. The price of Ether, the virtual currency on the Ethereum network, has continued to rise in recent months, but not as fast as Bitcoin. Many investors were also putting their money into custom virtual currencies released by entrepreneurs in so-called initial coin offerings. These new virtual currencies have generally been designed to serve as the internal payment mechanisms on new software the entrepreneurs are building. This fall, though, regulators have signaled that they are planning to crack down on coin offerings. The Bitcoin software was released in early 2009 by a mysterious creator who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The search is still on for the true identity of Satoshi. The software released by Satoshi set out the basic rules for Bitcoin and the computer network on which it lives. Unlike other forms of money, which are controlled by governments and financial institutions, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers that no one institution controls.

19,Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/coinbase-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-07T00:41:58+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange. The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase.  Coinbase has been at the center of the speculative frenzy driving up the value of Bitcoin — which topped $13,000 on Wednesday — and similar currencies. While there are many Bitcoin exchanges around the world, Coinbase has been the dominant place that ordinary Americans go to buy and sell virtual currency. No company had made it simpler to sign up, link a bank account or debit card, and begin buying Bitcoin. The number of people with Coinbase accounts has gone from 5.5 million in January to 13.3 million at the end of November, according to data from the Altana Digital Currency Fund. In late November, Coinbase was sometimes getting 100,000 new customers a day — leaving the company with more customers than Charles Schwab and E-Trade.  The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase’s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced. Coinbase’s offices in downtown San Francisco show a start-up straining to keep up with growth. The company offers all the usual perks: free lunch and dinner, a sizable cafeteria and a room with yoga mats and board games. Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room.  The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company’s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak — two days earlier — and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently.  [ALSO READ: What is Bitcoin and How Does it Work?] All of the big Bitcoin exchanges went down for at least part of the day, and Coinbase got back online faster than most. Still, any sort of downtime like that would be unacceptable in more traditional exchanges where stocks and commodities are traded.  “There are some well-known places this year when we weren’t able to keep up with the volume,” said Jeremy Henrickson, the chief product officer at Coinbase. “We are not where we need to be yet.”  Most Friday afternoons, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, holds a session in the cafeteria where employees can ask him anything. On the Friday of the record-hitting week, Mr. Armstrong discussed how the company was planning to grow and introduced Asiff Hirji, the new president and chief operating officer who will help him oversee it all.  The addition of Mr. Hirji, who had the same role at TD Ameritrade, was an implicit recognition that this new industry needs more seasoned hands to help young executives like Mr. Armstrong, who is 34. Mr. Hirji will manage Coinbase’s trading operations while Mr. Armstrong focuses on new projects.  Mr. Armstrong has been running Coinbase since he co-founded it in 2012. Soft-spoken and reserved, he is an unusual figure in an industry filled with loud ideologues. He has done few public appearances during Bitcoin’s recent bull market, and he recognizes the current frenzy has come with downsides.  “It’s probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,” Mr. Armstrong said last week. “The thing I’m passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.”  There is some irony to the success that Mr. Armstrong has experienced as a result of Bitcoin’s rising price. In 2015, he helped lead a push to get the Bitcoin network to expand so it could handle more transactions. That effort failed, and Mr. Armstrong said in a recent interview that Bitcoin “did break my heart a little bit.” He said he now holds more of his wealth in a Bitcoin competitor, Ether, which Coinbase also offers to customers.  Most of the screens in the Coinbase offices show the performance of the company’s servers and customer metrics — like the number of customers downloading its iPhone app. For a time last week, Coinbase was among the 10 most downloaded iPhone apps, ahead of Uber and Twitter.  [ALSO READ: What Jamie Dimon is Missing About Bitcoin?] There are a few screens, including one in the cafeteria, that show the price of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether, the three virtual currencies that Coinbase buys, sells and holds for customers. Litecoin was created by a former Coinbase employee and is often described as silver to Bitcoin’s gold. The newer Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, is the second most valuable virtual currency after Bitcoin.  Coinbase set itself apart from other early Bitcoin companies when it was one of the first to get a new, special license for virtual currency companies in New York, called the BitLicense.  In the last year, though, Coinbase’s most notable interaction with the government came after the Internal Revenue Service asked the company to hand over all of its customer records. Bitcoin holders are supposed to pay taxes if they collect gains from selling coins, but the I.R.S. has said that only a few hundred people have done so each year.  Coinbase fought the broad request from the I.R.S. and last week, while the price was skyrocketing, announced an agreement to hand over only the records of customers who made transactions involving more than $20,000 of virtual currencies — around 3 percent of the company’s customers.  In addition to the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange, called GDAX, tailored to larger investors.  GDAX is overseen by Adam White, a former Air Force officer and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The day Bitcoin hit $10,000, he was in New York speaking with big financial institutions that are looking into Bitcoin. Some companies are getting ready to begin trading Bitcoin futures contracts in December, when that activity becomes available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  [ALSO READ: Bitcoin Hasn’t Replaced Cash, but Investors Don’t Care] A year ago, his Wall Street outreach was difficult, but “it’s all inbound now,” Mr. White said.  Not surprisingly, Coinbase is on a building spree. It recently leased office space in New York that will handle the Wall Street business and a new service that holds virtual currencies for large customers. In San Francisco, the company is adding two new floors in the building where it now has one.  Still, the main concern among virtual currency investors is that Coinbase has not expanded fast enough. In May, the company was criticized by a customer who could not reach anyone at the company after his account was hacked.  Coinbase is trying to be more responsive. At the beginning of the year, the company had 24 employees providing customer support. It now has around 180, with most of them outsourced from a call center in Texas and an email response team in the Philippines. The cafeteria is often turned into a “Crypto Club” where new employees are taught the ins and outs of virtual currency.  Daniel Romero, the general manager of Coinbase, said he wanted to have 400 customer support employees by the first quarter of next year to provide phone support around the clock. But in the meantime, there is a 10-day backlog of service requests. “When your customer support issues are that publicly bad, and you have your site go down when people want to be trading,” it’s a very humbling experience, Mr. Romero said.

20,"Bitcoin Hasn’t Replaced Cash, but Investors Don’t Care",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/bitcoin-payments-gold.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-12-06T20:57:17+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Bitcoin first entered the public consciousness a few years back, a handful of large companies like Dell and Expedia announced that they would begin accepting the virtual currency. But there weren’t many takers. This failure hasn’t bothered many of the people buying up Bitcoins in recent months, pushing the price to new highs — above $13,000 for one Bitcoin on Wednesday. These investors aren’t using their tokens to buy computers or to book trips. Instead, they are hoarding Bitcoins as if it were virtual gold, a new way to store money outside the control of any government or company. “I’ve always been skeptical of directly competing with and replacing existing forms of payment,” said Steve Lee, a longtime Google employee from San Francisco who is investing in virtual currencies. “Today what Bitcoin is excellent at, and has mostly solved, is being your own bank.” The argument about what Bitcoin does well and not so well can seem like a semantic debate for computer nerds, with little relevance to the outside world. But disagreements within the Bitcoin community are being watched closely by central bankers and financial industry executives. The titans of finance are monitoring Bitcoin’s successes and failures as they experiment with its technological concepts, like the ledger for recording virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain. Many large institutions have said they hope to integrate blockchain technology into their designs for the world’s future financial infrastructure, and those designs are likely to be influenced by what is learned from Bitcoin. “People are looking at this in part because they see the beginnings of a new financial system — a financial system that has a very different structure than the one we have right now,” said Neha Narula, the director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Lee and others hope Bitcoin can be used for payments someday, but he thinks that will most likely come from software that is built on top of Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin network itself. Not everyone agrees with Mr. Lee’s position. Many entrepreneurs and academics think virtual currencies will gain traction only if they are easy and cheap to send around. The disagreement has given rise to a host of Bitcoin competitors — including a separate virtual currency known as Bitcoin Cash. But the community that has developed around the original Bitcoin has increasingly been united around a vision that is focused on its goldlike qualities, rather than its ability to compete with PayPal or Western Union. “The reason people own Bitcoin is because it’s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,” said Jimmy Song, a developer who has contributed to the Bitcoin software. “You can send money to Africa in 10 minutes, but that’s not the main reason people buy it.” When Bitcoin was introduced in 2008, the title of the paper written by its creator, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, called the currency an “electronic cash system.” The Bitcoin software created a decentralized network of computers that anyone with internet access could join, making it easy to send Bitcoins between addresses. And Bitcoin first gained public notice because of its use as anonymous digital cash on black-market websites like the Silk Road. But the number of people using Bitcoin to buy things was always small compared with the number of speculators buying it because of its scarcity. This was something the original software behind Bitcoin had also encouraged, by setting a limit of 21 million on the number of Bitcoins that would ever be released. The increasing value of Bitcoin made it even less attractive as a way to pay for things. Most people don’t want to pay now with a dollar that could be worth twice as much next week. There are also limits on the Bitcoin system’s capacity. A rule written into the Bitcoin software had established that the network could process only around five transactions per second — compared with the 25,000 transactions handled by Visa each second. This bottleneck led to a fight between people looking to use Bitcoin for different purposes. Many early followers believed the system could expand to handle more transactions without sacrificing its status as a virtual commodity. This camp proposed a change to the Bitcoin rules that would have doubled the capacity of the system in November. But Mr. Lee and other investors and programmers worried that quickly expanding the Bitcoin network would threaten Bitcoin’s independence. “To be a global money, you can’t have one bank or one country controlling the money, or even a handful of countries or banks,” Mr. Lee said. “If decentralization is jeopardized, most things fall apart with Bitcoin.” Decentralization is a result of Bitcoin’s unusual design, which allows users to keep and monitor the records of every single Bitcoin transaction, without any central authority. If the number of transactions quickly increased, many Bitcoin aficionados believed, only large companies would be able to keep the records. What’s more, they believed the design of Bitcoin wasn’t well suited to competing with PayPal and Visa, because every transaction has to be recorded on thousands of computers around the world. “Anyone who looked at Bitcoin and saw ‘cheap payments’ likely doesn’t have much background in computer science,” said Ben Davenport, a co-founder of the virtual currency start-up BitGo and an opponent of doubling the network. This argument prevailed, and in early November the plan to double the network capacity was called off. Since then, people interested in using virtual currencies to make payments have looked to Bitcoin competitors. Stephen Pair, the chief executive of Bitpay, a start-up that helps companies take virtual currency payments, said his customers were looking to move beyond Bitcoin. “If people can’t engage in commerce, it’s hard to imagine why they’d want to store their money in Bitcoin in the first place,” Mr. Pair said. Mr. Pair believes it is irresponsible to suggest that a virtual currency that has been around for less than a decade could pose a credible challenge to gold. The conceit of Bitcoin as a good place to store money, he added, will be less convincing when the price of Bitcoin goes down, as it has in the past. One alternative is Bitcoin Cash, which was created in August. The price of Bitcoin Cash has risen over 125 percent since the plan to double the capacity of the original Bitcoin was called off. But there is no shortage of investors who have voted with their pocketbooks for the more cautious approach of the original Bitcoin. The price of a Bitcoin has jumped 70 percent over the past month, to more than 10 times the price of an ounce of gold. “I don’t think most people treat Bitcoin as something to buy because it’ll get feature X, Y and Z in the future,” Mr. Song said. “Mostly, people are investing because they believe it to be a good store of value.”",0.1606867924528302,0.12959881837240328

After selling his real estate agency near Seoul, he invested in South Korean stocks and then watched them plummet in value after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. He tried to recover, continuing to play the stock market and lotteries, but lost yet more money. Now, at 77 years old, he is hoping he can make it all back in the booming virtual currency markets, which have pushed the price of Bitcoin to new highs above $10,000 and pulled up the price of many alternative digital tokens. Last week, Mr. Choi visited the physical location of one of South Korea’s many new virtual currency exchanges, with a plan to put about a quarter of his remaining $18,000 in savings into virtual currencies. “I may have missed the Bitcoin boat but new boats are coming and I want to hop on those,” he said. “It is possible that some might be scams but even with those, the prices will rise at least in the middle of their life cycles so that there will be a chance to make money from trading them.” Around the world, ordinary people, with no prior experience in virtual currencies, have been lured into the virtual currency markets in recent weeks by the soaring prices of Bitcoin and its competitors. In Japan, small-time speculators have swarmed to Bitcoin since the government there essentially legalized the virtual currency earlier this year and gave licenses to several exchanges. In the United States, the biggest Bitcoin brokerage, Coinbase, gained 300,000 new customers in a week, according to recent research reports.  But nowhere has the public frenzy been more feverish than in South Korea. It was on South Korean exchanges that the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 last Monday, hours before traders in the United States reached the same level of exuberance. And last week, trading between the Korean currency, the won, and Ether, the most valuable Bitcoin competitor, was nearly as active as trading between the dollar and Ether — despite the fact that Korea’s population is one-sixth that of the United States. With some virtual currencies, like Ripple and Bitcoin Cash, the won accounts for more trading than the dollar, according to the site CryptoCompare. These volumes are all the more remarkable because just a year ago virtual currency markets barely existed in Korea, unlike in the United States and China, where virtual currency trading has grown over a number of years. The sudden rise of virtual currency trading has been dramatic enough that the country’s prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, expressed concern last week. “This can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,” he said in a statement after a cabinet meeting. Mr. Lee called on the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to take a closer look. South Korean regulators have already announced a ban on so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies. But the exchanges where existing virtual currencies are traded come under essentially no regulatory oversight in South Korea, unlike in the United States and Japan. Mr. Lee said he was particularly worried about young people who have gotten caught up in the markets. “There are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multilevel marketing for frauds,” he said. Virtual currencies are not the first speculative markets to take off among ordinary investors in South Korea. The country has some of the most active foreign currency markets for small-time investors, allowing people to trade between the won, dollar, euro and smaller currencies. Ha Tae-hyeong, a professor of economics at the University of Suwon, said that South Koreans have been drawn to speculative trading because of the lack of other high-yield investment options. “People were looking for anything that would bring them higher return on investment,” Mr. Ha said. Chung Gong-jin, a 16-year-old high school student, said he had been drawn to Bitcoin because it has gone up so quickly, and doesn’t require the same amount of knowledge as stock investing. “I don’t feel like I have to study so much to invest in Bitcoin — about the market or the economy, for example — that I need to do to invest in stocks,” said Mr. Chung, who lives in a suburb of Seoul. Mr. Chung is part of a 100-person group that meets to talk about investments and attend virtual currency conferences. Even virtual currency enthusiasts in South Korea are concerned about the sudden rush into Bitcoin and Ether. They say investors are often getting in with little grasp of how virtual currencies work, like the decentralized network where all the transaction records are kept, or why they may be valuable over the long term. “I do feel sorry to see so many people being shortsighted about Bitcoin, just trying to predict its price changes over short term to make quick money,” said Kim Joon-young, a 28-year-old who runs a popular virtual currency Facebook group, Plan B. For now, the South Korean Bitcoin exchanges that have sprung up over the past year have done their best to stoke the excitement. Unlike in the United States and Japan, where exchanges are entirely online, a number of South Korean operations have set up store fronts where investors can come to buy in and learn more. Coinone, the second largest exchange in the country, opened a location in September in the financial district of Seoul, Yeouido, with an area for meetings, a help desk and virtual currency ATMs. One day last week, around lunch time, a group of about 35 students from Konyang University were visiting the Coinone office for an introductory class on virtual currency investing. Lee Jeong-min, a 39-year old social worker and author, was there to buy Ripple, a virtual currency that has been popular for cross-border bank transfers. Ms. Lee said she saw some of her conservative friends, including teachers and pharmacists, getting rich on Bitcoin and she didn’t want to miss the next wave. “I realized that I missed a bus, the Bitcoin bus, so that I can’t hop on that bus anymore,” she said. “But I can’t miss the next bus coming, can I?” Ms. Lee said she spent around 300,000 won, or around $275, on 900 Ripple. Mr. Choi, the 77-year-old former real estate agent, was also at Coinone, getting advice from the help desk on how to log in and invest from his home computer. He didn’t trust his cellphone with the transactions. Like Ms. Lee, Mr. Choi felt it was too late to get in on Bitcoin. He is placing his big bet on the Ethereum network, and its Ether currency, which was designed to allow for a wider variety of transactions than Bitcoin. He said he knows he might lose money, but he was holding out hope. “I might die tomorrow. I am an old man,” he said. “But I think that hope keeps people going. Without dreams, there is nothing for a man. Hoping that things would get at least a little better is important.”",0.16916166666666668,0.06084290824915825

The price has been pushed up by a flood of new buyers from around the world who think they have spotted a new kind of investment that could ultimately compete with gold as a place to store money outside the control of companies and governments. These mainstream investors have not just been the libertarian-minded programmers who helped Bitcoin survive its rocky first seven years, after the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto released it in 2009. In recent months, trading among ordinary investors has taken off in South Korea and Japan. Seoul now has multiple storefronts where less technically adept people can buy and sell Bitcoin. It was on Korean exchanges where the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 on Monday. On American exchanges, the price was hovering around $9,700 on Monday. The skyrocketing price has brought forth no shortage of skeptics, from Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to Warren E. Buffett, who have variously called it a fraud, a bubble and a Ponzi scheme. The untethered price increase has, to a degree, proved their point, suggesting that this is an investment tied to few real-world fundamentals. But each time the skeptics have come forward, investors have defied them and bought more Bitcoins at higher prices. On Sunday, more than $5 billion was traded on Bitcoin exchanges, according to the data site Coinmarketcap.com — a greater volume than what many American stock exchanges see on a normal day. Believers in the Bitcoin technology, which is backed by a new kind of computer network, have argued that what we are seeing is the formation of a new asset class that could join stocks, bonds and physical commodities in the investment portfolios of ordinary people. If this is a new digital gold, today’s extraordinary prices still leave the total supply of Bitcoins in the world at a value that is only one-sixtieth of all the real gold in the world. But even aficionados have been dumbstruck by just how quickly the price has gone up in recent months. “While there has been a slew of bullish news for Bitcoin of late, the rapidity of the ascent to $10,000 has taken many of us by surprise,” said Chris Burniske, an investor and a co-author of the book “Cryptoassets.” Or as one trending comment on the Reddit social network put it: “This is officially madness. I am going to prepare myself for a large correction.” Hedge funds have also been clamoring to get a piece of the action. More than 100 hedge funds invest only in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. In many places, this trading is happening on exchanges with little regulatory oversight or transparency. This has given rise to fears that a problem at one of the exchanges could trigger a panicked run on Bitcoin, something that is not unlikely given the relative inexperience of many of the new investors. A steep rise in the price of Bitcoin in late 2013 was punctured when the biggest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox, was discovered not to have the Bitcoins it claimed to have. That led to a three-year lull in the price. But current investors see that after all the previous popped bubbles — and there have been several — the price eventually returned to its old high and then vaulted past it. The price of a Bitcoin is now more than seven times the high it reached in 2013. What’s more, the Bitcoin ecosystem is now more distributed around the world, with less reliance on a single company like Mt. Gox, which collapsed three years ago. While Mt. Gox hosted more than 75 percent of all Bitcoin trading in 2013, the largest exchanges today have only around 10 percent of the business. That should theoretically make the industry less vulnerable to problems at one institution. Bitcoin has been able to flow around the world and reach investors in countries large and small, because of the singular design that was laid out by its creator. Bitcoins are stored and traded on a decentralized network of computers that is not under the control of any government or company. That has been attractive to people in countries, like China and Zimbabwe, where the government has a history of seizing bank accounts and assets. The growing number of people using it in all these countries, often against the wishes of their governments, has also underscored the degree to which the software that manages Bitcoin has remained impervious to hackers and government control for nearly a decade. The recent price increases, though, have meant that Bitcoin is not living up to its promise as a currency routinely used for small purchases. Few people want to spend their Bitcoins if they believe the price will double in the next month. Bitcoin has remained popular as a way to pay for illegal drugs online because of the ability to open a Bitcoin wallet without providing any personal information. But Bitcoin has faced competition on this front from virtual currencies that provide more privacy. And the overall black market trade has diminished this year after the authorities took down some of the largest black market websites in the summer. This has been welcome news for many Bitcoin backers who want to see it lose its shadowy associations. Many Bitcoin investors have also come to believe that the Bitcoin network is not particularly well suited to handle lots of little transactions. These investors frequently argue that what Bitcoin is designed to do well is store money securely and outside the control of any company or government that could seize it, like a more transportable version of gold. “The reason people own Bitcoin is because it’s a great store of value, possibly the greatest that has ever existed,” said Jimmy Song, a programmer who works on the Bitcoin software. The last few years have brought a proliferation of virtual currencies that aim to compete with Bitcoin, sometimes with the goal of handling transactions more cheaply and quickly. This year, it appeared that the most popular virtual currency network other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, might pass Bitcoin in value. At the time, Bitcoin was hobbled by an internal battle over how to update the software and expand the network. In October, though, one side gave up the fight, and since then the price of Bitcoin has shot up, sometimes rising more in a week than it rose in its first seven years. In recent weeks, Bitcoin isn’t the only virtual currency that has been moving up. Ether, which lives on the Ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash, another Bitcoin competitor, have also been rising quickly in value as investors look for anything that might have the same durability and upward mobility as the original.",0.036834545454545446,0.123221336744064
23,Initial Coin Offerings Horrify a Former S.E.C. Regulator,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/26/business/initial-coin-offering-critic.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-26T20:03:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s staff have been hearing recently from a former colleague with an urgent question: Why aren’t you cracking down on these initial coin offerings? Initial coin offerings are a relatively new method that entrepreneurs have used to raise money for start-ups, by selling custom-built virtual currencies. The practice has taken off this year, despite the warnings of regulators and the uncertainty of the rules concerning the fund-raising method. Joseph Grundfest, who was a commissioner at the S.E.C. in the 1980s and is now a law and business professor at Stanford, said he had been contacting current commission officials and staff to urge them to bring cases, and fast. “I.C.O.s represent the most pervasive, open and notorious violation of federal securities laws since the Code of Hammurabi,” Mr. Grundfest said in an interview. “It’s more than the extent of the violation,” he said. “It’s the almost comedic quality of the violation.” A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment. Start-ups have raised more than $3 billion this year from investors through coin offerings. Most start-ups say the coins they are selling will be useful as a method of payment in the online services they are building. Coin offerings generally happen without the involvement of financial institutions or regulators because investors pay for the coins using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which can be sent outside the traditional financial system. Regulators in China and South Korea have recently banned such offerings outright. In the United States, the S.E.C. has brought one case against a small fraudulent coin offering. The agency has also warned that at least some coins being sold could be considered securities, and would be in violation of securities law if not registered with the authorities — and few are. But Mr. Grundfest, who is also a co-director of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance, said the continuing flow of new coin offerings showed that the warnings were not nearly enough. “We’re waiting to see a whole bunch of enforcement actions in this space, and we wonder why they haven’t happened yet,” he said. “I hope what they are doing is planning on a sweep of 50 I.C.O.s.” Mr. Grundfest is far from the only voice who has criticized the frenzy around coin offerings. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who has expressed enthusiasm about Bitcoin, has said he thinks that “99 percent of I.C.O.s are a scam,” a sentiment that other leading venture capitalists have echoed. But Mr. Grundfest’s words could carry more weight, both because he is close to the technology world near Stanford and because he knows what it takes to bring federal securities cases. He said the most obvious way for regulators to go after initial coin offerings would be to label them as securities and punish them for not registering with the authorities. The chairman of the S.E.C., Jay Clayton, said in a talk this month that the agency was planning to crack down on offerings that violated securities law, including virtual coins that should be categorized as securities but have not been registered with the authorities. “Where we see fraud, and where we see people engaging in offerings that are not registered, we are going to pursue them because these types of things have a destabilizing effect on the market,” Mr. Clayton said in a meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Grundfest said that he would welcome this, but that he did not think it should have taken this long. “These are not hard cases,” he said. “You don’t need teams of accountants poring over complex financing documents.” Many companies offering coins have argued that they are not securities because they will have utility on the networks the companies are building. But Mr. Grundfest said it was clear that almost everyone buying tokens at this point was buying them with the hope that their value would go up, not because the buyer wanted to use them on some future computer network. Mr. Grundfest said he thought that the concept of a coin offering could be a useful innovation for certain types of fund-raising. It could, he said, make sense for a company building a decentralized cloud storage network, which could then use the coin as a means of payment and record keeping on the network. But he said almost none of the projects currently raising money through coin offerings had a need for the novel structure. “Is this amazing technology? Yes,” he said. “But most of the stuff we see today is total crap.” Mr. Grundfest said several teams looking at doing offerings had approached him to ask how to do it right. “I say, ‘Look, you are at very high risk for violating the securities law,’ and explain why,” he said. “Then they go find another lawyer.”",0.023141860465116283,0.09290000783024038
24,How Bitcoin Could Help Iran Undermine U.S. Sanctions,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/world/middleeast/bitcoin-iran-sanctions.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-01-29,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"TEHRAN — Stepping from a car into a muddy industrial site in the Iranian desert, a 22-year-old European Bitcoin investor raised his voice to be heard over the roar of a gas-fired generator. His Iranian counterparts — a bespectacled information-technology specialist, a self-described ‘‘hard-core Bitcoiner’’ and the businessman running the site — walked their foreign visitor over to gray shipping containers containing thousands of small computers. When completed and connected to the power grid, the computers would help process a cryptocurrency that, in theory at least, could enable Iran to evade United States sanctions. The value of Bitcoin, the dominant online currency in the world, is treacherously unpredictable. But it is an emerging front in the economic war between Washington and Tehran. Iran’s economy has been hobbled by banking sanctions that effectively stop foreign companies from doing business in the country. But transactions in Bitcoin, difficult to trace, could allow Iranians to make international payments while bypassing the American restrictions on banks. In the past, the threat of United States sanctions has been enough to squelch most business with Iran, but the anonymous payments made in Bitcoin could change that. While Washington could still monitor and intimidate major companies, countless small and midsize companies could exploit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to conduct business under American radar. The United States Treasury, well aware of the threat, is attempting to bring Bitcoin and the others into line. In recent weeks, in response to an internet fraud case originating from Iran, the Treasury imposed sanctions on two Iranians and the Bitcoin addresses, or ‘‘wallets,’’ they had used for trading in the currency. The Treasury also has warned digital marketplaces that buy and sell Bitcoin and companies that sell computers used to process Bitcoin transactions that they should not provide services to Iranians. Several well-known trading sites are now blocking buyers and sellers from Iran. Some have confiscated money belonging to clients based in Iran. “Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies,” the department said in a statement. But by their nature, cryptocurrencies are uncontrolled by any person or entity. At best, efforts to regulate or monitor trade in them are episodic, whack-a-mole affairs. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is simply no way to duplicate the banking sanctions that have proved so damaging to the Iranian economy. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a digital ledger or database known as the blockchain, maintained communally by many independent computers. The system is designed explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Like emails delivered without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records enables the movement of money without going through any central authority. The Iranian government has been slow to recognize the potential sanctions-evading possibilities of Bitcoin. But it is now considering the establishment of exchanges to facilitate trading, one official, Abdolhassan Firouzabadi, said recently. Despite the failure of Venezuela’s state-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, Iran’s central bank said recently that it was seriously considering creation of something similar, possibly called the Crypto-Rial, named after the national currency, the rial. Still, Iran’s venture into Bitcoin pales in comparison to what has been happening the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where thousands of people have jumped into the cryptocurrency business. At the computerized processing operation in the Iranian desert, no one seemed particularly concerned with the geopolitical implications of Bitcoin. The operation consisted of 2,800 computers from China, fitted into eight containers, which when linked are called a farm. It makes intense mathematical calculations, known as mining, needed to confirm Bitcoin transactions. Miners collect fees in Bitcoin for their services. Ignoring the rain, the European visitor used the calculator on his mobile phone to determine how much money could be made from this particular farm, multiplying computer power and deducting electricity and operational costs. He estimated about five Bitcoins a month, which at roughly $4,000 per Bitcoin at current price levels, would be about $20,000. “Not too bad,” he said. The currency fluctuates like any other, though it has proved particularly volatile, sinking to slightly less than $4,000 a unit from nearly $20,000 about a year ago. “We’ll have two engineers on site to keep everything running, that’s it,” said Behzad, the chief executive of IranAsic, the company running the site. He, like the European investor, did not want to provide his family name, out of fear of penalties from the United States. The Chinese computers, called Antminer V9s, were regarded as outdated by the European visitor. Still, he said, “I guess this is the last place on earth where they are still profitable.” That helps explain why Iran seems to be taking its first baby steps toward becoming a global center for mining Bitcoins. Because of generous government subsidies, electricity — the energy for the computers needed to process cryptocurrency transactions — costs little in Iran. It goes for about six-tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour, compared with an average of 12 cents in the United States and 35 cents in Germany. In recent months, dozens of foreign investors from Europe, Russia and Asia have considered moving their mining operations to Iran and other low-cost countries like Georgia. “We have to be flexible in this industry and go where prices are the lowest in order to survive,” said the European investor. Along on the inspection tour was a self-described ‘‘hard-core Bitcoiner,’’ Ziya Sadr, a bearded 25-year old with a beanie and a backpack full of hard drives and USB keys containing his personal stash of the currency. “It helps me to pay to outsource jobs, or allows foreign companies to pay me,” he said. Mr. Sadr said he was currently engineering website products for foreign clients and getting paid in Bitcoin. “These are not huge projects,” he said, “but had it not been for Bitcoin, I wouldn’t have been able get the contracts and get paid here in Iran.” Had Mr. Sadr tried any of these transactions through conventional financial institutions, his account would likely have been blocked. While Mr. Sadr’s transactions are small, some larger companies are starting to use Bitcoin to make payments and circumvent the sanctions. Europeans and Asian counterparts are increasingly cooperative, as their governments opposed the Trump administration’s decision to renounce the nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions. “There is no other way for us, Bitcoin cannot be sanctioned by anyone” said Mr. Sadr, who has discussed Bitcoin with Iranian government officials. “Not by the U.S. government or any other government or other financial entities.” Not quite. As its recent sanctioning of two digital currency addresses, or wallets, and their two Iranian owners showed, the United States Treasury can disrupt cryptocurrency trades, even if only a minuscule fraction of the total. New anonymous wallets can be created for free within minutes. The Treasury’s move came after the Justice Department had indicted two other Iranians on charges of having used ‘‘Samsam’’ ransomware in a sophisticated scheme of attacks on American hospitals, government agencies and the city of Atlanta. The two men, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, are now wanted by the F.B.I. and are thought to be hiding in Iran. During the attack on Atlanta, one of the most serious cyberattacks against a major American city, the pair broke into its computer systems and held the data hostage, eventually ransoming it for about $51,000 worth of Bitcoin. They made around $6 million in Bitcoin from the attacks, prosecutors said. When the hackers wanted to exchange their Bitcoin for Iranian rials they contacted two local traders through WhatsApp. The traders, Ali Khorashadizadeh, 29, and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, 31, exchanged some into rials. When on Nov. 28 a friend told Mr. Ghorbaniyan his name was in the news, he thought it was a mistake. He discovered that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control had placed him and Mr. Khorashadizadeh under sanctions, as well as the Bitcoin addresses they had used. Those addresses had been linked to their websites, making their names traceable. “Please let it be known that, like every trader or bank, I have no knowledge how my clients get their money,” Mr. Ghorbaniyan said. “I just trade. I’m not a hacker. I have nothing to do with those guys.” By the next week, however, Mr. Ghorbaniyan was back in business, using a new — this time anonymous — Bitcoin address he created in five minutes. “Perhaps my name remains sanctioned, but we don’t use names online,” he said. Mr. Ghorbaniyan said his only mistake had been making his Bitcoin address public. “Basically, Treasury just Googled me,” he said. “I’m not making the same mistake again.”",0.01056375,0.0029153589466089464

Trian Fund Management accused Procter & Gamble of wasting shareholder money contesting a tally that showed Mr. Peltz narrowly winning a board seat. We continue to watch the fallout from the Federal Communications Commissions’s decision to dismantle net neutrality rules. (Want this in your own email inbox each morning? Here’s the sign-up.) • F.T.C. is “evaluating the serious issues raised” in Uber’s hack. • Trian is pushing back against P&G’s review of its shareholder vote. • The Republican tax proposals aren’t winning much support from economists. • The F.C.C.’s decision pits Google and Netflix against Comcast and Verizon again. • Has AT&T had a bad week, or a good one? Tuesday Uber disclosed that hackers had stolen information from 57 million driver and rider accounts and that the company had kept the data breach secret for more than a year after paying a $100,000 ransom. The F.T.C. is not the only regulator looking at how Uber handled the breach. Recode reports that attorneys general in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut each said they would investigate. Uber has experienced breaches before. The company was hit with a data breach in May 2014, an event Uber discovered later that year and disclosed in February 2015. In that attack, the names and driver’s licenses of more than 50,000 of the company’s drivers were compromised. In August, Uber agreed to two decades of privacy and security audits to settle accusations from the F.T.C that the company did not keep promises to protect customer data. The largest and most expensive corporate proxy battle in history is getting even more contested, as Procter & Gamble reviews a preliminary tally of shareholder votes that showed a narrow win for activist investor Nelson Peltz. Mr. Peltz’s investment firm, Trian Fund Management, expressed its disappointment on Wednesday that Procter & Gamble is waiting to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looks into election results from independent election inspector IVS Associates. Last week, Trian said that Mr. Peltz had won a seat on Procter & Gamble’s board by a slim margin of 42,780 shares, or about 0.0016 percent of the shares outstanding. In a statement on Wednesday, Trian estimated that Procter & Gamble, which owns brands such as Tide and Gillette, has already spent $100 million defending itself since Mr. Peltz began his bid in July. “P.&G. shareholders should be concerned that P.&G. has opted to waste further time and shareholder money contesting the official tabulation of the independent inspector,” Trian said. “The review and challenge process will be a continued distraction at a time when management and the Board should be focused on improving business results and regaining lost market share.” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble, said the company has “not issued a challenge to the results” and is “still firmly in the review period.” “Our objective has not changed, and that is to ensure that every vote is counted and counted accurately, nothing more, nothing less,” he said. — Tiffany Hsu The Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business asked 42 economists to agree or disagree with this statement: Only one of the respondents agreed. Twenty-two, or 52 percent, disagree or disagreed strongly, while 15 were uncertain. (The rest did not respond.) Also, nearly every economist who responded to the survey agreed or strongly agreed that the tax proposals would leave the United States with a significantly higher debt load. Only one economist was uncertain. Add these academics to the list of Wall Street economists and Washington think tanks that have criticized the tax cuts, writes the Washington Post’s Tory Newmyer. In choosing to dismantle net neutrality regulations, the F.C.C. chairman Ajit Pai has pleased traditional broadband providers who want to charge for some kinds of internet traffic while angering online tech giants who want all internet services to be treated equally. Expect the court battles to begin soon. Here’s how Mr. Pai described his thinking: (Here’s the NYT explainer on what the rule change might mean.) Verizon’s statement: “We continue to believe that users should be able to access the internet when, where, and how they choose.” Facebook’s statement: “We are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone.” Extra credit: The F.C.C.’s next fight will be with states that seek to impose net neutrality on a more local level, Politico reports. Critics corner • Devin Coldewey notes that millions of comments opposing a rollback of net neutrality rules were posted to the F.C.C.’s website. “For someone who claims to be working for the American people, F.C.C. Chairman Ajit Pai sure doesn’t seem to care what they have to say.” (TechCrunch) • Shira Ovide writes, “No matter what the FCC does, America’s internet is not an equal place and it’s only going to become less fair.” (Bloomberg Gadfly) On the bad side: The Justice Department sued to block its $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. And President Trump once again weighed in on that transaction, saying, “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up.” On the good side: The F.C.C.’s net neutrality move. Also, potentially, Mr. Trump’s comments, which keep alive the question of whether the Justice lawsuit was politically motivated. And the case now has a judge — the man who approved Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal, a deal very similar to AT&T’s. Spencer Kurn of New Street Research described the apparent contradiction of the government’s actions: Or as Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews put it, “The Trump administration and tight coordination of policy are hardly synonymous, so it’s not surprising that watchdogs are roaming all over the field.” Legal experts are split on the strength of the government’s case although many acknowledge that the Justice Department will have a hard time battling previous case law involving “vertical” mergers. Extra credit: Bloomberg points out that Time Warner’s top five executives are set to receive as much as $216 million if the deal with AT&T goes through. Two prominent merger advisers told Michael and Andrew that while the conditions and needs behind a surge in deal making are still there, the Justice Department’s move has given pause to many. Blair Effron, Centerview Partners: “Is it idiosyncratic, or a different perspective on what the regulatory framework to going to be? We don’t know yet.” Aryeh Bourkoff, LionTree: “This event does not eliminate the need for transformational events or scale in these industries. However, it has created a heightened level of uncertainty in the deal environment.” And Rich Greenfield of the research firm BTIG told CNN that media M. & A. is delayed for now: “Nobody knows the rules of the road.” • John Lasseter, who helped found Pixar and was one of the Walt Disney Company’s most important executives, will take a leave after unspecified “missteps” that made staff feel “disrespected or uncomfortable.” (NYT) • Charlie Rose was officially fired by CBS and dropped by PBS.

(New Yorker) Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who helped torpedo Congress’ previous efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, may accept the Senate tax legislation’s elimination of a key part of the A.C.A. “Eliminating this tax would allow Alaskans to have greater control over their money and health care decisions,” she wrote in The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Ms. Murkowski signaled that she might back the tax plan if it passed alongside legislation that shores up state health insurance exchanges. But there are still a handful of Republican senators on the fence about the Senate’s tax proposal — and three of them voting no would kill the legislation. The tax flyaround • The real estate industry is worried about the tax bill making homeownership less valuable and has been calling legislators, warning clients about future tax bills and staging protests. (NYT) • An argument that the House bill, which removes tax breaks for graduate students, could undermine research in STEM fields. (Recode) And it’s another headache for his successor, Dara Khosrowshahi. To recap: Last year, hackers stole data on Uber drivers and customers, then demanded $100,000 ransom. The company paid off the hackers, who signed nondisclosure agreements, and then covered up the payments by disguising them as “bug bounties.” “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in a company blog post about the incident, which emerged during a board review. The incidents didn’t happen under Mr. Khosrowshahi’s tenure, and Uber has already dismissed its chief security officer. But it raises yet more questions about what went on while Mr. Kalanick was C.E.O. — a pertinent issue as the company prepares to go public in the next few years. A reminder: Mr. Kalanick is still on the board. This time, it involves words used by the activist hedge fund manager to an African-American aide of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s. From Shane Goldmacher of the NYT: Mr. Loeb told the NYT that his comments weren’t aimed at Mr. Buery but at “the broad institutional failing by our government to confront a broken educational system.” (The financier is the chairman of Success Academy, a network of charter schools.) It isn’t the first time Mr. Loeb has gotten into trouble for loaded language. An important question: How much damage do these controversies do to Mr. Loeb’s much-cherished issue, charter schools? “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day,” the JPMorgan Chase C.E.O. once said of the digital currency. Now his firm’s clients may be able to do just that: the bank is considering providing clients access to CME’s new Bitcoin product through its futures brokerage unit, according to the WSJ. As David Fickling at Bloomberg Gadfly writes: Behind the veil: As Bitcoin goes more mainstream — you can buy Bitcoin on Square — the NYT looks at Bitfinex, the opaque exchange that has had legal troubles and has been hacked twice. She announced plans to retire as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s C.E.O. yesterday, saying, “I’ve been working straight for 35 years.” Remember that she almost had another gig — C.E.O. of Uber — until she overplayed her hand in negotiations with the ride-hailing company.

26,Warning Signs About Another Giant Bitcoin Exchange,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-21T23:55:53+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — As the price of Bitcoin has soared, the virtual currency has edged toward the mainstream. Square, the fast-growing payments company run by the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has begun selling Bitcoins to ordinary consumers, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will soon allow banks to trade on the value of Bitcoin. But if you want to see where the price of Bitcoin is actually determined in round-the-clock bidding, you have to go to a number of unregulated exchanges that often fly in the face of American and European laws. These days, no exchange is bigger than Bitfinex, an opaque operation that provides no information on its website about where it is or who operates the company. Bitfinex, which is officially incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, has been fined by regulators in the United States and cut off by American banks, and it has lost millions of dollars of customer money in two separate hackings, leading critics to question whether it even has the money it claims to hold. In the latest blow, on Tuesday, an alternative virtual currency that is owned and operated by the same people as Bitfinex, known as Tether, announced that it had been hacked and lost around $30 million worth of digital tokens. None of that has been enough to stop customers from pumping billions of dollars worth of virtual currency trades through Bitfinex in recent weeks — on some days, the exchange claimed to be doing more trades, by dollar value, than some stock exchanges in the United States. Even many people who believe in virtual currencies worry that the mixture of loose controls and booming trading at the world’s largest exchange is likely to cause trouble for all the investors piling into virtual currencies, even those who don’t go near Bitfinex. “I’m worried about the systemic risk that this centralized company poses, and I’m worried that if they go down, they will take down the space with them,” said Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, who has a track record of successfully predicting problems in the growing virtual currency industry. The chief executive of Bitfinex and Tether, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, said in an email on Tuesday that “the financial position of the company has never been stronger.” Concerns over virtual currency exchanges are nothing new. The first and largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed in 2014 after losing $500 million of customer money to hackers. This year, law enforcement took down another large Bitcoin exchange, BTC-E, which was accused of being a way station for many of the Bitcoin flowing through online black markets and ransomware attacks. Regulators in the United States and a few other countries have tried to tame the business, and the largest exchanges in the United States and Japan are now under official oversight. Those regulated exchanges, though, are dwarfed by unregulated ones like Bitfinex and several that have popped up in South Korea, where regulators have been slow to act. The liquid nature of the Bitcoin markets, flowing around national borders and laws, is a product of the virtual currency’s unusual structure. Bitcoin is stored and moved through a decentralized network of computers that are not under the control of any single company or government. This structure means that the virtual currency continues to be an easy target for people who want to manipulate its price or use it to launder money. “Unregulated, unregistered exchanges are a very big concern for the industry and the community broadly,” said Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor who is on the board of the American virtual currency company Coinbase. The most frequent face of Bitfinex is its chief strategy officer, Phil Potter. Mr. Potter worked for Morgan Stanley in New York in the 1990s but lost his job after bragging at length in The New York Times about his $3,500 Rolex, his opulent lifestyle and his aggressive tactics for making money. Mr. Potter, 45, runs Bitfinex alongside Mr. Van der Velde, a Dutch-speaking man living in Hong Kong, and Giancarlo Devasini, an Italian man who lives on the French Riviera, according to company filings in Hong Kong. The company lost 1,500 Bitcoin, worth around $400,000, to a hacker in 2015. But the most damaging incident happened in August 2016 when a thief got almost 120,000 Bitcoin, worth around $75 million at the time. The company spread out the losses to all customers — even those who were not holding Bitcoin at the time of the hacking — by forcing customers to take a 36 percent haircut or loss on any money at the exchange. The lack of detail that Bitfinex provided about the hacking drove away some large customers like Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex, a Hong Kong-based virtual currency exchange. “There are so many questions about them,” Mr. Hayes said. “All of this could be easily rectified by just showing all the figures.” Mr. van der Velde said the company had “been as public and transparent as possible about the security incident in August 2016 given the ongoing criminal investigations.” Banks have also been put off by Bitfinex’s operations. Wells Fargo said this year that it would no longer move money from Bitfinex accounts. Shortly after, Bitfinex said its main banks in Taiwan were shutting it off. Since then, it has moved between a series of banks in other countries, without telling customers where the exchange’s money is stored. But nothing has drawn more criticism than the operation of Tether, a virtual currency that is supposed to be tied — or tethered — to the value of a dollar. Customers can buy Tether coins on Bitfinex and then transfer them to other virtual currency exchanges, providing a way to move dollars between countries without going through banks. Tether has also become a very popular way to buy Bitcoin. In recent weeks, a few hundred millions dollars’ worth of Tether has changed hands on a daily basis across several exchanges, according to data on CoinMarketCap.com. Tether and Bitfinex have insisted that the two operations are separate. But leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers, which were made public this month, show that Appleby, an offshore law firm, helped Mr. Potter and Mr. Devasini, the Bitfinex operators, set up Tether in the British Virgin Islands in late 2014. One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up. Tether and Bitfinex have countered this criticism in statements on the companies’ websites and promised that every Tether is backed up by a dollar sitting in a bank account. In September, the companies provided an accounting document intended to prove that Tether is financed with real money. Lewis Cohen, a lawyer at the law firm Hogan Lovells who advises many virtual currency projects, said the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, did not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars. Even if they are, he said, Tether and Bitfinex appear to be violating laws in the United States and Europe that govern investments like Tether, which has qualities very similar to a money market mutual fund. “There are a long list of reasons that you don’t want to deal with them,” Mr. Cohen said of Tether. On Tuesday, Tether announced that an “external attacker” had taken $30 million worth of Tether from the company’s online wallets. The company said it was working to recover the coins.",-0.03374905660377358,0.08801382885109302
27,Mike and Nathaniel’s Week in Tech: Everybody Loves Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/technology/mike-and-nathaniels-week-in-tech-everybody-loves-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-17T14:00:08+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad is off this week, so Nathaniel Popper, a Times tech and finance reporter, is filling in for him. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Mike: Why, hello there, new newsletter partner! It’s everyone’s favorite Bitcoin reporter, Nathaniel Popper! Thanks so much for subbing in for Farhad this week, sir, while he’s off doing whatever it is he does when he’s not being wrong about technology in this newsletter. Nathaniel: It’s good to be here to share some of my own wrong thoughts, Mike. I’ll see if I can do my best Farhad imitation, but with the added bonus of lots of tangents about Bitcoin and fintech. Mike: Indeed. Well, it’s nice to have a finance expert join the tech pod and tell us all the ways that technology is changing how we bank and pay for things and all that stuff I barely comprehend. Mike: Anyway, let’s get on to talking about the week in tech! And with that, why don’t we start off with Bitcoin? Square, the micropayments processing company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, recently started letting a small subset of users purchase Bitcoin using one of the company’s consumer-facing apps, Square Cash. It’s primarily a peer-to-peer money transfer service, but Square is dabbling in ways to make money from the app. Now, you’ve written a bit about Square over the past year, including how the company was set to surge past the market cap of Twitter, Dorsey’s other beloved company. What should I make of this move? Is it something significant for the business or, alternately, is it a significant moment for Bitcoin? With all the daily vacillations in Bitcoin value, it’s hard for me to know if the currency is in a stable, real place with normal people or if it’s still a flight of fancy. Nathaniel: Square’s stock jumped after this Bitcoin news got out. It reminds me a bit of the British company that saw its shares jump 400 percent last month after it simply added the word “blockchain” to its name. (For those tech readers who have successfully ignored all of this craziness, blockchain is the database technology that Bitcoin introduced.) It seems hard to dispute that this is a very bubble-y moment for Bitcoin and all the blockchain and virtual currency stuff that have spun off it. A lot of the people buying right now probably don’t have a terribly strong thesis about why the technology matters — they just see it going up and want to get in on the action. Bitcoin’s position as a new kind of global online gambling parlor has been particularly apparent in South Korea and Japan, which have risen out of nowhere over the last six months to become the largest markets for virtual currency trading. When I was asking around about this a few weeks back, I kept hearing how virtual currency trading fit neatly in countries where ordinary people have long speculated on foreign currencies. It’s worth keeping this in mind for anyone thinking of buying a Bitcoin through Square Cash. Even the speculation, though, points to one of the things that has gotten real technology people so excited about Bitcoin. Here is a new kind of digital investment that anyone in the world can access and buy and that can cross global borders without needing to go through banks. Jack Dorsey hasn’t hidden his interest in this. Back in August, he used an event at the Computer History Museum to reveal his fascination with Bitcoin and the blockchain and his belief that it’s going to lead to some fundamental changes in how money works. I would bet that this trial on Square Cash is just the first baby steps in some bigger moves the company has planned. Mike: I should probably try to find that random Bitcoin I purchased a few years ago on a whim. If only I remembered where I put that wallet. Mike: Moving on, let’s head over to the world of Twitter, everybody’s favorite dysfunctional social network. First, it spent a brutal week testifying in front of Congress about how Russians used social media to influence the 2016 presidential election. Then, a rogue employee decided to delete President Trump’s account for 10 minutes, sending the internet into a fit. Now, Twitter is making some changes to its verification program. You know that little blue badge that some people have on Twitter, signifying that they have been “verified” to be who they say they are? Well, Twitter thinks it needs an overhaul. The badge had become something of a status symbol. But then people started pointing out that avowed white supremacists had become verified, and people argued that Twitter was giving a tacit seal of approval to racist speech or the people behind it. This week, the company rescinded some of the badges to people it said “break the company’s rules,” though Twitter didn’t go into detail. Now, some prominent white supremacists are up in arms about being targeted on the service. I imagine they’ll have another few days of furor over this one. The company says it is also rethinking how verification should work in the future. I always thought being verified was sort of silly, even though I admit I have a little blue badge as well. It seems like the whole program really isn’t worth the headache to me. Nathaniel: It really seems like a bit of a no-win situation for Twitter to me — like so many of the battles around the social media sites these days. For much of the last year, they’ve been getting in trouble for not doing enough to stop bot accounts and fake news. Then they have this one program where they are actually trying to verify things, and that gets them in trouble as well. Didn’t Facebook confront something similar when they took on the fake news problem by adding human editors to their news feed? For Twitter, though, I have to imagine that part of the problem comes from how unevenly it applied those blue badges. You are a New York Times reporter with a badge; I am one without. I can appreciate why you have one, with your vast following and groupies — but the whole thing does feel a bit haphazard and unevenly applied. It does seem like you’d want some sort of guidelines around how the system works. The whole thing made me think that if I were Jack Dorsey, I’d want to leave my job at Twitter and just go sell Bitcoin at Square. What a headache. And only the latest of many for Twitter. Mike: Indeed. Though on a positive note, Twitter is trying to ramp up its data business, an area of the company’s revenue that historically hasn’t gotten much attention. Perhaps they’ll be in luck for this one. Anyway, thanks for coming on and making me smarter about fintech and Twitter! Please come back any time, especially when I start buying large quantities of Dogecoin. Nathaniel: I’ll only come back if you promise you won’t do that.

28,Bitcoin Expansion Is Off the Table. At Least for Now.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/technology/bitcoin-expansion-called-off.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-08T22:17:07+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — A long-running civil war over the design of Bitcoin appears to be over for now, after one side in the fight acknowledged on Wednesday that it had not won sufficient support from other virtual currency backers. The camp that conceded had been hoping to double the number of transactions that could be run through the network that supports Bitcoin, in order to keep transactions cheap and fast. This expansion was vociferously opposed by many of the programmers working on the Bitcoin project, who worried that expanding the network quickly would make it easier for a company or government to exert influence over the decentralized system. The group pushing for expansion had planned to switch to a new version of the Bitcoin software next week, which would have created a split in the network and most likely wreaked havoc on the virtual currency. This planned split, though, was called off on Wednesday, after the companies proposing it failed to win significant support from the Bitcoin community. In an email, the leaders of several of the largest Bitcoin companies said that “unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time.” The price of Bitcoin shot up immediately after the email went out, hitting a new high, above $7,800, before retreating. The price has been steadily climbing and is up nearly 1,000 percent over the last year. The rising price has attracted many new users, from places like Japan and South Korea and from big hedge funds, even as the authorities in places like China have cracked down on the currency. All of the new people seeking access to Bitcoin have run up against a limit on the number of transactions that can flow through the system every 10 minutes, which was put in place during Bitcoin’s early years. Because of the limit, the network can process only around five transactions a second. That has led to delays on the network and has pushed up the price of getting a Bitcoin transaction through. Companies that help process Bitcoin payments have been pushing to lift the limit on Bitcoin transactions for several years, arguing that it will be necessary if Bitcoin wants to compete with Visa or PayPal. The opposing camp has argued that quickly expanding the number of transactions flowing through the network would mean only large companies could track Bitcoin transactions, taking power away from individual users. The proponents of keeping the so-called blocks of Bitcoin transactions small said Bitcoin should be viewed more as digital gold: a secure place to keep money, even if it can’t be moved around as quickly and cheaply. Many of the programmers working on the basic Bitcoin software — the so-called core developers — said they would stop working on Bitcoin if the block size was increased. They also complained that the companies pushing through the block size increase were doing so without properly consulting the community. Leaders on both sides of the Bitcoin debate have complained about receiving death threats and hacking attacks, and some top developers have migrated toward other virtual currencies. In August, some of the most outspoken proponents of expanding Bitcoin created their own version, known as Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions than traditional Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin Cash has gone up since August, but it remains only a small fraction of the size of Bitcoin. On Wednesday, the companies that had been pushing for big blocks said they were calling off their plans in order to restore some measure of peace to the community. “Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together,” the email said. The announcement said that the companies still believed that an increase in the size of Bitcoin blocks would be necessary, but that they were willing to wait until the community agreed on a way to deal with the issue. The people opposed to quickly expanding the network say they still wanted to make it easier and cheaper to use Bitcoin. But they hope this will be made possible by new networks built on top of Bitcoin, keeping the Bitcoin network itself more secure and decentralized.",0.06959166666666665,0.13222447691197692
29,Hedge Funds Push the Price of Bitcoin to New Highs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/technology/bitcoin-hedge-funds.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-06T21:05:43+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has called Bitcoin a fraud and made it clear that he will not allow his bank to begin trading the virtual currency any time soon. But that has not stopped a growing wave of big Wall Street investors — many of them hedge funds — from pouring their money into Bitcoin, helping extend an eight-month spike in its price. The price of a single Bitcoin climbed from below $6,000 two weeks ago to above $7,400 on Monday, more than it moved in the virtual currency’s first seven years in existence. Since the beginning of the year, the value of Bitcoin has jumped over 600 percent, putting the combined value of all Bitcoin at about $120 billion, or more than many of the largest banks in the world. The rise has been fueled by several factors, including the sudden interest in virtual currencies from small investors in Japan and South Korea. Now market watchers say a significant amount of the new money is coming from large institutional investors, many of them hedge funds looking to capitalize on the skyrocketing price. Many of the hedge funds were set up over the last year to invest exclusively in virtual currencies. The research firm Autonomous Next has said the number of such hedge funds has risen from around 30 to nearly 130 this year alone. More general-purpose hedge funds have also been buying up Bitcoin, like one run by Bill Miller, a well known mutual fund manager who spent most of his career with Legg Mason. Even more big investors are looking at the space after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last week that it would launch a Bitcoin futures contract in the next few months. The contract will make it easier for financial institutions plugged into the exchange to get involved with the Bitcoin market without having to worry about holding Bitcoin itself. Bobby Cho, the head trader at one of the largest Bitcoin trading businesses, Cumberland, said that after years of hesitancy, institutional investors now accounted for most of his business. “The vast majority of the trading we do is with institutions,” Mr. Cho said. “The education and research have turned into real-life activity.” The entrance of these big investors creates new risks for Bitcoin. Kevin Zhou, a longtime trader in the space, said that hedge funds were more likely than small investors to pull out a lot of money at once, and that Bitcoin was still small enough that a single fund’s cashing out could cause the price to drop sharply. “You could get a possible run on the bank if one large investor withdraws and that causes the price to tank,” said Mr. Zhou, a co-founder of the trading firm Galois Capital. “That could cause a cascade of withdrawals.” The rising importance of Wall Street is an unexpected turn for a virtual currency that was invented in 2008 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to operate outside the traditional financial system. Bitcoins, even those held by hedge funds, are recorded and stored on a decentralized database known as the blockchain, kept on a network of computers around the world. The whole system is governed by so-called open source software that is maintained by a community of volunteer programmers. The lack of backing from any government or established institution has concerned many large banks. The chief executive of Credit Suisse, Tidjane Thiam, said last week that he saw no inherent value in Bitcoin, joining the list of bankers who have called the market a bubble. But some financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs’s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, and Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, have defended the idea that virtual currencies could one day play a role in the global financial system because they can be obtained by anyone with internet access. The debate about Bitcoin has been part of a broader explosion of interest this year in the various technological concepts introduced by the virtual currency. Many banks, including JPMorgan, have been trying to find ways to create their own decentralized databases, like the Bitcoin blockchain, that could provide a more reliable and secure way to track information. In the technology industry, there has been a rush this year of so-called initial coin offerings, a way for entrepreneurs to raise money by creating and selling their own custom virtual currencies. Initial coin offerings have taken over $3 billion from investors this year after attracting almost no interest before. These coin offerings have created their own demand for Bitcoin because the new coins generally have to be bought with an existing virtual currency like Bitcoin. The interest in Bitcoin could be dampened in the coming weeks, however, by a debate among Bitcoin followers. Bitcoin start-ups and programmers have been fighting for nearly three years about the best way to update the software that governs the currency and the network on which it lives. The battle is expected to come to a head this month when new Bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency start-ups, is released. The new software aims to double the number of transactions flowing through the network. Currently, the computers processing Bitcoin transactions are limited to about five transactions per second. Most of the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own Bitcoins. Some of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate Bitcoins. A Bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors. But several signals suggest that the proposed rule changes are not likely to win enough support to survive for long, which would leave the status quo in place. Bitcoin has already survived past attempts to fork the software and create imitators. In August, a group of former Bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee. The price of Bitcoin temporarily wavered before Bitcoin Cash was introduced. All previous holders of Bitcoin were automatically granted the same number of Bitcoin Cash, and the value of those has also been rising, essentially doubling in the last month. Chris Burniske, a co-author of a book on virtual currency investing, “Cryptoassets,” said most of the new investors weren’t too concerned about the exact design of Bitcoin or the current debates. “I don’t think a lot of the new buyers are overly concerned about the long-term technical aspects of Bitcoin,” he said. They are “simply approaching it as a financial instrument.”",0.16537333333333334,0.11430438741153025
30,Donors Use Bitcoin for Tax Benefits and to Keep Tabs on Spending,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/bitcoin-charity-donations.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-11-06T10:00:29+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Like many Americans, Brad Hines spent much of September watching hours of hurricane coverage on television. For Mr. Hines, a digital marketing strategist in Boston, the storms hit close to home: Several family members in Florida were affected by Hurricane Irma. As the devastation unfolded, he opened his computer and donated money to the Red Cross, but it was not in cash. He gave in Bitcoin, which the Red Cross has been accepting since late 2014. He could have donated dollars, but, he said, the more he can use the cryptocurrency for buying goods and giving to charity, the more it will be used by others. “I want to pitch in and help get the currency adopted,” he said. “And it’s also fun to use.” It was his first donation with Bitcoin, the virtual currency that was created in 2008, but it will not be his last. As more charities accept digital currency, the more likely he will open his virtual wallet instead of his physical one, he said. Few people are donating to the Red Cross with Bitcoin, with the group receiving just $2,000 worth of the currency in 2017, but the numbers are rising elsewhere. Fidelity Charitable, a $16 billion donor-advised fund, has received $13.5 million in Bitcoin donations this year, up from the $4.1 million it received from November 2015, when the fund started accepting the cryptocurrency, to December 2016. Why would someone donate with Bitcoin over dollars? There are two reasons: It can be tax advantageous, and the technology the currency is built on could make it easier to see how a donation is being used, forcing charities to become more transparent. For many Bitcoin holders, the main impetus for donating their cryptocurrency is taxes. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service classified cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin and other digital dollars like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple, as an asset, like a stock, which means that sales are subject to capital gains. With a unit of Bitcoin rising to just over $7,000 this month from about $340 in early November 2014, sellers could be subject to hefty taxes depending on when they bought and sold. If they give those coins to charity, the asset is not subject to capital gains and donors still get to deduct the asset’s value from their taxes as a charitable donation. That’s partly why Fidelity Charitable began accepting Bitcoin donations. Its donors were asking about it, and the fund saw an opportunity after the I.R.S. clarified the rules. “We didn’t do anything until the I.R.S. determined that it was going to be treated as an asset,” said Matt Nash, Fidelity Charitable’s senior vice president of donor engagement. “If you look at an overall mix of a portfolio and one asset is gaining value much faster than another, then it’s strategic to donate that asset to charity. You’re getting better overall value for the dollar.” Mr. Nash said that the fund did not accept Bitcoin directly and that it did not hold any cryptocurrencies in its own portfolio. The fund uses Coinbase, a digital asset exchange company, to accept donations and convert them into dollars as soon as they come in. It’s a similar process with stocks. Fidelity Charitable turns assets it receives into cash right away, but it’s even more important that the fund transfers Bitcoins into dollars because of its volatility. Bitcoin fell by nearly 20 percent from Aug 28 to Sept. 11, for instance. Fidelity does not want to be caught holding something that can decline so quickly. Some technology entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that the system these currencies are built on can alter how people give and track their donations. Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain, a digital ledger that records transactions. Normally, when someone pays cash for an item in a store, the transaction is seen by only the buyer and the seller. With a blockchain, the transaction is recorded in a digital ledger in near real time that anyone can see. It is also impossible for transaction details to be changed. Because everything is tracked, donors can easily see that their payments have gone from their digital wallets into a charity’s hands. It’s this tracking mechanism that has many in the nonprofit sector excited. If everyone who touches a donation accepts Bitcoin, like the charity and the store providing the supplies, then donors can see how their donations are being used. “Having that tracking mechanism would certainly be something that donors would be interested in,” said Steve MacLaughlin, vice president of data and analytics at Blackbaud, which develops software for nonprofits. “The nonprofit that creates the shortest distance between gift and outcome wins.” Ideally, if donations can be better tracked, organizations will have to be more upfront about how they are spending their money, including how much goes toward overhead, said Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin expert and author of “The Internet of Money.” “You’ve seen numerous scandals where charitable donations end up being used for operating costs,” he said. “It’s very difficult to see where a donation is going, but this could change that.” Raphaël Mazet, a founder of Alice, a London-based software company that helps charities accept donations, said that end-to-end transparency was a long way off. Most of the organizations that charities give their money to do not accept digital currencies, so tracking stops when a cryptocurrency is converted into cash. Currency volatility is also holding tracking back, Mr. Mazet said. If the value of the currency strikingly drops before it is used, that donation will be worth a lot less than initially planned. His company transfers digital donations into a proprietary coin that’s essentially worth one British pound to avoid those ups and downs. “There is the potential for currencies to be sent around the world, but these issues make it difficult to work with blockchain right now,” he said. Still, technology companies like Alice, and Toronto-based Grace Token, are hoping to revolutionize giving. Both operate on the Ethereum blockchain, which Mr. Mazet said was more sophisticated than the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows people to use smart contracts, which give funders greater flexibility over how their donations are spent. With Alice, which is working with the homeless shelter St. Mungo’s in London, donations are released once the charity meets its goals, like finding a place for someone to stay and receiving mental health care. Those milestones are verified by the Greater London Authority. “Once those goals are validated, payment is triggered and then reported to the funders,” Mr. Mazet said. “So you know that your money has gone to help a person find a flat.” Grace Token, which is still building its software, will work in a similar way. It will allow donors to distribute funds at different times and only if certain goals are met. Funders will also be able to take back unused portions of donations if they feel their money is not being spent properly. “Traditionally, you can’t get your money back or determine how it’s being used,” said Michael Yeung, a founder of Grace Token. “Now we can specify a time or conditions to each donation.” Mr. Mazet will not go as far as to call his technology disruptive, but he does say it is bringing “massive innovation” to how charities track, measure and report gifts. It is likely that as more people start using digital money, the more cryptocurrency donations will be made. If these currencies keep rising, then it will continue to make sense to donate in Bitcoin purely for the tax advantage, said Mr. Nash of Fidelity Charitable. For Mr. Hines, who gave money to the Red Cross using Bitcoin, donating with the cryptocurrency is no different from donating anything else. “It’s easy to do,” he said. “And it lends credence to the currency.”",0.30250724637681164,0.13253536922015183
31,How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/how-floyd-mayweather-helped-two-young-guys-from-miami-get-rich.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-10-27T14:21:20+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Floyd Mayweather, perhaps the greatest boxer of his generation, is not shy about using social media to display the wealth that his years of prize fighting have won him. On Facebook, you can find videos of Mr. Mayweather draped in diamond chains. Want to see him with blocks of $100 bills taped to his torso? There’s that, too. Recently, Mr. Mayweather has shown his appreciation for a new kind of money. In September, he told his 13.5 million followers on Facebook not once but twice that they should buy a new virtual currency known as the Centra token. “Get yours before they sell out,” he wrote above a picture of himself admiring the many boxing title belts he had been awarded over the years. “I got mine and as usual I’m going to win big with this one!” Mr. Mayweather is among the many celebrities who have recently endorsed an initial coin offering, the name for a hot but loosely regulated new method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell their own virtual currencies to investors around the world. The boxer’s endorsement of Centra, along with a similar endorsement from the popular rapper DJ Khaled, lent a patina of credibility to a project that has ended up with more than a few problems, including a chief executive who does not appear to have been a real person and a shaky, fast-shifting business plan. Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra’s founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case. Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year’s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months. Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens — Centra, Stox and Hubiits — has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather. But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs. “It’s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. “But I’m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects.” The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records. Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened. Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks — like the next generation of the internet. But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators. The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company’s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build. The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani’s old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills. “You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!” he wrote in one post. The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra’s founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies. “Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world’s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,” the announcement said. Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time. The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra’s website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra — and none of the details on Mr. Edwards’s LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out. Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company’s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted. The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums. “When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,” Mr. Sharma said in an interview. Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company’s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo. There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said. After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards. But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed. “Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,” Mr. Gendron said. Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company’s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had. Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn’t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent. The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla., who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month. “He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,” Mr. Fern said. “It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.” Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was “a kid.” He said the landlord’s statements were “not accurate.” For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising. The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had “a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.” Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma’s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment. “As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,” the indictment said. Mr. Sharma said that he couldn’t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra. “I’m obviously not comfortable with that situation,” he said. “But it’s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.” He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather. Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra’s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures. “He’ll do anything we ask,” Mr. Trapani said. “He’ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.” The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid. After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post. Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather’s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. “We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,” Mr. Sharma said. “It was a very direct, individual deal.” Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment. Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings. In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: “Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!” Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million. Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project — a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars. For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them. Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money. Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything. But they say that won’t happen. Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people. “I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,” Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. “Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.” Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma’s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled. “What’s important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product,” a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment. “That’s what matters to investors!”",0.04926959459459461,0.032388212388212385
32,An Explanation of Initial Coin Offerings,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-10-27T14:13:23+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Initial coin offerings have come out of nowhere in 2017 to become the talk of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Programmers have raised over $3.2 billion this year by selling their own virtual currencies to investors. That is 3,000 percent more than the amount raised using coin offerings in 2016. Coin offerings are a way for start-ups or online projects to raise money without selling stock or going to venture capitalists — essentially a new form of crowdfunding. The programmers raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currency, generally with rules similar to well-known virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building. Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build. “Promising to build” is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished. These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist — to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity — and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem. Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What’s more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology. But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value. (For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.) The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don’t get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it. Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo. In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed. In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase. After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding — similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up. The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future. The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn’t even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million. Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don’t have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors. Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won’t fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin’s cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company. It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything. Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering. China and South Korea have said it is illegal. In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds. If a coin is categorized as a security, it has to follow all relevant securities law, such as registering with the authorities and ensuring that people buying the coins are properly accredited and vetted. Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules. Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down. Some are expecting that the first targets will be the exchanges where the coins are traded. Investors don’t have much recourse. The most likely outcome will be that the investors will lose the money they put into the project, though people may try to sue. A number of prominent Silicon Valley investors have argued that coin offerings could provide a way to build open-source projects that would not have otherwise received support. Some big names think this will lead to a new generation of open-source internet protocols and loosen the control of big companies like Google and Facebook. Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has argued that “by enabling the development of new open networks, tokens could help reverse the centralization of the internet, thereby keeping it accessible, vibrant and fair, and resulting in greater innovation.” But even sophisticated enthusiasts believe that almost all of the companies currently raising money through coin offerings will fail and lose money for their investors — and probably should not happen in the first place. “Right now, with all of the enthusiasm for crypto assets out there, I am very concerned that nobody is being careful about anything,” Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog.",0.20794509803921568,0.15383060294825002
33,"Understanding Ethereum, Bitcoin’s Virtual Cousin",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/what-is-ethereum.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-10-01T23:00:10+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Bitcoin has many cousins and competitors. None have grown more popular than Ethereum, a global computer network with its own virtual currency, called Ether. Ethereum is a global computing network operating according to rules defined by Ethereum software. Those rules allow the Ethereum network to be programmed to complete certain types of computing tasks, with every computer on the network completing the task in parallel to ensure it is done correctly. Generally the tasks involve money. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has likened it to a global smartphone that can be programmed to operate according to the apps built on top of it. The apps are called Dapps because they are run by a decentralized network of computers. Mr. Buterin says he chose the name because it refers to “the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.” He announced Ethereum in late 2013, but it didn’t go into operation until 2015. The Ethereum network has its own virtual currency, Ether. In the simplest sense, Ether are needed to pay the other computers on the network to complete tasks. It isn’t free to use the network. People have also decided to buy and hold Ether, betting that it will become more valuable as more people want to use the network and need Ether to pay for the network’s computing power. Mr. Buterin was a Bitcoin aficionado, and he was inspired by its success. But he set out to build something that could do more than Bitcoin: He wanted to build a system that would make it possible to program more complex financial transactions. The shared records of the Ethereum network — of every transaction and computation it has ever performed — are known as a blockchain, just as the shared records of all Bitcoin transactions are known as a blockchain. But Ethereum’s blockchain database is totally independent of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Let’s say two companies want to conduct a complicated financial transaction, like settling a stock option. Neither company trusts the other company to conduct the transaction on its computers. Both companies could hire a third party, like a stock exchange, to conduct the transaction, which is what they generally do today. But that forces them to trust that third company and to pay that company fees. With Ethereum, they can conduct the transaction on a shared computer that allows them both to check the records, ideally saving on fees. As this example suggests, Ethereum has proved attractive to financial companies that have to complete lots of complicated financial transactions with competitors they don’t trust. Many banks are looking at how Ethereum could be used as a central operating system for various trading markets, replacing today’s exchanges and middlemen. JPMorgan Chase has even created its own version of Ethereum, known as Quorum. Other companies, like Samsung and Toyota, have experimented with Ethereum as a way to keep track of products moving through supply chains that involve many players. Dozens of large companies around the world came together this year to create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The group is working to develop versions of the Ethereum software that are battle tested enough to be used in a corporate setting. The versions of the Ethereum software that companies are building will most likely be used to set up private networks that would be totally separate from the public Ethereum network and that would not use the Ether currency. Some people, though, are betting that these private networks will eventually be plugged back into the public network. Just as with Bitcoin, you can buy Ether from people who already own them on virtual currency exchanges. Most large countries have exchanges where a variety of virtual currencies can be bought with the local currency. Just as with Bitcoin, Ethereum are “mined,” or created by computers joined into the Ethereum network. These computers are in a race to complete the transactions and computing work on the network. The faster your computers, the more likely you are to win the race and receive a bundle of new Ether. There is generally a new winner every 15 seconds or so. It has not yet been decided how many Ether will ultimately be distributed, but the number is likely to be around 100 million. So far, 94 million have been distributed. As with Bitcoin, Ethereum mining serves a dual process of getting new Ether into the world while providing an incentive for people to join the network and help maintain the Ethereum blockchain.",0.2244675,0.1760573593073593
34,"What Is Bitcoin, and How Does It Work?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/what-is-bitcoin-price.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-10-01T22:45:45+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"If you find the concept of Bitcoin confusing, you are not alone. The virtual currency has been a constant source of controversy, but it is still not well understood. No. Those coins are novelty items that newspapers used in photographs because they couldn’t find anything else to illustrate their stories about Bitcoin. A Bitcoin is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. A Bitcoin can be divided out to eight decimal places, so you can send someone 0.00000001 Bitcoins. This smallest fraction of a Bitcoin — the penny of the Bitcoin world — is referred to as a Satoshi, after the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. This all gets confusing, because Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which the Bitcoin digital tokens are stored and moved. Unlike traditional payment networks like Visa, the Bitcoin network is not run by a single company or person. The system is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the way Wikipedia is maintained by a decentralized network of writers and editors. The record of all Bitcoin transactions that these computers are constantly updating is known as the blockchain. Criminals have taken to Bitcoin because anyone can open a Bitcoin address and start sending and receiving Bitcoins without giving a name or identity. There is no central authority that could collect this information. Bitcoin first took off in 2011 after drug dealers began taking payments in Bitcoin on the black-market website known as the Silk Road. Although the Silk Road was shut down in 2013, similar sites have popped up to replace it. More recently, Bitcoin has become a method for making ransom payments — for example, when your computer is taken over by so-called ransomware. The records of the Bitcoin network, including all balances and transactions, are stored on every computer helping to maintain the network — about 9,500 computers in late 2017. If the government made it illegal for Americans to participate in this network, the computers and people keeping the records in other countries would still be able to continue. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is also one of the qualities that have made it popular with people who are suspicious of government authorities. Anyone helping to maintain the database of all Bitcoin transactions — the blockchain — could change his or her own copy of the records to add more money. But if someone did that, the other computers maintaining the records would see the discrepancy, and the changes would be ignored. Only a small percentage of all transactions on the Bitcoin network are explicitly illegal. Most transactions are people buying and selling Bitcoins on exchanges, speculating on future prices. A whole world of high-frequency traders has sprung up around Bitcoin. People in countries with high inflation, like Argentina and Venezuela, have bought Bitcoin with their local currency to avoid losing their savings to inflation. One of the most popular business plans is to use Bitcoin to move money over international borders. Large international money transfers can take weeks when they go through banks, while millions of dollars of Bitcoin can be moved in minutes. So far, though, these practical applications of Bitcoin have been slow to take off. There are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoins in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of identity verification to satisfy the authorities. For people who do not want to reveal their identities, services like LocalBitcoins will connect people who want to meet in person to buy and sell Bitcoins for cash, generally without any verification of identity required. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges. Bitcoin mining refers to the process through which new Bitcoins are created and given to computers helping to maintain the network. The computers involved in Bitcoin mining are in a sort of computational race to process new transactions coming onto the network. The winner — generally the person with the fastest computers — gets a chunk of new Bitcoins, 12.5 of them right now. (The reward is halved every four years.) There is generally a new winner about every 10 minutes, and there will be until there are 21 million Bitcoins in the world. At that point, no new Bitcoins will be created. This cap is expected to be reached in 2140. So far, about 16 million Bitcoin have been distributed. Every Bitcoin in existence was created through this method and initially given to a computer helping to maintain the records. Anyone can set his or her computer to mine Bitcoin, but these days only people with specialized hardware manage to win the race. Plenty. But these other virtual currencies do not have as many followers as Bitcoin, so they are not worth as much. As in the real world, a currency is worth only as much as the number of people willing to accept it for goods and services. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by an unknown creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who communicated only by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, no one has been confirmed as the real Satoshi, and the search has gone on. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software.",0.059004,0.06256179653679654
35,"Despite Bitcoin’s Dive, a Former Soviet Republic Is Still Betting Big on It",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/georgia-bitcoin-blockchain-bitfury.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-01-22,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"TBILISI, Georgia — For three years, a windowless warehouse on the edge of town has been whirring with enough energy to power nearly 50,000 homes. Day and night, the warehouse, and dozens of cargo containers in a windswept valley, are generating Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that has created a virtual gold rush in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Bitfury, a bitcoin technology company, is churning out millions of dollars’ worth of the digital money using ultracheap hydropower harvested from waters rushing down the volcanic peaks of the Caucasus. Even as the currency has tumbled in value, thousands of Georgians have jumped into the game and sold cars — even cows — to buy high-powered computers to mine Bitcoin and join what has become a state-supported dash toward data supremacy. A former prime minister encouraged Bitfury, then based in San Francisco, with a $10 million loan in 2015. The governing Georgian Dream party sold 45 acres for $1 for Bitfury to set up shop. The government has been selling energy at half the rates charged in the United States or Europe, and it has created tax-free zones to draw in tech-savvy entrepreneurs. The efforts have given Georgia, with 3.7 million people, a dubious distinction. It is now an energy guzzler, with nearly 10 percent of its energy output gone into the currency endeavor. The country consumed so much power in recent years that the World Bank ranked it one of the most active cryptocurrency sites in the world. The whole experiment is likely to face immediate challenges as the price of Bitcoin declines, after a spectacular rise tempted investors around the world to bet on cryptocurrencies. Most companies tend to lose money when the price of Bitcoin falls below energy costs, and mining operators worldwide have recently been scaling back. The largest mining company, the Chinese company Bitmain, has been closing offices and laying off workers. Last week, Bitfury, which incorporated in London in 2018, announced layoffs at a facility in Canada. Georgia, however, has been betting its economy on luring blockchain technology, the encrypted storage capability behind all crypto transactions. Bitfury has helped migrate most of Georgia’s land registry to blockchain, making the government one of the first to rely on the secure digital ledger. Its tax system may soon follow. Georgia aims to beat Malta, Bermuda and other countries known for light-touch regulation of cryptocurrencies to dominate blockchain development. “The economy’s digital transformation is our highest priority,” said George Kobulia, the economy minister. “We’re supporting this any way we can.” In downtown Tbilisi, a neon-lit Marriott welcomes tourists. A nearby shopping mall installed a special A.T.M. for Bitcoin withdrawals. A cryptocurrency exchange flashes the prices of Bitcoin, Ether and other digital money on a ticker. When street protests ousted the last Soviet-era leader in 2003, the government, struggling with poverty, corruption and grinding bureaucracy, began selling itself as a business-friendly low-tax outpost for investment. Big financial institutions came in. So did casinos. A private company willing to take a risk was Bitfury, founded in 2011 by a tech savant from Latvia who was proselytizing about a strange virtual industry. Remi Urumashvili, a well-connected lawyer and now Bitfury’s main representative in Georgia, said that when Valery Vavilov, the co-founder and chief executive, approached him to seek advice on building a cryptocurrency operation, he was baffled. “They told me they wanted to mine Bitcoins, and I’m asking them, ‘Hey, guys, what’s a Bitcoin?’” Mr. Urumashvili recalled. Mr. Vavilov told him that the currency had introduced a new technology, blockchain, that had the potential for widespread use in business. Mr. Urumashvili said he had seen a potential tax advantage. “They explained that it’s money that exists on the internet,” he said. “So I said, ‘If a thing doesn’t exist in reality, maybe the tax will be zero.’” Mr. Urumashvili worked hard to lobby lawmakers to keep Georgia an open market for cryptocurrency. “I don’t like regulations,” he said, arching an eyebrow. “And there are very few regulations here for anything.” As soon as Bitfury opened its doors, Georgia created “free economic zones” where mining activities and electricity weren’t taxed. When Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were exchanged for dollars or pounds, Georgia treated the exchange as an export exempt from value added taxes, so Bitfury could keep every penny of earnings. Rumors have swirled that Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister from the Georgian Dream party and the country’s richest oligarch, has been a secret beneficiary of the digital experiment. He gave Bitfury a $10 million loan through his investment fund when Bitfury’s executive vice chairman, George Kikvadze, sat on his investment board. Mr. Ivanishvili declined an interview. Mr. Urumashvili of Bitfury said that no laws had been violated to encourage Bitfury, and that the former prime minister’s loan had been paid off. He had no other ties to Bitfury, Mr. Urumashvili added. The government even expanded an entire power station next to the Bitfury facility to pump in electricity at no extra cost. With energy prices at 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, Bitfury and its supporters could envision prosperity, if not around the corner then somewhere just beyond the fog of Georgia’s storied mountains. When Bitfury came to Georgia, one Bitcoin was worth around $350. It spiked to nearly $20,000 before tumbling. Big players like Bitfury have bandwidth to keep operating. But smaller investors have been far more vulnerable. In villages across Georgia, an estimated 200,000 people secured mining computers to set up in basements and garages. For young people especially who struggled in a tough economy, Bitcoin seemed an alluring alternative to just making ends meet. Joining the rush was George Kirvalidze, 35, the former owner of a small internet company in the town of Kvareli, three hours from Tbilisi in Georgian wine country. About half the town’s 6,000 households have some kind of a mining rig, he said. “Most people who bought in thought high prices would last forever,” said Mr. Kirvalidze, who has managed to mine 20 Bitcoins. Even farmers got involved. “At one point it was more profitable than owning a cow,” he said. “Now it’s not so sure.” Cryptocurrency lives off a blizzard of mathematical calculations. Computers, or miners, around the world compete to solve complex formulas on the blockchain. When a mining computer gets the right answer, it is given a bundle of new Bitcoins as a reward. The constant calculating superheats computers, and the energy demand — to power the computers and to cool them — has spiraled in places where such currencies are pursued. To save energy, Mr. Kirvalidze created a mining pool with nine friends, who grouped their machines in a friend’s garage. One November afternoon, 15 of the 60 miners were turned off because Bitcoin prices had fallen too low to justify the energy use. More would shut down if prices continued to slump, he added. “Bitfury is one step ahead of us,” Mr. Kirvalidze observed, citing the company’s cutting-edge technology and quasi-state backing in Georgia. “If we could get cheaper energy prices, too, we could make more,” he said. “That would increase money circulating in the economy and eventually improve growth.” Forty-five minutes from the center of Tbilisi, trucks rumble over two-lane roads and past faded pink and yellow high-rises. A prison, in matching pink and yellow paint, blights a cow pasture. In the middle of the valley rises the gray confines of Bitfury, plunked on a 40-acre concrete strip protected by guards and a high wire fence. In a warehouse as big as a Walmart, Ilia Koranashvili, a muscular engineer with a snake tattoo, walked around 160 hermetically sealed stainless steel tanks filled with power-efficient chips and a special cooling liquid. The tanks are Bitfury’s experiment to keep energy costs down and make the mining cost effective almost anywhere, said Mr. Koranashvili, who heads Bitfury’s monitoring team. Industry estimates suggest the company mines just over 5 percent of all Bitcoins, although no one would say how much was being mined here. But competitors in Georgia reckon it was a fortune. Vakhtang Gogokhia, the chief executive of Golden Fleece, a small cryptomining start-up, said he was pulling in around 10 Bitcoins a month using one megawatt of energy, enough to light 1,000 homes. Bitfury says it constantly consumes at least 45 megawatts of energy, though Mr. Gogokhia suspected it was more. Critics say the government, by subsidizing operations like Bitfury, is ripping off taxpayers by forcing them to foot the bill for well-connected companies. Zurab Tchiaberashvili, a lawmaker from European Georgia, the largest opposition party in Parliament, said the government’s generosity toward Bitfury had deprived Georgians of millions in tax revenue. “It’s a huge conflict of interest,” he said. Mr. Urumashvili brushed off such concerns. “Bitfury has given our country many things, including a path to the future,” he said. “When you have a ticket to get onto the world map,” he added, “you should use it.” Still, as Bitcoin prices highlight the uncertain nature of cryptocurrencies, the government isn’t putting all of its eggs in one basket. “Georgia is interesting for cryptocurrency miners,” said Mr. Kobulia, the economy minister. “But would it be a major source of our economic growth? Maybe not.”",0.11955106382978724,0.05097568261132091
36,Bitcoin Bug Bites Japan and South Korea as China Clamps Down,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/bitcoin-japan-south-korea.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-10-01T22:22:32+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Until recently, China was a center of Bitcoin activity while the rest of Asia looked on with little interest. Now, the tables have turned. The Chinese government has been clamping down on virtual currency activity at the same time that hundreds of thousands of Japanese have thrown themselves into Bitcoin trading, making Japan’s main Bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer, the largest in the world in recent weeks by some methods of counting. South Koreans have also shown a sudden interest in virtual currencies, though they have generally opted for Bitcoin competitors like Ethereum and Ripple. Trading has been so popular that two South Korean exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, have set up storefronts in Seoul that people can visit to buy and sell in person. Since Bitcoin was created in 2009, it has become increasingly popular around the world because of its anti-establishment appeal — a virtual currency that is challenging governments and financial institutions. But in South Korea and Japan, the countries’ most important institutions have been leading the way. Japanese trading took off after the government approved legislation in April that creates the first national licensing program in the world for virtual currency exchanges. On Friday, the government announced that it was giving the first licenses to 11 exchanges, including bitFlyer. “Japanese people tend to be very conservative with their investments, but once they get triggered they go all in,” said Yuzo Kano, the founder and chief executive of bitFlyer. In South Korea, trading ticked up after the country’s largest company, Samsung, announced in May that it had joined a large alliance of global companies aimed at finding corporate use for the software behind Ethereum. Ethereum includes a virtual currency, Ether, but it is also software that allows parties to enter into what are essentially legal agreements, or smart contracts, involving the money. The South Korean government moved last week to curb some of the frenzy. Korean regulators announced on Friday that new virtual currencies, being sold through so-called initial coin offerings, will be banned in the country. The regulators also said they would exercise stricter oversight of online exchanges. But trading in the most valuable coins went on after the announcement. (Regulators in the United States and Switzerland also took steps on Friday to crack down on the offerings.) Companies in both Japan and South Korea have been experimenting with the blockchain, the technology introduced by Bitcoin that allows multiple parties to keep shared digital records. And a consortium of Japanese banks announced last week that they were preparing to introduce a national digital cash, J Coin, that shares some qualities with Bitcoin. Even North Korea is getting in on the game, with reports suggesting that people with ties to the government have been trying to “mine” new Bitcoins and to hack into virtual currency exchanges in South Korea and elsewhere. Digital money like Bitcoin, which exists outside the traditional financial system, could be useful for a country trying to evade financial sanctions. So far, though, virtual currency trading in Japan and South Korea has not been tied, in any significant way, to buying or selling things with Bitcoin or any of its competitors. Instead, interest in both Japan and South Korea appears to be linked to a longer history of speculative financial trading as a recreational pastime — and to the general interest in virtual goods. “Word just spreads really fast in Korea,” said Tony Lyu, the founder and chief executive of Korbit, a Korean exchange. “Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There’s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.” The interest in South Korea and Japan is picking up some of the slack in support of Bitcoin that has been lost to the crackdown in China. At various points in the past few years, China has been thought to account for over three-quarters of all Bitcoin trading. The government, though, has stepped in several times to cool the speculative fever. The latest measures appear to be the most serious yet. All Bitcoin exchanges have been told to stop trading by the end of October. Some in the Chinese Bitcoin community believe that business will be allowed to resume after the annual meeting of the People’s Congress, the national legislative body, takes place in mid-October — but there have been no clear indications of that. The price of most virtual currencies dropped sharply after the Chinese government’s moves leaked out in September. But it did not put a damper on interest in Japan and South Korea, and the prices of digital tokens recovered most of their losses. The price of Bitcoin recently stood around $4,300, down 12 percent from the high earlier last month. But that was up about 50 percent from the low last month and still up more than 340 percent since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin has been used — most controversially — to buy drugs online and make virtual ransom payments to hackers. More recently, it has provided a way for investors to put money into new starts-ups through initial coin offerings. Beyond all that, though, it is a speculative asset. People buy and sell it because it is scarce — only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created — and investors hope it will gain real-world applications in the future. Japan might have seemed like an obvious place for Bitcoin to catch on earlier. The anonymous creator of Bitcoin carried a Japanese name, Satoshi Nakamoto. But most people from Bitcoin’s early years believe that the person or people behind Bitcoin were not from Japan. Japan was also home to the first major Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. But Mt. Gox was run by a Frenchman living in Tokyo, with mostly foreign customers. Perhaps more important, Mt. Gox was run very poorly, leaving it vulnerable to thieves who eventually stole most of the Bitcoins the exchange held for its customers — some $500 million worth at the time. The collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014 scared many Japanese people away from Bitcoin. But it also encouraged the government to move forward with some of the most far-reaching legislation in the world, which gave a sort of government stamp of approval to the market when it was passed in April. The legislation promises licenses to exchanges that follow anti-money-laundering practices, and defined Bitcoin as a valid means of payment. Trading took off almost immediately. Much of the interest at bitFlyer, the largest exchange, has been for futures contracts, which are not as popular elsewhere. When these are included in tallies, bitFlyer is hosting more trading than any other exchange in the world, according to data from CryptoCompare. The legal status of virtual currencies in South Korea has been less clear than in Japan. But Samsung’s decision to join the so-called Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was enough of an institutional sign of approval for many Koreans. Corporations like Samsung are generally interested in using the Ethereum software without using the internal virtual currency, Ether. But the announcement set off a summer of feverish trading in Ethereum and a number of other Bitcoin alternatives. In recent days, the heaviest trading has been in a competitor to Bitcoin that was introduced in August, known as Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions. Trading volumes have been amplified in both South Korea and Japan because many of the exchanges offer leverage, which amplifies both positive and negative swings. Jeff Paik, the founder of Finector, a research firm in Seoul, said the trading had been worrisome because it had been dominated by older pensioners, not tech geeks. These traders, he said, have been deciding what coins to buy and sell not because of the underlying technology, but because of the number of other people trading the same thing. “There’s no logic to it,” Mr. Paik said. “As long as there is an open market, and a currency to be traded, people will flock into it. It doesn’t matter which coin.”",0.14985151515151515,0.10840755498710045

Freedom from regulation was the big draw of Bitcoin, Ether and their counterparts. But the exchanges set up to trade them often lack basic controls over identity, fraud, technology and even trading volume, a Reuters investigation shows. Without fixes, such weaknesses will consign those currencies to the financial fringe. These markets can be vulnerable to hacking. For instance, the exchange Kraken suffered a denial-of-service network interruption in May, during which the price of ether on its platform dropped 70 percent. Such reactions can be intensified by a lack of circuit breakers that halt trading. Virtual heists are common, too, according to the Reuters special report. About 980,000 Bitcoins have been stolen in at least 36 incidents since 2011. At current rates, that’s worth $4 billion. Some exchanges also fail to demand the most basic security checks and know-your-client procedures that more traditional venues insist on. The Poloniex exchange asked some users to supply only a name, email address and country of operation. And some Chinese exchanges have inflated deal flow to attract business, according to former employees. Such drawbacks have not averted a marked increase in interest over the last few months. The total market value of all digital currencies was $140 billion on Sept. 18, according the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, a more than tenfold increase over 12 months. Bitcoin accounts for around half the total value — and its price has surged 10 percent again in the last 10 days. It smells like bubble territory, with volatility making it even riskier. Speculators may like the wild swings, including the former Fortress executive Mike Novogratz, who is raising a $500 million digital-currency hedge fund. But that state of affairs attracts criminals, too. Digital-currency cases now account for three-quarters of the time the Federal Bureau of Investigation devotes fighting money laundering, it revealed at a recent Morgan Stanley event. The law enforcement agency also said that most ransom payments are now demanded in Bitcoin or one of its rivals. But it is the lack of a solid market structure that worries people like JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who recently argued that Bitcoin was “worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well.” He concluded, “It’s a fraud.” Dispelling that widespread notion will require the exchanges to raise their games greatly.",-0.0058039999999999915,0.045587301587301586
38,What Jamie Dimon Is Missing About Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-jamie-dimon.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-09-18T09:04:59+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is the most successful banker of his generation. He has successfully navigated a challenging environment over more than a decade, and his firm is stronger than ever. So naturally, given his status and success, his recent comments that Bitcoin was a “fraud” were taken seriously. Mr. Dimon’s comments may have come as a surprise to the dozens of employees at his bank working on projects related to blockchain, the bookkeeping technology underpinning digital currencies. And the comments must have been especially jarring to those employees who  were holding a forum for hedge funds interested in Bitcoin— whose market value stood at about $70 billion at that moment. It’s no secret that Bitcoin and other digital currencies may dramatically fall in value at any time. How can an asset whose value jumps by 20 percent some days, and which no one can accurately value, plausibly not also suffer huge declines? But that’s a long way from Bitcoin being a worthless fraud. While we are still in the early stages of digital currencies, and much can still go wrong, Mr. Dimon’s rationale for his negativity was curious. His core problem with Bitcoin? “You can’t have a business where people are going to invent a currency out of thin air,” he said. Yet as one of the world’s foremost bankers, Mr. Dimon is plainly aware that countries also create fiat currencies out of thin air. (In Latin, fiat means “let it be done.”) It has been more than four decades since Richard Nixon removed the American dollar from the gold standard. And in any event, most of gold’s value doesn’t arise from its physical attributes, since it doesn’t have any magical ability to create usefulness or generate financial dividends despite its attractive shiny yellow hue. It’s instead because investors have believed in its value for thousands of years. Of course, fiat currencies like the dollar have the backing of a sovereign nation. Digital currencies are obviously far more speculative, have been around for only a few years, and don’t have a government’s underlying support. But almost all currencies today are conjured up from nothing — the euro didn’t even exist 20 years ago — and their value is largely dependent on trust. Naturally, most people have more trust in the “full faith and credit of the United States” than in an anonymous distributed group of miners and traders. But trust in digital currency is clearly building over time and is a self-reinforcing network. And one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that its total supply is fixed. A fiat currency, on the other hand, can be devalued by centralized monetary policy. In his comments, Mr. Dimon cited the famed investor Howard Marks, who in a July memo to his clients referred to Bitcoin as an unfounded fad. But he seems to have missed Mr. Marks's subsequent backflip in which, while remaining a skeptic, the hedge fund mogul wrote, “There’s absolutely no reason why Bitcoin — or anything else — can’t serve as a currency if enough people accept it as such.” Mr. Dimon is also too modest about JPMorgan’s own achievements in this arena. His firm conjured up its own currency: Chase Ultimate Reward points, its credit card loyalty program. Millions of customers have accumulated billions of points, trusting in Chase’s promise that this currency can be converted into cash or used for travel and other delights. And they hope that Chase won’t unilaterally choose to devalue them, while living with the risk that, unlike their bank accounts, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides no insurance for this valuable currency. JPMorgan is even working on its own blockchain project, Quorum, which is built on the publicly accessible Ethereum network. Presumably, Mr. Dimon doesn’t think Ethereum, whose value is up more than 2,000 percent over the last year, is also a modern version of tulip mania. In Mr. Dimon’s telling, Bitcoin has value only for people who want to bypass the traditional banking system for illicit purposes, including “murderers and drug dealers,” or people living in countries with repressive governments like North Korea and Venezuela. He doubts that this is a large market opportunity, though perhaps he may concede that there are inherent difficulties in accurately sizing up markets where participants like to keep a low profile. Part of the promise of the blockchain, and associated digital currencies, is the absence of a central authority. It’s fair to say that the cult of decentralization may have run too far, with some enthusiasts imagining it as a panacea for every business problem. Centralized networks work well for many functions, like trading stocks or managing flight reservations. But new use cases for digital currencies are just starting to take shape. They are now being used to create value in the way that Silicon Valley has traditionally done so: regulatory arbitrage. Ride-hailing got its start avoiding onerous taxi medallion costs; Airbnb avoided hotel taxes and regulations; and YouTube played fast and loose with copyright rules. Similarly, some entrepreneurs are using the blockchain as a way to avoid certain regulatory requirements for raising capital. As a rule, Silicon Valley prefers to ask for forgiveness rather than permission. Companies are also creating tokens to align incentives around decentralized efforts like open source software or distributed storage networks. Undoubtedly, there will be plenty of hits and misses, as one would expect in the early days of a new technology. And there will be some outright scams as well. But the toothpaste is now out of the tube, and there is sufficient momentum for legitimate use cases to develop. Presumably, that’s why JPMorgan itself is investing resources in developing these technologies and applications. Economists use the term “cheap talk” for words that don’t have any payoff. Despite his withering Bitcoin critique, Mr. Dimon also said, “Don’t ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up.” Mr. Dimon added that he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin. But he didn’t say how he would deal with an employee who publicly identifies a $70 billion fraud — then doesn’t find a way to make a dime out of it.",0.1790767857142857,0.0726285470481899
39,Is There a Cryptocurrency Bubble? Just Ask Doge.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/business/cryptocurrency-bubble-doge.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-09-15T21:01:43+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Jackson Palmer no longer thinks it’s funny to imitate Doge, the internet meme about a Shiba Inu dog whose awe-struck expressions and garbled syntax (e.g. “Wow. So pizza. Much delicious.”) made him a viral sensation several years ago. But if he did, he might channel Doge to offer a few cautionary words for investors who are falling for cryptocurrency start-ups, Silicon Valley’s latest moneymaking craze: Very bubble. Much scam. So avoid. Mr. Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, was an early fan of cryptocurrency, a form of encrypted digital money that is traded from person to person. He saw investors talking about Bitcoin, the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, and wanted to find a way to poke fun at the hype surrounding the emerging technology. So in 2013, he built his own cryptocurrency, a satirical mash-up that combined Bitcoin with the Doge meme he’d seen on social media. Mr. Palmer hoped to use Dogecoin to show the absurdity of wagering huge sums of money on unstable ventures. But investors didn’t get the joke and bought Dogecoin anyway, bringing its market value as high as $400 million. Along the way, the currency became a magnet for greed and attracted a group of scammers and hackers who defrauded investors, hyped fake products, and left many of the currency’s original backers empty-handed. Today, Mr. Palmer, 30, is one of the loudest voices warning that a similar fate might soon befall the entire cryptocurrency industry. “What’s happening to crypto now is what happened to Dogecoin,” Mr. Palmer told me in a recent interview. “I’m worried that this time, it’s on a much grander scale.” Already, there are signs of trouble on the horizon. This week, after Chinese authorities announced a crackdown on virtual currencies, the value of Bitcoin briefly tumbled 30 percent before partially recovering. The value of Dogecoin fell more than 50 percent last week. Its market value by midday Friday was about $100 million. But there remains no bigger mania among tech investors than cryptocurrency, which some see as an eventual replacement for traditional, government-issued money. Even with the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin has more than tripled this year; another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has gained more than 2,300 percent. The success of these currencies has minted a new class of “crypto-millionaires” and spawned hundreds of other digital currencies, called altcoins. In addition, it has given rise to an entire category of start-ups that take advantage of cryptocurrency’s public ledger system, known as the blockchain. Many cryptocurrency start-ups have raised money through an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., a type of fund-raising campaign in which investors buy into a new venture using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and receive virtual “tokens” instead of stock or voting rights in the company. These tokens grant investors access to a product or service that will be built with the money raised in the I.C.O., such as cloud data storage or access to a new social network. (If you’re having trouble picturing it: Imagine that a friend is building a casino and asks you to invest. In exchange, you get chips that can be used at the casino’s tables once it’s finished. Now imagine that the value of the chips isn’t fixed, and will instead fluctuate depending on the popularity of the casino, the number of other gamblers and the regulatory environment for casinos. Oh, and instead of a friend, imagine it’s a stranger on the internet who might be using a fake name, who might not actually know how to build a casino, and whom you probably can’t sue for fraud if he steals your money and uses it to buy a Porsche instead. That’s an I.C.O.) Despite the obvious risks of these ventures, investor appetite has been ravenous. A group of Bay Area programmers this year used an I.C.O. to raise $35 million for their project, an anonymous web browser called Brave, in less than 30 seconds. There have been 140 coin offerings in 2017 that have raised a total of $2.1 billion from investors, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks the activity. I.C.O. fever has even infected celebrities. This month, the actress Paris Hilton tweeted that she was “looking forward to participating” in the initial coin offering of LydianCoin, a cryptocurrency project associated with the digital advertising company Gravity4. The boxing star Floyd Mayweather and the rapper the Game have also endorsed coin offerings. Unlike traditional stock offerings, which are carefully supervised and planned months or years in advance, I.C.O.s are largely unregulated in the United States, although that could soon change. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors this year about the growing number of coin offerings, saying that “fraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to convince potential victims to invest their money in scams.” Mr. Palmer predicts that while some I.C.O.s may finance the creation of new and exciting enterprises, many will go up in smoke. He sees echoes of the first dot-com boom, when investors poured money into new and risky ventures only to get burned when the market came to its senses. “People are treating cryptocurrency now like penny stocks,” he said. “It’s become a securities market.” Other high-profile skeptics have sounded the alarm about a potential crash in the crypto market, including Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who last week called Bitcoin a “fraud,” and compared the current digital money craze to the 17th-century Dutch tulip bubble. And even true cryptocurrency believers have started to worry that I.C.O. mania won’t end well. “It’s a ticking time bomb,” Charles Hoskinson, one of the developers of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, told Bloomberg in July. When Mr. Palmer’s interest in digital money began, just four years ago, cryptocurrency was the sole province of math geeks and early adopters. “It was fun, nobody took it seriously,” he recalled. “People threw it around like change because it wasn’t worth anything.” Unlike Bitcoin, whose early adopters often used it to buy drugs, weapons, or other illicit goods on the dark web, Dogecoin attracted a crowd of earnest do-gooders at first. They even set up a philanthropic arm, called the Dogecoin Foundation, and used it to raise thousands of dollars for projects, including sponsoring service dogs for autistic children and drilling water wells in Kenya. (Their generosity extended to quirkier projects; when Dogecoin fans heard that Jamaica’s two-man bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics in Sochi but lacked the money to get to Russia, they pitched in $30,000 to fund the trip.) As the price of Bitcoin climbed, investors got interested in other cryptocurrencies. With no explanation, the price of Dogecoin doubled, then tripled. Two months after it was introduced, Mr. Palmer’s joke was worth $50 million, and some early Dogecoin adopters, who called themselves “shibes,” were sitting on lucrative stockpiles. The success of Dogecoin attracted unsavory characters. One scammer raised $750,000 from Dogecoin supporters for a cryptocurrency start-up that never materialized. A hacker broke into Dogewallet, a website where users stored their coins, and stole thousands of dollars worth of the currency. Soon, the Dogecoin Reddit forum was full of angry scam victims and get-rich-quick schemers, and the once tight-knit Dogecoin community started to disintegrate. “We tried to do everything right,” said Ben Doernberg, a former board member of the Dogecoin Foundation. “But when you have a situation where people stand to put in a dollar and take out a thousand dollars, people lose their minds.” Mr. Palmer, a laid-back Australian who works as a product manager in the Bay Area and describes himself as “socialist leaning,” was disturbed by the commercialization of his joke currency. He had never collected Dogecoin for himself, and had resisted efforts to cash in on the currency’s success, even turning down a $500,000 investment offer from an Australian venture capital firm. In 2015, he announced he was leaving Dogecoin behind, telling an interviewer that the cryptocurrency market “increasingly feels like a bunch of white libertarian bros sitting around hoping to get rich and coming up with half-baked, buzzword-filled business ideas.” He recently began making a series of YouTube videos that explain tech topics to beginners, including how digital currencies work. His goal? To rekindle people’s excitement in the core blockchain technology, while tamping down some of the excessive hype. “My mission in all of this is to help people better understand things, rather than just thinking about profit,” he said. It may be too late for that. Regulators in the United States have begun to scrutinize I.C.O.s, and China’s central bank went as far as issuing a temporary ban on new coin offerings. But more dollars are still pouring into cryptocurrency ventures every day, as giddy investors ignore the warning signs and look to multiply their money. Mr. Palmer worries that the coming reckoning in the cryptocurrency market — and it is coming, he says confidently — will deter people from using the technology for more legitimate projects. “The bigger this bubble goes, the bigger negative connotation it’s going to have,” he said. “It’s going to be like the dot-com bust, but on a much more epic scale.”",0.09711818181818181,0.07258583047544087
40,China Bitcoin Exchange to Stop Trading Virtual Currencies Amid Crackdown,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/business/china-bitcoin-exchange.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-09-14T16:12:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"BEIJING — A major Chinese exchange specializing in the trading of Bitcoin announced on Thursday that it would stop trading by the end of the month, amid a broader crackdown against virtual currencies by the authorities in Beijing. The announcement by BTC China, the country’s first and largest digital currency exchange, came days after the Chinese authorities banned fund-raising for new digital currencies, and amid worries that regulators would tighten rules surrounding currencies like Bitcoin. The exchange’s decision is the first of its kind in China, and it raises the specter of other exchanges shutting down Bitcoin trading in the future. China has sought to walk a tightrope when it comes to Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies. Whereas the currencies provide the country with a chance to develop new and emerging technologies, officials also worry that they would allow Chinese consumers to get around tough restrictions on how much money they can send overseas and allow them to be used to launder money. Still, the impending closing of BTC China’s online currency trading operations is a blow to the country’s aspirations to lead the way in the sector. Some two-thirds of all Bitcoin issued daily is “mined” in China, and an array of other companies benefit from such efforts, including equipment suppliers and construction firms that build enormous Bitcoin farms. “It’s a sad day for the Bitcoin community here in China,” said Wei-Tek Tsai, the director of the Digital Society and Blockchain Laboratory at Beijing’s Beihang University. In a statement published on the messaging platform WeChat, BTC China said it would “stop all trading on September 30.” It said the move was in response to a decision this month by Chinese regulators to ban so-called initial coin offerings, in which new digital currencies seek to raise funds. The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, to around $3,500, in the hours after the announcement. Bitcoin is increasingly in the spotlight around the world. Its proponents — a group that includes tech enthusiasts, civil libertarians, hackers and criminals — cheer the fact that it can be sent across borders anonymously and that it is not regulated by a central authority like a typical currency. China has emerged as the leading force in Bitcoin trading in recent years. But as the virtual currency’s profile has risen in the country, Chinese regulators have increasingly sought to control how it is traded and used. When they stepped up their oversight of Bitcoin trading this year, it led to a rapid and substantial drop in trading volumes. “Because it is traded anonymously and peer to peer, Bitcoin makes it easy for money laundering and tax evasion,” said Sheng Songcheng, an adviser to the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. Official Chinese news media has cited officials as saying they want to close Bitcoin exchanges — a move that precipitated Thursday’s decision by BTC China — though they have not set a time frame. China Business Network, a financial and business news portal, said on Thursday that the authorities in Shanghai, where BTC China is registered, would close all Bitcoin exchanges within their jurisdiction by the end of the month; and the report piled on further uncertainty. Though the moves by the Chinese authorities this month have resulted in declines in the value of Bitcoin, some argue that they will allow for a more even geographic distribution in the online currency’s trading and mining. “The overall share of Chinese exchanges has been diminishing steadily,” said Thomas Glucksmann, marketing manager for the Hong Kong-based Bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Mr. Glucksmann said that much of the Bitcoin community had been concerned about the increased level of scrutiny in China and had been moving their assets out of the country. “People will realize that China is out of the picture for the moment,” he said.",0.038743478260869574,0.04787000439174352

Their spirits rose when a coal boom promised to bring factories and jobs to this land of grassy plains in Inner Mongolia. When the boom ebbed, they looked for work wherever they could. Today, many have found it at a place that makes money — the digital kind. Here, in what is locally called the Dalad Economic Development Zone, lies one of the biggest Bitcoin farms in the world. These eight factory buildings with blue-tin roofs account for nearly one-twentieth of the world’s daily production of the cryptocurrency. Based on today’s prices, it issues $318,000 in digital currency a day. From the outside, the factory — owned by a company called Bitmain China — does not look much different from the other buildings in the industrial park. Its neighbors include chemical plants and aluminum smelters. Some of the buildings in the zone were never finished. Except for the occasional coal-carrying truck, the roads are largely silent. Inside, instead of heavy industrial machinery, workers tend rows and rows of computers — nearly 25,000 computers in all — crunching the mathematical problems that create Bitcoin. Workers carry laptop computers as they walk the aisles looking for breakdowns and checking cable connections. They fill water tanks that keep the computers from melting down or bursting into flame. Around them, hundreds of thousands of cooling fans fill the building with whooshing white noise. Bitcoin’s believers say it will be the currency of the future. Purely electronic, it can be sent across borders anonymously without oversight by a central authority. That makes it appealing to a diverse and sometimes mismatched group that includes tech enthusiasts, civil libertarians, hackers and criminals. Bitcoin is also, by and large, made in China. The country makes more than two-thirds of all Bitcoin issued daily. Bitmain, founded by Jihan Wu, a former investment analyst, makes money mostly by selling equipment to make Bitcoins, as well as mining the currency itself. China has mixed feelings about Bitcoin. On one hand, the government worries that Bitcoin will allow Chinese people to bypass its strict limits on how much money they can send abroad, and could also be used to commit crimes. Chinese officials are moving to close Bitcoin exchanges, where the currency is bought and sold, though they have not set a time frame. While that would not affect Bitcoin manufacturing directly, it would make buying and selling Bitcoin more expensive in one of its major markets, potentially hurting prices. On the other hand, the digital currency may represent an opportunity for China to push into new technologies, a motivation behind its extensive push into other cutting-edge areas, like driverless cars and artificial intelligence. China continues to offer Bitcoin makers like Bitmain cheap electricity — making Bitcoin requires immense amounts of power — and other inducements. Dalad Banner may be far away from Beijing’s internet start-up scene and southern China’s gadget hub. Still, many of the workers and surrounding residents see a digital opportunity for Dalad Banner and the rest of their part of Inner Mongolia, an area famous in China for half-finished factories and towns so empty that they are sometimes called ghost cities. “Now the mine has about 50 employees,” said Wang Wei, the manager of Bitmain China’s Dalad Banner facility, using one of several metaphors for the work being done there. “I feel in the future it might bring hundreds or even thousands of jobs, like the big factories.” Mr. Wang, a 36-year-old resident and former coal salesman, purchased one Bitcoin about six months ago. It has since more than doubled in value. “I made quite a lot of money,” he said. China also sees a potential new source of jobs, particularly in underdeveloped places like Dalad Banner. The county of about 370,000 people on the edge of the vast Kubuqi Desert boasts coal reserves and coal-powered heavy industries like steel. But it lags behind much of the rest of the country in broadly developing its economy. It is part of the urban area of Ordos, a city about 350 miles away from Beijing famous for its empty buildings. Dalad Banner is not the sort of place that at first glance looks like a home for high-tech work. Indeed, the idea took some getting used to, even among the workers. “I didn’t know anything about Bitcoin then,” said Li Shuangsheng, a 28-year-old resident who maintains the operations of one of the eight factories. He bounced from job to job — the chemical plant was too noisy and polluted, he said — before he landed about one month ago at Bitmain China’s Dalad Banner factory, one of the few lucrative job opportunities in the sparsely populated region. Mr. Li does not yet own any Bitcoin, but he is happy with the work and studying up on the subject online when family time permits. “Now,” he said, “I’m starting to have some idea.” Many at the farm have experienced the ups and downs of the local economy. Bai Xiaotu was laid off from a state-owned furniture factory in 1997. He had been doing different menial jobs until he went to work at Bitmain’s Dalad Banner farm in December as a cleaner. “Look around, there are abandoned factories on both sides of our farm,” said Mr. Bai, a 53-year-old with a weather-beaten face. “Many factories are not doing that great.” But the industry is still new to most. Bai Dong, Mr. Bai’s 31-year-old son, had never heard of Bitcoin when his father first got the job. After searching on the internet, he found that the Bitcoin price was rising quickly and that the farm was one of the biggest in the world. “I feel positive about the future of the industry,” Mr. Bai said. But he is still confused what Bitcoin mining is. “We have coal mines,” he said. “Now we have a Bitcoin mine. They are both mines. What’s their relationship?”",0.05331166666666667,0.07263828763828763
42,Bitcoin Price Surges After Agreement on Software Update,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/business/dealbook/bitcoin-price-virtual-currency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-08-14T19:41:48+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The price of Bitcoin has rocketed to new highs after a long battle over the rules of the software was resolved, at least temporarily. The price of a Bitcoin has risen nearly 50 percent since the beginning of the month, raising the total value of all Bitcoins to more than $70 billion. On Monday afternoon, Bitcoin was trading above $4,290, an increase of about 7 percent. The price of Bitcoin, the virtual currency, has been climbing steadily for the last year as investors around the world have shown an interest in the unusual characteristics of its technology, which allows money to be held and moved on a network of computers without any central authority or bank involved. But the latest price increase occurred after the most important backers of the Bitcoin network agreed on a long-disputed update to the network’s software and rules. As Bitcoin has grown more popular, internal factions have been warring over the best way to update the software and allow more transactions to move through the system. A rule in the original software, released in 2009, limited the number of transactions that could move through the system to about five a second. In the last two years, an outspoken group of Bitcoin aficionados wanted to see the currency expand quickly to compete with Visa and PayPal. But that camp faced opposition from the so-called core developers, a few dozens programmers who maintain the basic Bitcoin software, generally on a volunteer basis. At the end of July, some of the people who wanted Bitcoin to expand quickly broke off and created a rival digital money, known as Bitcoin Cash, that can handle more frequent transactions. That new currency has attracted a small following, and retained a relatively stable value around $300. Most Bitcoin investors and companies, however, have stayed with the original Bitcoin network and the core developers who are working on it. The core developers have come up with their own solution to increase the number of transactions running through the system, known as Segregated Witness, or SegWit. While SegWit does not expand the network as quickly as Bitcoin Cash, it makes it easier to build services on top of the Bitcoin network, such as the so-called Lightning Network, that will allow for faster transactions. The biggest backers of the network agreed last week to proceed with SegWit, and it is that agreement, on scaling the network, that is the most obvious reason for the recent surge. “Scaling has been the major catalyst for the price rally,” said Charles Hayter, the founder of the data company CryptoCompare. “The scaling debate has certainly been holding the Bitcoin price back.” Many backers of the core developers have said that Bitcoin is more likely to be a base layer that other services are built atop. In this vision, Bitcoin would be more like gold in the old gold standard than like a payment network. The gold analogy and the scarcity of Bitcoin — the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million will ever be created — have led some investors to believe that the value of the currency will continue to rise as more people look to store their wealth in the system. This vision has caught particular fire in Japan and South Korea, which have accounted for an increasing proportion of all Bitcoin trading this year, taking over from China, which once was responsible for the highest trading volume. The introduction of SegWit does not resolve all of the arguments that have divided the Bitcoin community. Many large Bitcoin companies are still hoping to follow through with an agreement, reached in the spring, that would change the Bitcoin software in November to allow twice as many transactions to flow through the network. The core developers have made it clear in various forums that they do not plan to update the software in November to double the network capacity. When the November deadline is reached, some of the companies hoping to double the network capacity could again split off from the core developers. “There is a history of animosity between Bitcoin factions with vested interests, and these tensions could flare up again,” Mr. Hayter said. For now, though, Bitcoin has been rising steadily, and much faster than any of the competing virtual currencies that have cropped up in recent years. Earlier in the year, the prices of many other virtual currencies were rising faster than the price of Bitcoin, most of all Ethereum, a virtual currency that has more programmable features than Bitcoin. The price of Ethereum has been rising this month, but more slowly than Bitcoin and it remains below the record high it reached in June. On Monday, the price stood around $300. Investors are buying Ethereum and Bitcoin to invest in so-called initial coin offerings, a new method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs create and sell their own virtual currencies. Such offerings have continued to come onto the market despite warnings from regulators that some of them may violate securities laws.",0.27741875,0.1565035076530612
43,Mike’s and Katie’s Week in Tech: Uber Infighting and the Google Memo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/technology/mikes-and-katies-week-in-tech-uber-infighting-and-the-google-memo.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-08-12T13:00:09+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad is off this week, so Katie Benner, a Times technology reporter, filled in. Mike: Hello, Katie! Thanks for filling in for Farhad this week while he’s on his seventh vacation of 2017. I believe six of those have been long weekends to play golf at a club with friends, which is five more than the tech columnist who preceded him. Katie: Hoping Farhad comes back locked and loaded. His columns have lately lacked his signature fire and fury. Mike: O.K., let’s get into it, because it’s been quite a busy week in tech. I thought everyone went on vacation in August. First, we must note that SoundCloud seems to be in a perpetually precarious state. The company, which lets folks upload songs to the cloud while others congregate and comment on the tracks, has grown immensely popular over the years. But it has that one big problem that seems to catch up with all Silicon Valley companies: It needs to build itself a viable, long-term business. It appears they’ve come to a compromise. The company will raise another pile of money, on the condition that they bring in a new C.E.O. in a move which, I assume, means bringing in an “adult” to grow the business. It’s not really uncommon among Valley companies, I’d say. Everyone always points to Eric Schmidt or Sheryl Sandberg coming in to help the founders of Google and Facebook, respectively, with building a viable long-term company. And it worked! I do wonder, though, about SoundCloud’s chances. The music industry is particularly brutal. Go ask Pandora, Rdio and Spotify. Katie: One big difference for Google and Facebook is that they were on their way to being wildly profitable when the grown-ups came on to guide them. SoundCloud’s management issues have been wildly exacerbated by the fact that streaming music providers can’t make money. How many companies have overcome both problems to become huge success stories? SoundCloud’s best hope is to stabilize and sell itself to a buyer who can handle the losses and protect what has made the platform unique. As our colleague Jenna, the Beyoncé Whisperer, Wortham points out, SoundCloud has been the place to find lesser-known, cool, diverse and unique artists. SoundCloud’s valuation was reportedly slashed by about half, making it a much more attractive buy than it was at $700 million. So here’s hoping. Mike: Amen. Also, I need Jenna’s advice on how to join the Bey-hive someday. Moving on, Bitcoin is surging to record highs on a near daily basis. On Friday, it was at well over $3,500 per single Bitcoin, which is being compared to the volatility of the gold markets. Perhaps people have decided to diversify their portfolios in light of the looming threat of nuclear escalation? Risk-aversion in the time of war is funny to me, if not terribly ironic. Katie: Jack Dorsey thinks Bitcoin is going to be big. And he’s the guy who introduced the world to being woke. I think it’s time to put all of my assets into two things only: Bitcoin and shares of The New York Times. Mike: Well, maybe I’ll skip Bitcoin and go right to Ethereum. I’m obliged to note the ongoing fighting over at Uber, where most recently Benchmark, a major investor with a seat on the company’s board,  sued Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive. It’s all about control over the Uber board, which is highly dysfunctional and trying to steer the company out of its current struggles and toward a new C.E.O. At this point, nothing surprises me about what’s going on over there. But where do you stand on this? This is certainly not common among Silicon Valley company boards, right? Katie: My latest theory is that the whole board loves reporters very much and has fabricated this complete meltdown because they want to give us the gift of many headlines. Mike: It’s like Christmas in summertime! Katie: Barring that, we’re seeing a pretty much unprecedented board implosion. One thing that hasn’t been touched on much is that Uber, valued at $70 billion, has been the poster child for staying private for as long as possible. We sort of forget that being public also imposes operational discipline and rigor on management teams that, hopefully, curbs some of the behaviors that got Uber to this point. I think Bill Gurley, one of Uber’s ex-board members, wrote about the benefits of going public in one of his great blog posts. But then he was totally ignored by one of his most prominent founders and had to sue that founder to make the same point, so he’s been too busy to write a follow-up. Mike: Indeed! Lastly, we have to talk about the thing that has completely overtaken Silicon Valley’s consciousness: The infamous “Google manifesto.” If you haven’t been paying attention, last weekend a Google employee’s 10-page memo on Google culture went viral internally and created quite a controversy with some of its assertions, which included specious reasoning around why women were not as prevalent in engineering positions at the company. Cut to a few days later, when Google fired him for breaking some of its policies with the text. Almost instantaneously, the guy was embraced by the alt-right, which harped on the idea that James Damore, the employee in question, was being unfairly silenced by a liberal tech company. The way this played out has been extraordinary and yet predictable, a narrative in which corporate culture has been highly politicized because of the current divisive tenor of American cultural discourse. I’m just curious for your perspective on it, and where you think it may head from here. Katie: Damore put forth that there are biological reasons for there being fewer women in the tech industry, and argued that Google itself is not being honest if it pursues gender parity and doesn’t acknowledge these biological factors. But he tried to protect this argument — the sort of thing that would have caused a meltdown if it had been directed at ethnic minorities — and wrapped it in another argument: that tech is so liberal it can’t hear dissenting opinions. The maneuver immediately positioned him as a victim and aimed to shield him from being held accountable for his words. His being fired was a big lesson that free speech is not the same thing as free speech without consequences. One of the things that has made this company-specific debate go national is the fact that Silicon Valley has long held itself apart from the rest of the country, exempt from the things that trouble other places. People here proudly say that they live in a bubble, that they’re out of touch with the rest of the country and that they “live in the future.” And Google is the Silicon Valley standard-bearer. But here we are in 2017, with culture wars engulfing politics, education, health care and religion, and Silicon Valley is not exempt. Mike: Who’d have thought we’re just like other people? Well, maybe not Farhad. Thanks, Katie, see you soon. Katie: Bye!",0.1278689655172414,0.07489045317709112
44,Grandpa Had a Pension. This Generation Has Cryptocurrency.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/style/what-is-cryptocurrency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-08-03T20:18:38+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Most readers have probably heard of Bitcoin, the digital coin that dominates the cryptocurrency market. It has gained notice both because of its skyrocketing value (from less than a cent in early 2010 to around $2,600 currently) and because it is frequently a key player in hacking- and black-market-related stories, from the looting of nearly half a billion dollars in coins from the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014 to the recent demand for payment in Bitcoin in the WannaCry ransomware attack. (For the uninitiated, here is a useful primer on Bitcoin.) But do you know Ethereum, with a total value of coins in circulation of close to $20 billion? Bitcoin Cash, which split off from the original Bitcoin on Aug. 1, lost about half its value within hours, then nearly quadrupled by the next day? Or, rounding out the Big Four, Ripple — whose currency is known as XRP — which shot up to about 40 cents by mid-May from less than a cent at the end of March? (Full disclosure: I owned but unloaded three of these currencies before writing this article.) Then there are over 800 lower-value and often creatively named coins among those listed on Coinmarketcap.com. One can buy FedoraCoin (its jaunty symbol being the Justin Timberlake-approved hat), CannabisCoin (one guess what it looks like) or, to choose one of many bringing up the rear, Quartz, currently priced around three-thousandths of a cent. (Bad news for those who bought it at just under $2 at the end of May.) After years as a niche market for technologically sophisticated anarchists and libertarians excited about a decentralized financial network not under government control, digital coins may be on the verge of going mainstream. “It’s the wild, wild West,” said Ron Ginn, 35, founder of a private photo-sharing service called Text Event Pics in St. Augustine, Fla., who has taken all his money out of the stock market and put it into Ripple and real estate. “This is like getting to invest in the internet in the ’90s. I’m obviously very bullish, but I expect to make a couple million dollars off very little money. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Finance is getting its internet.” Cryptocurrency has understandable appeal to millennials who came of age during the 2008 financial crisis and are now watching the rise of antiglobalist populism threaten the stability of the international economy. “There’s a low cost for entry, you don’t pay a lot of fees and millennials are the most tech-savvy,” said John Guarco, 22, a recent Duke graduate living on Staten Island who, like most of the people interviewed for this article, asked that names of the coins in which he has invested not be published for fear of being targeted by hackers. Unlike previous generations, many of these greenhorn investors don’t have pensions or 401(k)’s, are mistrustful of socking money away in mutual funds and are fully accustomed to owning digital assets that have no concrete properties. As traditional paths to upper-middle-class stability are being blocked by debt, exorbitant housing costs and a shaky job market, these investors view cryptocurrency not only as a hedge against another Dow Jones crash, but also as the most rational — and even utopian — means of investing their money. Sebastian Dinges, 33, the director of operations for Cheeky, a company that makes mealtime products, started his first job after college in 2007. Once he had enough money to invest in the stock market, he said, he “wanted to be risky and get a big return.” Within six months, the market crashed. “So there’s definitely disillusionment,” he said. The majority of Mr. Dinges’s holdings are now in cryptocurrency. His skepticism of traditional markets is shared by a number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts in his age bracket who have observed the recent political and economic upheavals. “I do feel we’ve reached a new level where nobody knows what’s going to happen,” said Gabe Wax, 24, who runs the Rare Book Room recording studio in Brooklyn. “The things we’ve been able to rely on aren’t as reliable and we have a president who knows absolutely nothing about how the economy works, and he’s appointed people who have twisted views about how it works. That, more than anything, is what scares me.” Mr. Wax was still in high school when the 2008 crisis unfolded, but he was paying attention to the headlines. So was Mr. Guarco, who said cryptocurrency was a “safeguard against the volatility in the rest of the world.” “Investing in cryptocurrencies is a hedge,” he continued. “We’re entering a period of long-term deregulation and tax cuts to the wealthiest. It’s not the best recipe for stability.” Mr. Wax also invests in cryptocurrency to shore up his finances as a freelancer in the precarious music industry. “I constantly feel like I’m looking over the edge of a cliff,” he said. “I don’t like the idea of money just sitting in a savings account — with the way inflation works and how low interest rates are, you’re losing money. There’s less money than there’s ever been in the history of recorded music, so that gives me anxiety. It’s weird to say that owning cryptocurrency soothes that anxiety, because it’s counterintuitive, but it does.” He is far from the only one hoping cryptocurrency will assuage his financial worries. Internet forums and Twitter accounts devoted to the subject abound with speculators who view digital coins as a lottery ticket, forecasting “moonshots” with, perhaps, irrational exuberance. For office drudges, the underemployed or those crushed by college loans, the slim chance that a $100 investment may someday reap close to $100 million — as would have happened with an investment of that amount in Bitcoin in 2010 — is too enticing to pass up. But there are plenty of dissenters who are less sanguine about the future of cryptocurrency, arguing that we are in the midst of the biggest bubble yet, fueled by speculative trading in Japan and South Korea, and pointing to previous Bitcoin crashes as justification for their skepticism. Nevertheless, it’s not just twentysomethings in the gig economy who are losing faith in traditional investment tools. Mr. Ginn quit working at Fidelity Investments the day before the market crash in 2008. “It’s not investing,” he said of his old job. “It’s just sticking money somewhere. The investment advisory industry has to give out watered-down, averaged-out advice. When you get into mutual funds, you lose a lot of the ability to beat the markets.” Tom Berg, 44, a founder of BloKtek Capital in Northbrook, Ill., which invests in digital currencies and assets, said: “I got out of the stock market years ago. “My personal opinion was I’m not going to fight for 2 or 3 percent. It’s a conservative place.” By contrast, digital currencies — his preferred term to cryptocurrency, which he says carries the stigma of black-market money laundering — have disrupted the internet and created a major opportunity for those willing to jump in early, Mr. Berg believes. “At first it was an internet of information,” he said. “Then it evolved to an internet of things — social media, I can buy this, I can sell stuff. Now it’s the internet of value.” In his view, cryptocurrency left the “dark ages” six months ago, when it was still the domain of “a lot of people who believed in anarchy.” He thinks that cryptocurrency is a good five years from going mainstream and that the bubble will burst some time after that, at which point he will sell his assets. “If my landscaper ever asks me about crypto, that’s the day I get out,” he said. There are some barriers to mass popularity. Investors must have enough familiarity with and trust of the internet to send money through a cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase or Poloniex. Some of the exchanges also have elaborate and slow identity-verification processes, and certain states do not permit users to invest on them yet. But it’s continually getting easier, and various exchanges allow credit cards for speedy purchases. Once one has bought digital coins, the threat of hacking remains a serious concern. Even users savvy enough to use two-factor authentication on their phones may not have the know-how to set up “cold storage,” or a system of storing coins offline (such as on a computer or dedicated piece of hardware not connected to the internet). There is no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insuring lost money; once it’s gone, it’s gone. Assuming one’s money is protected, there are, of course, the standard risks of investing, amplified by the volatility of cryptocurrency. It’s common for a coin to fluctuate double-digit percentages within a day, often because of “pump-and-dump” techniques from coordinated users trying to manipulate prices in completely unregulated free markets. For this reason, none of the investors I spoke with engage in short-term trading but instead choose, in the online parlance of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to “hodl” (a misppelling of “hold” on a 2013 Bitcoin forum that came to mean “hold on for dear life” rather than sell off for temporary gains). Mr. Dinges and his wife recently bought a house in Los Angeles, but he didn’t use his Bitcoins to help with the renovations. “This is a great opportunity to pull it out and put it toward fixing the house,” he said, “but the future potential is not worth it.” Mr. Berg would agree, advising BloKtek Capital clients to “set it and forget it” and not fall prey to the temptation to make short-term transactions. “My wife and I use it as our bank account,” he said. “Every paycheck, we put a percentage into long-term holdings. We do not expect to become rich overnight. That’s a way to become very poor in one hour.” (Though his wife works at his company, it bears mentioning here that the vast majority of cryptocurrency investors seem to be male, and their Twitter discourse tends to be less than refined, with insults often lodged at devotees of rival currencies.) Even those in it for the long haul, however, admit to monitoring the prices compulsively, scratching the gambler’s itch. “If I have a moment where the price has left my mind, I’ll want to reinsert it,” Mr. Wax, the record producer, said. “I check it as much as any social media. It’s become as distracting as anything else on my phone.” As he works in the cryptocurrency world, Mr. Berg maintains an even more observant — and most likely exhausting — regimen. “I’m always watching the markets,” he said. “The saying is, ‘Crypto never sleeps.’ It’s 24/7, it’s global, it doesn’t have a stock market, it doesn’t have a bell. “I sleep about four hours a day.” Beyond its potential long-term financial rewards, many holders of cryptocurrency view it as a vehicle for social change. While many coins have no value beyond serving as a potential alternative currency, or began as larks that have since been popularized by speculators (such as Dogecoin, whose logo is an internet-meme dog and which now has a market capitalization of about $200 million), others — namely Ripple and Ethereum — have meaningful real-world utility and are being adopted by banks and financial institutions. “The financial gain is fun, but it’s really about improving the world, improving the financial system, transparency, cost, increased speed,” Mr. Ginn said. “It’s the double-sided tape for society. When financial markets collapse, the tape rips people apart and you have a system collapse. Finance got away with it in ’08; it almost took the world down, and nothing changed.” In lieu of more stringent government oversight, he believes that Ripple can help “reduce systemic risk.” That safety-net altruism drives Yoni Saltzman, 24, who designs robotic mechanisms for aerospace and medical applications. Mr. Saltzman has holdings in four different cryptocurrencies and is working with a small team in New York to develop a digital coin it hopes to introduce within a year. “It’s not just about making money,” he said. “We like the idea of not only changing the world, but saving the world.” This is, of course, the same vaguely idealistic rationale Silicon Valley executives routinely trot out to justify their ventures, not all of which seem especially concerned with the greater good. In the meantime, those who have boarded the crypto-train frequently proselytize to friends and family. Unsurprisingly, they have more luck with their younger peers. Mr. Guarco, the Duke graduate, has persuaded a few friends to take the plunge. His older relatives, however, unaccustomed to coins that one can’t pluck out of a lint-filled pocket, are a harder sell. “They usually respond, ‘Crypto-what?’” he said.",0.10787446808510637,0.047653863866629814

The indictment, which was unsealed in California on Wednesday, gave a long list of illegal activities that the Bitcoin exchange, known as BTC-E, facilitated, including ransomware fraud, identity theft, drug trafficking and public corruption. The Russian man charged in the case, Alexander Vinnik, 37, was arrested in Greece on Tuesday. Mr. Vinnik had “directed and supervised” BTC-E’s operations, according to the indictment, and is said to have had co-conspirators. Criminals who stole or extorted Bitcoin from their victims would transfer the virtual currencies to BTC-E, which would then convert the virtual currency into traditional currency using a host of bank accounts registered under shell companies. Justice Department officials said that the exchange appeared to have been responsible for laundering more than $4 billion for criminals, with most of the money turned into American dollars and Russian rubles. The site served 700,000 customers around the world, the officials said. Users of BTC-E had noted this week that the exchange’s website was down, though the site’s administrators had said on social media that they were working to get it back up. The arrest of Mr. Vinnik came shortly after law enforcement authorities in the United States and Europe took down two big online drug markets in which Bitcoin was the primary currency. Within the Bitcoin community, it has been common knowledge that drug dealers could use BTC-E to turn their Bitcoin proceeds into dollars. The indictment may offer an explanation for a shock to the digital coin market in 2014. Mr. Vinnik and his partners are accused of stealing funds from the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which declared bankruptcy in 2014 after disclosing a hacker intrusion. Mt. Gox’s chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said that year that it had lost more than 800,000 Bitcoins, some of which the company later said it had recovered. The indictment unsealed on Wednesday said that hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins moved from Mt. Gox into accounts at BTC-E that were directly controlled by Mr. Vinnik. The stolen Bitcoins were then moved to a different virtual currency exchange, Bitstamp, and sold for traditional currencies, which were deposited in bank accounts that Mr. Vinnik controlled in Latvia and Cyprus. At least 300,000 Bitcoins followed this path. Those coins would be worth nearly $800 million today. Soon after news of Mr. Vinnik’s arrest became public, WizSec, a Japanese computer security firm that has been tracking the Mt. Gox theft, announced that it had traced the stolen funds to Mr. Vinnik and had provided its findings to law enforcement authorities. WizSec said on Wednesday that the theft of Mt. Gox’s funds began in September 2011 and continued until 2014, with most of the money ending up at BTC-E. The report from WizSec appeared to be the most complete explanation yet of the theft. BTC-E was founded in 2011, just as Bitcoin began to gain significant value for the first time. The identity of the exchange’s operators was kept secret, even as other large Bitcoin exchanges tried to make their businesses more transparent and friendly to regulators. BTC-E announced on its website that the exchange was complying with regulators by collecting identifying documents from all of its customers. In practice, however, BTC-E did not require anything from customers opening a new account, the indictment said. BTC-E customers kept accounts under user names like “CocaineCowbays,” “ISIS” and “dzkillerhacker,” according to the indictment.",-0.07956756756756757,0.030664625664625664

Unfortunately, that effort was caught up in a scandal at an investment fund in Malaysia. Goldman raised more than $6 billion for that fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The money was supposed to benefit the Malaysian public but ended up enriching Goldman and those close to Najib Razak, who was prime minister. In December, the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the firm of violating securities laws there. Those charges come on top of a Justice Department investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars corporations from bribing foreign officials to gain a business advantage. Goldman’s former top banker in Asia, Timothy Leissner, pleaded guilty in August, describing his role in concealing bribes and kickbacks. Charges were also filed against Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner’s former deputy, who is being held in Malaysia pending extradition. The firm initially tried to shake off the charges by claiming that any misconduct was the work of a few rogue employees, but reports that Goldman’s former chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein met with a key figure in the fraud have undercut that defense. Goldman’s chief executive, David M. Solomon, has offered a full-throated defense of the firm. In a message to employees, he wrote: “We believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today.” An American corporation can be prosecuted for the acts of its employees, so Goldman does not have many defenses if prosecutors decide to file charges. Although Goldman has pledged its cooperation, the firm has also claimed that it is innocent of the Malaysian charges and may well be girding for a fight with the Justice Department to limit its liability. Goldman also will have to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, and the Federal Reserve, Goldman’s chief banking regulator. Goldman has little choice but to reach a settlement. The key question is how much its entanglement with 1MDB may cost the firm. Disgorging the $600 million fee it earned for arranging the bond deals is the likely starting point for any resolution in the United States. How much a potential fine could be on top of that is anyone’s guess. One possibility is that it will be a multiple of Goldman’s profit on the transaction. That could push the penalty over a billion dollars, with the possibility of even more if Goldman has to reach an agreement with the Malaysian government. The precipitous fall in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2016 cries out for greater regulation to protect investors. Studies have shown that the market for cryptocurrencies is subject to widespread manipulation, which puts smaller investors at the mercy of those who are trying to profit from the price swings. Two bills were introduced in Congress in December to address manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Neither offers a concrete step toward regulating trading platforms, nor do they designate oversight to a single agency. As investors have suffered losses, the questions have increased about whether cryptocurrencies will survive as a viable investment class. Without greater government oversight to curb manipulation, the interest of small investors may well dry up. Control of the House means Democrats can investigate actions by the Trump administration, and perhaps the president himself. The subpoenas for documents and testimony are likely to fly up Pennsylvania Avenue in much the way they did during the Obama administration after Republicans took control of Congress. But those hoping for a cascade of materials from the Trump administration may be disappointed. Congressional investigations may well run into claims of executive privilege, something previous administrations have used to resist demands for information. That means any dispute of what must be produced will be decided in the federal courts under the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Nixon, the Watergate case that found the judiciary has final authority to determine the scope of any claim of privilege. That is not a very expeditious route for a congressional committee to pursue. Any decision is likely to take months. Add to that the likelihood of an appeal, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, and it may take two or more years to adjudicate a privilege claim. In August, President Trump tweeted that he wanted the S.E.C. to change the requirements for companies to issue financial statements from each quarter to twice a year. Publicly traded companies complain that the quarterly reporting requirement feeds into the short-term mentality of the securities markets. The S.E.C. issued a request for comments on Dec. 18 about “the nature, content and timing of earnings releases and quarterly reports.” Asking for comments is a sure way to slow-walk any potential changes. Reuters reported that some Republicans are frustrated that Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has not pushed a deregulatory agenda as aggressively as expected and sided with the two Democrats on the commission with some regularity. Could dissatisfaction with Mr. Clayton cause Congress to take the lead on making major changes to the reporting obligations of companies? Larger companies are unlikely to see any significant alteration of their quarterly reporting obligations, but smaller companies — which have a broad appeal on Capitol Hill — may see a change in the frequency and scope of their reporting. The question is whether that will be a positive change for the markets. Less reporting, especially by smaller companies, could allow companies to push the envelope in their financial disclosures and help them avoid, at least for a while, their day of reckoning. With the stock market declining sharply in December and growing concerns about a possible recession, would postponing reporting be good for investors? Corporate America has a strong voice in Washington, so changes in the reporting requirements that put the interests of executives over investors would hardly be surprising. Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year!",0.11180357142857142,0.054712301587301594
47,Some Bitcoin Backers Are Defecting to Create a Rival Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/business/dealbook/bitcoin-cash-split.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-07-25T22:56:26+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — For the last two years, rival factions have been vying for control of the Bitcoin virtual currency and its global network of computers and supporters. Now, one of the main camps is preparing to break off and create a competing version of Bitcoin. A group of investors and entrepreneurs, most of them based in Asia, have announced a plan to create what they are calling Bitcoin Cash, starting next week. The plan would seal a divorce between opponents in a long-simmering feud over what Bitcoin should be — and lead to two competing virtual currencies going by the name of Bitcoin. “I actually think it would be a good thing if there is a split,” said Roger Ver, a Tokyo-based investor who voiced his preliminary support for Bitcoin Cash on Tuesday. He said the differences among the different camps had quite likely grown too stark for them to move forward together. Bitcoin Cash could easily dissolve into irrelevance — the level of support for it is still unclear — but the concrete plans to move forward have underscored, once again, how hard it is to govern a decentralized, open-source technology like Bitcoin with no single set of leaders or ownership. “In the long run it will be forced to develop some real political structure to take these kinds of decisions, but it just isn’t there yet, so the result has been chaos,” said Joseph Bonneau, who has studied Bitcoin and is a fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which describes itself as a nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech and innovation. The Bitcoin divide is part of a wider splintering of the world that has sprung up around virtual currencies. Many people who initially got excited about the unique technology behind Bitcoin have taken advantage of the public, open-source nature of the technology and created their own new virtual currencies, like Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. These other systems run according to different rules than Bitcoin, with some emphasizing more speed and complexity, and some more focused on anonymity and security. The divisions have, if anything, increased the excitement and the value of all the virtual currencies in the world — and banks and governments have announced their own projects to harness the technology. The price of Bitcoin has recently been at record highs, near $3,000, and several other coins have grown to be worth billions of dollars on their own. A whole class of companies have raised money in recent months by creating and selling their own new digital tokens. Until now, though, Bitcoin has remained the most valuable digital token of them all, and it has kept its followers united by a single set of rules, despite all the warring behind the scenes. The divisions, though, appear to have grown too stark to keep everyone on the same blockchain, as the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions is known. Mr. Ver has been one of the leaders of a contingent that has long wanted to change the rules governing the Bitcoin network so that it can handle more transactions and compete with the likes of PayPal and Visa. Bitcoin Cash is set to increase the limit on the number of transactions that can be processed by the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes. Currently, the network can process only blocks of transactions that are smaller than one megabyte, which allows for roughly five transactions in a second. The move to increase the size of the so-called blocks, though, has run up against intense opposition from the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software. These programmers, known as the core developers, have said that increasing the amount of data included in each block of transactions would make it harder for individual users to process the blocks and easier for a small number of companies to take control of the Bitcoin network. “It destroys the Bitcoin ethos, which is open and permissionless, where nobody is telling you what to do,” said Samson Mow, the chief strategy officer at Blockstream, a company that employs some of the most prominent core developers. The core developers have come up with their own solution to increase the number of transactions flowing through the system with software known as Segregated Witness, or SegWit. Mr. Ver and others, though, have said SegWit does not expand Bitcoin fast enough to keep up with its recent growth in popularity. The arguments have given way to vicious mudslinging and hacking attacks against the leaders on both sides, leading some prominent developers to leave the project. Proponents of increasing the block size, like Mr. Ver, have put forward proposals in the past that have failed to garner majority support in the community, in part because of concerns about the sophistication of the programmers working on the projects. But the big block camp has not, until now, announced a definite plan to split off from the rest of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin Cash will not exist until next week, a small number of exchanges have begun trading futures contracts, tied to the expected price of Bitcoin Cash. On Tuesday, it was trading around $450, or a fraction of the $2,600 value of an ordinary Bitcoin. As recently as last week, it appeared that the major Bitcoin players had found a compromise that would avert a split in the network, or a fork as it is known in Bitcoin world. Many of the largest Bitcoin companies agreed in May that they would install the SegWit software the core developers created, while also moving toward a doubling of the size of each block of transactions, to two megabytes, in November. The largest Bitcoin processors had signaled last week that they intended to begin running the new software on Aug. 1. But the developers have suggested that they do not intend to move forward with any increase in the size of the blocks in the coming months. One of Mr. Ver’s many investment holdings, Bitcoin.com, announced on Tuesday that it would put all of its resources behind Bitcoin Cash if the block size has not been doubled by November. To gain traction more broadly, Bitcoin Cash will have to win backing from the broader community of so-called Bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners are best known for using specialized computers to unlock, or mine, new Bitcoins. But miners also process Bitcoin transactions and have voting power over any changes to the Bitcoin network in direct proportion to the amount of computing power they dedicate to the network. Most of the largest mining operations are now in China, thanks to the availability of cheap hardware and electricity. One significant Chinese mining operation, ViaBTC, has been an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin Cash and has said it will begin backing the system next week. The largest Bitcoin mining operator in the world, a company known as Bitmain, is a primary investor in ViaBTC. That has led many in the Bitcoin world to expect that Bitmain will also provide backing to Bitcoin Cash. But Bitmain has so far said only that it does not “rule out” supporting Bitcoin Cash. When Bitcoin Cash comes into existence, every current holder of Bitcoins will have access to an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash, but from that point forward the two systems will diverge. In the coming weeks, Bitcoin enthusiasts on all sides of the debate will be watching closely to see which big Bitcoin companies offer support for people who want to hold, trade and mine Bitcoin Cash.",0.18062448979591836,0.11090312748476015
48,"AlphaBay, Biggest Online Drug Bazaar, Goes Dark, and Questions Swirl",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/business/dealbook/alphabay-online-drug-bazaar-goes-dark.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-07-06T23:20:11+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The largest online black market for drugs, AlphaBay, has been down for nearly two days, raising questions about whether it was seized by law enforcement authorities or taken down in a swindle. The administrators of AlphaBay have posted on the social network Reddit that they are doing maintenance and that the site should be up again soon. But those messages were posted long after AlphaBay went down on Tuesday, leading to rampant speculation among its users. The site is one of many so-called dark net markets that came into existence after American authorities took down the first and most famous such market, the Silk Road, in 2013. AlphaBay has come under scrutiny most recently because of the many vendors who use it to sell the deadly synthetic opioids at the center of the nation’s overdose crisis. The site is also used as a marketplace for stolen credit cards and other financial data. Researchers say that AlphaBay has grown into the largest black market site by far. The site was hosting $600,000 to $800,000 in transactions daily earlier this year, according to unpublished statistics from Nicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has written many papers about the scale of such sites. Those figures would make AlphaBay about twice as large as the Silk Road when it was shut down in October 2013. Operators of other large black market sites have absconded with user deposits and shut the sites, in what are known as exit scams. In some cases, the authorities, in so-called honeypot operations, have taken down black market sites, then reopened them to get more information about users. Federal authorities have not commented on, or taken responsibility for, AlphaBay’s being down. When the authorities took down the Silk Road they quickly put up a banner on the site alerting users to the operation. AlphaBay users have flocked to Reddit to speculate about what happened and express concern about their drug supplies and deposits on the site. “At least if it was a verified exit scam people could write off their btc as gone and plan accordingly,” one user wrote, using an abbreviation for Bitcoin. “I think it’s not not knowing that drives so many people crazy.” The speculation escalated after Canadian news media reported on a raid and arrests in Quebec that were said to target people involved in online black markets. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AlphaBay and other sites have gone offline before because of maintenance problems and attacks by hackers, and have then come back online. One of AlphaBay’s longtime administrators, who uses the screen name trappy_AB, wrote on Reddit that that was the case this week. “I have been in touch with our devs and admins and they are working to restore AlphaBay as soon as possible,” he wrote, using shorthand terms for developers and administrators. Users were skeptical about why the site’s administrators had been so late in posting information. “Telling us 1 minute after it goes down would be fine. It literally took him like 28hrs,” a user named yellow_viper wrote on Reddit. AlphaBay is only accessible through dark web browsers, which scramble the location of users and site operators, making it all but impossible for the authorities to identify the whereabouts of the servers hosting a specific site. Users pay for goods with virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which cannot be easily tracked by financial institutions or law enforcement. The authorities took down the Silk Road because its creator, Ross Ulbricht, accidentally revealed his real email address in an early online post about the site. Mr. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence in prison for his role as the kingpin of the worldwide digital drug-trafficking enterprise. AlphaBay operates much like eBay, hosting vendors who offer their wares and pay a commission to the site on each purchase. Customers deposit money with the site before making purchases. This is the money the operators could have stolen. In 2015, the operators of the marketplace known as Evolution closed the site and took millions of dollars of users’ money. Other sites have been taken down by law enforcement agencies in various countries using sophisticated techniques to unmask the operators’ anonymity. In recent months, authorities in the United States have arrested several large vendors on AlphaBay who had sold synthetic opioids like fentanyl and U-47700. In April, police arrested a couple in Greenville, S.C., who were allegedly connected to a popular vendor on AlphaBay known as PeterTheGreat. An 18-year-old in Portland, Ore., died after taking U-47700 that she bought from PeterTheGreat on AlphaBay, the authorities said. When large dark net markets have gone down in the past, the transactions have quickly moved to other sites. AlphaBay currently has many large competitors, including sites like Valhalla and Dream Market. Luke Rodeheffer, a cybercrime analyst with Flashpoint, said that criminals around the web were buzzing about the problems at AlphaBay. “Given that a number of Eastern European cybercriminals use AlphaBay as a marketplace, the down status is already being discussed on top-tier Russian forums,” he said. “No one has any particular insights into the cause,” he added.",-0.09765365853658536,0.010433965365730753
49,Easiest Path to Riches on the Web? An Initial Coin Offering,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/business/dealbook/coin-digital-currency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-06-24T01:08:55+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A new crop of technology entrepreneurs is forgoing the usual routes to raising money. The entrepreneurs are not pitching venture capitalists, selling stock in an initial public offering or using crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter. Instead, before they even have a working product, they are creating their own digital currencies and selling so-called coins on the web, sometimes raising tens of millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. The pitch is that once the products are up and running, the currencies — with names like BAT, Mysterium and Siacoin — will be redeemable for services like data storage or anonymous internet access, and could appreciate in value in the meantime. Known as initial coin offerings, this latest twist in online fund-raising has made it easier than ever for entrepreneurs to raise large sums of money without dealing with the hassles of regulators, investor protections or accountants. Since the beginning of the year, 65 projects have raised $522 million in these offerings, according to Smith & Crown, a research firm focused on the new industry. It is a frothy, sprawling and completely unregulated way of funding start-ups, leaving even veteran technology watchers scratching their heads. “It’s kind of like when you are a little kid and you know you are getting away with something,” said Chris Burniske, an industry analyst at ARK Invest. “It’s not going to last forever, but it’s fun in the interim. The space is giddy right now.” Last month, a small team of computer engineers in Lithuania raised $14 million in 45 minutes by selling a coin, known as Mysterium, that is intended to give access to an encrypted online data service that is still being built. The next day, a group of coders in the Bay Area pulled in $35 million in under 30 seconds of online fund-raising. The coders were offering Basic Attention Tokens, which will one day work on a new kind of ad-free web browser. Then this week, a team in Switzerland raised around $100 million for a coin that will be used on an online chat program that has not yet been released, known as Status. Proponents of initial coin offerings hail them as a financial innovation that empowers developers and gives early investors a chance to share in the profits of a successful new enterprise. But where some see a new method of crowdfunding online projects, critics say the phenomenon is ripe for abuse and, in many cases, a violation of American securities law. “It’s exploitative and abusive of the investing public,” Preston Byrne, a technology lawyer specializing in virtual currencies, said about the offerings. Last year, the first blockbuster coin offering, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, quickly raised more than $150 million. But the project blew up after a hacker manipulated the code and stole more than $50 million worth of digital currency. A number of other projects since then have been labeled scams. Even among supporters, many say there has been too much money pouring into unproven projects in recent months. Fred Wilson, a founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, said he was “long term very bullish” on these new digital currencies. But he said, “We see many reasons to be cautious right now.” “There is a gold rush mentality in the sector right now and many people are doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons,” he said. Underpinning the surge in initial coin offerings is a broader boom in digital money. Bitcoin and Ether, two of the most popular virtual currencies, have soared in value in recent months. And when entrepreneurs sell new coins, they are asking for payment in Bitcoin or Ether, not United States dollars. This means that conventional banks and financial institutions are essentially shut out, allowing initial coin offerings to take place beyond the control of regulators. Among the people tossing their money into the pot is Pete Sussman, 27, a software developer at a St. Louis company called Fusion Marketing. Mr. Sussman began with around $800 worth of Bitcoin, which he earned selling art and blog posts online. He used his Bitcoin first to invest in a project called BitShares. Then he bought into the Ethereum virtual currency, Ether. As the value of Ether soared over the last year, Mr. Sussman got a return of 1,000 percent on his original money. In March, he used his Ether to buy a new virtual currency known as GNT, which was created as part of a project known as Golem, based in Poland. The value of GNT has jumped 3,000 percent in recent months, pushing the value of Mr. Sussman’s digital currency to over $200,000. Along with GNT, other new tokens including Ark, Antshares and Spectrecoin have appreciated by more than 6,000 percent since they were issued. Mr. Sussman has also had some bad moments along the way, such as the time that he sent what would now be $100,000 worth of Ether to a scammer who put up a fake digital address for another coin offering. “I was at work. I went to the bathroom and I tried to throw up but nothing came out,” Mr. Sussman said. “Then after a little bit, I went home and sulked.” When he told his co-workers about the experience, they did not warn him off the investments. Instead, they became excited about the trend. Now, half a dozen of his colleagues, including his boss, have a chat room where they discuss potential coin investments. The projects selling coins come in several forms. Some are straightforward start-ups that design their coins like stock, with promised dividend payments if the company does well. Others are Bitcoin or Ethereum knockoffs, which the inventors sell in advance before launching to the public. But most of the prominent projects are not traditional start-ups. Instead, the programmers are building online services similar to Wikipedia, which are intended to be open source and owned by no one. The coins will become the internal payment method on these services once they are built — paying for computing power in the case of Golem, or file storage with a project called Storj. The sale of the coins will be used to compensate the programmers. Even some well-established Silicon Valley names are using coins to raise funds. Brendan Eich, a co-founder of the Mozilla web browser project, is developing a new browser called Brave. It was Mr. Eich who raised $35 million in just 30 seconds by selling millions of Basic Attention Tokens, or BAT, in late May. People using the Brave browser will be able to use their BAT to view web pages ad-free, and companies will be able to pay viewers for looking at ads. (The New York Times and other publishers have called Brave’s ad-blocking technology illegal.) The hope with a token like BAT is that as more people use the browser and more advertisers want the coins, the coins will become more sought after and the users will benefit from the rising price. These so-called network effects can also encourage users to get their friends to use a service. Mr. Eich said he was anticipating that all the people holding tokens “will drive millions of users to join our ecosystem.” That is the dream. For now, several projects are raising millions without even having any computer code to test. And because of the lack of investor protections, the projects remain vulnerable to the whims of entrepreneurs, who could run away with their quick hauls of digital currency. The most immediate problems could arise if regulators decide that the tokens being sold are unregistered securities, a violation of the law. An official with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested at a conference last month that the agency was aware of the potential for problems and was looking at the market. For at least some investors, such as Mr. Sussman, the possibility of big losses is the flip side of the big gains, and part of the allure. “It’s very Wild West,” he said. “It’s very easy to get into a situation where you can send things to a scammer very easily, and there is no recourse for it. That’s kind of the beauty of it, too.”",0.11520422535211267,0.10343266670731457
50,"Move Over, Bitcoin. Ether Is the Digital Currency of the Moment.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/business/dealbook/ethereum-bitcoin-digital-currency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-06-19T19:11:34+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The price of Bitcoin has hit record highs in recent months, more than doubling in price since the start of the year. Despite these gains, Bitcoin is on the verge of losing its position as the dominant virtual currency. The value of Ether, the digital money that lives on an upstart network known as Ethereum, has risen an eye-popping 4,500 percent since the beginning of the year. With the recent price increases, the outstanding units of the Ether currency were worth around $34 billion as of Monday — or 82 percent as much as all the Bitcoin in existence. At the beginning of the year, Ether was only about 5 percent as valuable as Bitcoin. The sudden rise of Ethereum highlights how volatile the bewildering world of virtual currency remains, where lines of computer code can be spun into billions of dollars in a matter of months. Bitcoin, the breakout digital currency, is also hitting new highs — one Bitcoin was worth $2,600 on Monday. But the Bitcoin community has struggled with technical issues and bitter internal divisions among its biggest supporters. It has also been tainted by its association with online drug sales and hackers demanding ransom. Against this backdrop, Ether has been gaining steam. The two-year old system has picked up backing from both tech geeks and big corporate names like JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft, which are excited about Ethereum’s goal of providing not only a digital currency but also a new type of global computing network, which generally requires Ether to use. In a recent survey of 1,100 virtual currency users, 94 percent were positive about the state of Ethereum, while only 49 percent were positive about Bitcoin, the industry publication CoinDesk said this month. If recent trends continue, the value of Ethereum’s virtual currency could race past Bitcoin’s in the coming weeks. Virtual currency fanatics are monitoring the value of each and waiting for the two currencies to switch place, a moment that has been called “the flippening.” “The momentum has shifted to Ethereum — there is no doubt about that,” said William Mougayar, the founder of Virtual Capital Ventures, which invests in a variety of virtual currencies and start-ups. “There is almost nothing you can do with Bitcoin that you can’t do with Ethereum.” Even though most of the people buying Ether and Bitcoin are individual investors, the gains that both have experienced have taken what was until very recently a quirky fringe experiment into the realm of big money. The combined value of all Ether and Bitcoin is now worth more than the market value of PayPal and is approaching the size of Goldman Sachs. Investors buying Ether are placing a bet that people will want to use the Ethereum network’s computing capabilities and will need the currency to do so. But that is far from a sure thing. And real-world use of the network is still scant. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has made inroads into mainstream commerce, with companies like Overstock.com and Expedia accepting Bitcoin for purchases, along with the black-market operators who use the currency. The fact that there are fewer real-world uses for Ethereum has many market experts expecting a crash similar to the ones that have followed previous run-ups in the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Even during recent pullbacks, though, the value of Ether has generally continued to gain on Bitcoin in relative terms. Ethereum was launched in the middle of 2015 by a 21-year-old college dropout, Vitalik Buterin, who was born in Russia and raised in Canada. He now lists his residence, jokingly, as Cathay Pacific Airlines because of his travel schedule. The Ether he holds has made him a millionaire many times over, but he has generally avoided commenting on the price increase in Ether. Mr. Buterin was inspired by Bitcoin, and the software he built shares some of the same basic qualities. Both are hosted and maintained by the computers of volunteers around the world, who are rewarded for their participation with the new digital tokens that are released onto the network each day. Because the virtual currencies are tracked and maintained by a network of computers, no government or company is in charge. The prices of both Bitcoin and Ether are established on private exchanges, where people can sell the tokens they own at the going market price. But Ethereum was designed to do much more than just serve as a digital money. The network of computers hooked into Ethereum can be harnessed to do computational work, essentially making it possible to run computer programs on the network, or what are referred to as decentralized applications, or Dapps. This has led to an enormous community of programmers working on the software. One of the first applications to take off was a user-led venture capital fund of sorts, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. After raising over $150 million last summer, the project crashed and burned, and appeared ready to take Ethereum with it. But the way that Mr. Buterin and other developers dealt with the problems, returning the hacked Ether to users, won him the respect of many in the corporate world. “It was good to see that there is governance on Ethereum and that they can fix issues in a timely manner if they have to,” said Eric Piscini, who leads the team looking into virtual currency technology at the consulting firm Deloitte. Many applications being built on Ethereum are also raising money using the Ether currency, in what are known as initial coin offerings, a play on initial public offerings. Start-ups that have followed this path have generally collected Ether from investors and exchanged them for units of their own specialized virtual currency, leaving the entrepreneurs with the Ether to convert into dollars and spend on operational expenses. These coin offerings, which have proliferated in recent months, have created a surge of demand for the Ether currency. Just last week, investors sent $150 million worth of Ether to a start-up, Bancor, that wants to make it easier to launch virtual currencies. If projects like Bancor stumble, Ether could as well. Several big companies have also been building programs on top of Ethereum, including the mining company BHP Billiton, which has built a trial program to track its raw materials, and JPMorgan, which is working on a system to monitor trading. Over the last few months, over 100 companies have joined the nonprofit Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, including global names like Toyota, Merck and Samsung, to build tools that will make Ethereum useful in corporate settings. Many of the companies using Ethereum are building their own private versions of the software, which won’t make use of the Ether currency. Speculators are betting that these companies will eventually plug their software into the broader Ethereum network. There is, though, also the possibility that none of these big trials come to fruition, and the current excitement fizzles out, as has happened many times in the past with Bitcoin after big price surges. “I hope this is the year where we start to close the gap between the speculative value and the actual value,” Mr. Mougayar said. “There is a lot at stake right now.”",0.20586666666666664,0.08812149451855335

To kick off things, Shawn Cook from San Diego asked a question about Bitcoin.

His hipster friend is constantly bugging him to invest in the cryptocurrency. It’s making Shawn wonder: Should he ditch his boring old index fund? Shawn, this is a great question because who among us doesn’t have a hipster friend who is always talking about how he is killing it with his investments in Bitcoin, Apple and Tesla? Those people have all the fun! They seem to know exactly what’s going to happen in whatever market they’re investing in and have this aura of self-assurance that is really annoying. It’s enough to cause even the most rational, non-hip among us to doubt our boring, old-style investing. In fact, I remember feeling a bit this way back in 1999. I was surrounded by tech people with their BlackBerries and Hotmail accounts. I resisted the siren call of the Nasdaq and the technology bubble — until I finally gave in. Then, I took some hard-earned money out of a boring diversified investment and bought Infospace. Remember that? If you do, it may not be pleasant. In fact, I can’t remember the exact details because they’re too painful, but I know I invested a lot of money (for me) back then. When I sold, I didn’t have enough to pay for a burrito and a Coke. I even considered buying more on “the dip.” Except I didn’t have any more money to invest, and this wasn’t a dip. The stock never recovered to anything close to what I had paid to buy it. Today, I still have the stock certificate as a reminder of that valuable lesson. So, Shawn, the moral of the story is that your friend just might be right. But then again, he might be flat-out wrong. What he is talking about is speculation at best, and it’s probably closer to gambling. If you have some spare money and you feel like gambling, fire away. But here’s an alternative idea. Keep your low-cost, boring, diversified investments, and have a T-shirt made (black, with white text) that says: “I own Bitcoin. How you like me now?” I’ll even provide the sketch. Keep the questions coming via your voice messages!",0.038764000000000014,0.01560822510822511

What he initially thought was just a kink in his computer’s software was in fact part of a global ransomware attack that has affected more than 200,000 computers and caused untold havoc from China to Britain. Now, Mr. Gren and the thousands of other victims worldwide face an agonizing choice: either hand over the ransom — a figure that has climbed to $600 for each affected machine — by a deadline this Friday, or potentially lose their digital information, including personal photos, hospital patient records and other priceless data, forever. “I’m pretty devastated,” said Mr. Gren, 32, a manager of an online entertainment business in Krakow, Poland, who has spent almost all of his waking hours since Friday looking for ways to reclaim his digital data. “I’ve lost private files that I have no other way of recovering. For me, the damage has been huge.” That decision has become even more difficult as cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned people against paying the ransom ahead of this week’s deadline. Aside from dissuading victims from handing over money that may help fund further such attacks, they caution that it is not guaranteed the attackers will return control of people’s computers even if they pay the assailants in bitcoin, a digital currency favored in such ransomware attacks that can be difficult to trace. Officials also note that the attackers, who have yet to been named, have provided only three bitcoin addresses — similar to a traditional bank routing number — for all global victims to deposit the ransom, so it may prove difficult to know who has paid the digital fees. This haphazard planning has led many victims to hold off paying, at least until they can guarantee they will get their data back. So far, roughly $80,000 has been deposited into the bitcoin addresses linked to the attack, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, has confirmed that some of the 200 individuals that it had identified, who had paid the ransom, had successfully had their files decrypted. Yet that represented a small fraction of those affected, and the company said it still remained unlikely that people would regain control of their computers if they paid the online fee. The tally of ransom payments may rise ahead of Friday’s deadline, but cybersecurity experts say the current numbers — both total ransom money paid and machines decrypted — are far short of early estimates forecasting that the digital attack may eventually cost victims hundreds of millions of dollars in combined ransom fees. “I predict this may be an epic failure,” said Kim Peretti, a former senior litigator in the Department of Justice’s computer crime and intellectual property division who now is co-chairwoman of the cybersecurity preparedness and response team at Alston & Bird, an international law firm. “Because of the publicity of this attack and the public’s awareness of people potentially not getting their files back, the figures aren’t as high as people had first thought.” For victims of such attacks, the potential loss of personal or business files can be traumatic. In typical ransomware cases, including the most recent hack, assailants send an encrypted email to potential targets. The message includes a malware attachment that takes over their machines if opened. The attackers then demand payment before returning control of the computers, often through money paid into bitcoin or other largely untraceable online currencies. The latest ransomware strike, experts said, was particularly virulent because it was based on malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency. Law enforcement agencies from the United States, Britain and elsewhere have been tracking the potential culprits, with suspicions now focusing on hackers in North Korea. For Randy Meyers, a technology consultant for a rural hospital in western Texas, the recent ransomware attack has brought back bitter memories. Last month, Mr. Meyers discovered that a similar virus had taken over critical computers at a 25-bed medical facility in Fisher County, roughly a three-hour drive from Fort Worth. The virus locked physicians and other medical staff out of patient records, and his repeated pleas by email to the attackers to unlock the vital machines went unanswered. Eventually, Mr. Meyers brought in cybersecurity experts to crack the malicious software, ensuring that the struggling hospital would not have to pay the roughly $18,000 in bitcoin ransom to retrieve patients’ files. Still, he said, the attack had crippled the hospital for four days, with doctors and nurses resorting to pen and paper. “It’s like going home and finding out you’ve been broken into,” said Mr. Meyers, who said he had never before experienced such an attack in more than 20 years as a technology consultant. “You never want to have to pay the ransom. It gives them a reason to do it again and again.” For some organizations, particularly government agencies, paying to decrypt locked-out computers is not even an option. In many countries, including across Europe and Asia, the payment of any form of ransom is forbidden by laws often written to counter terrorist attacks in the offline world. That means organizations like Britain’s National Health Service, among the worst affected in the recent ransomware attacks, are left with few options to retrieve data that can have life-or-death implications. In the United States, there is no nationwide policy outlawing such ransomware payments. But experts still warn against handing over money because it may lead to far more significant costs down the road. Exclusion and cooperation clauses in many cyberinsurance policies expressly prohibit businesses from paying such digital ransoms without pre-approval. If a victim hands over the money anyway, insurers may cancel a business’s coverage and leave clients paying out of pocket — including covering the cost of disruptions to their businesses, remediation expenses and customer notifications. “In general, the advice is not to pay,” said Kevin Kalinich, a global cyber-risk expert at Aon, the insurance broker. “The perpetrators may not release your data, or you’ll be considered a target for future attacks.” Jorge Reza, a sales manager for a construction business in Laredo, Tex., was forced to take that gamble when the company he works for was hit with a ransomware attack last year. Hours after one of his colleagues was locked out of the business’s main computer, which held company invoices, payroll data and other sensitive information, Mr. Reza, 34, found himself online, researching how to open a bitcoin account and other tips for paying the digital ransom. Despite fears the assailants would not unlock the computer, Mr. Reza uploaded money through Western Union, found someone who would sell him $1,200 worth of bitcoin and waited for notification that the machine had been returned to his control. The process, Mr. Reza said, was both stressful and uncertain, as he could not be sure the attackers would follow through on their promises. Luckily, less than 12 hours after the initial attack, he was able to decrypt his files. “They were digital terrorists, but at least they were honest,” Mr. Reza said. “They were holding our data hostage. What other choice did I have?”",-0.24173076923076928,0.038189102564102566
53,What Is Bitcoin? All About the Mysterious Digital Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/business/all-about-bitcoin-the-mysterious-digital-currency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-05-15T17:49:36+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Here is a look at the basics behind the electronic currency, which has come under recent scrutiny after hackers behind a global ransomware attack demanded payment in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which the Bitcoin digital tokens move. Some people differentiate between Bitcoin capitalized, as the token, and bitcoin lowercase, as the network. Unlike traditional payment networks like Visa or American Express, no single company or person runs the Bitcoin network. Instead, it is a decentralized network of computers around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions, similar to the decentralized network of servers that makes the internet work. Because there is no central authority running Bitcoin, no one has the authority to force new users to reveal their identities. The network was designed this way to create a currency and a financial network outside the control of any government or single company. The computers that join the network and track Bitcoin transactions are motivated to do so by the new coins that are released to the network every 10 minutes and are given to one of the computers helping to track the transactions and maintain the network. The digital currency Bitcoin has emerged as a favorite tool for hackers demanding a ransom for a simple reason: You can start accepting Bitcoin anywhere in the world without having to reveal your identity. For criminals, this makes Bitcoin much more attractive than systems like Western Union, which generally require customers to provide identification before opening an account and receiving transferred money. There are companies in most countries that will sell you Bitcoin in exchange for the local currency. In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for American dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of verification of your identity needed. For people who do not want to reveal their identities, there are services like LocalBitcoins that will connect local people who want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, generally without any verification of identity required. To start accepting Bitcoin is even easier. One needs only to create a Bitcoin address, which can be done anonymously by anyone with internet access. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the network’s public ledger, known as the blockchain. Law enforcement or financial authorities can sometimes use the blockchain to track transactions among criminals. But as long as the criminals do not associate a real-world identity with their Bitcoin address, they are generally safe. Complicating matters further, there are increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin laundering services, known as tumblers, which mix large quantities of transactions together in order to make it harder for the authorities to track the transactions. Where it can get more difficult for hackers is when they want to convert the Bitcoin they have received into a traditional national currency. Most companies that convert Bitcoin to dollars in the United States require that their customers provide identification. If a criminal registered with a company like that, it would be relatively easy for the police to track them down. But there are many Bitcoin exchanges outside the United States that do not require customers to register with a real-world identity. LocalBitcoins also makes it easy to find someone in any city around the world who will meet you in person and pay cash for Bitcoin without requiring any identification — a sort of Craigslist for Bitcoin exchanges. It is also getting easier to buy goods online using Bitcoin, without ever converting the digital currency into dollars or euros. The price of Bitcoin has been rising, and recently hit a high above $2,000. Like gold, the price of Bitcoin has always been driven by the scarcity of the digital tokens. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created. Technology investors have purchased coins and pushed up the price out of a belief that the tokens and the system will be a sort of global digital currency and financial network for the future. While real-world transactions have been slow to take off, Bitcoin has continued to be popular for black market uses like ransomware and online drug markets like the Silk Road and its successors. The corporate world has also taken interest in the technology that enables Bitcoin, especially its decentralized financial network and the blockchain, the global ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Many banks are making big bets that real-world financial transactions will one day be run on networks similar to Bitcoin, which can operate more quickly, efficiently and securely than traditional financial networks. There are now many competitors to Bitcoin, like Ethereum, and their value has also been pushed up by growing interest in the Bitcoin technology. But Bitcoin has remained the largest so-called cryptocurrency and is generally the one that people use to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a shadowy creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who only communicated by email and social messaging. While several people have been identified as likely candidates to be Satoshi, as the creator is known in the world of Bitcoin, not one has been confirmed. So the search for Satoshi has gone on. Satoshi created the original rules of the Bitcoin network and then released the software to the world in 2009. Whether it is he, she or they, Satoshi largely disappeared from view two years later. Anyone can download and use the software, and Satoshi now has no more control over the network than anyone else using the software.",0.19776046511627907,0.07972057227871181

Old-School Sleuthing, With a Digital Twist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/world/europe/ransomware-cyberattack-wannacry-hacking.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-05-15T00:19:40+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"LONDON — Bank robbers wear masks and escape in vans with stolen license plates. Kidnappers compose ransom letters from newsprint to elude handwriting experts. Burglars target houses with the upstairs window ajar. Cybercriminals do much the same. They hide behind software that obscures their identity and leads investigators to look in countries far from their actual hide-outs. They kidnap data and hold it hostage. And they target the most vulnerable companies and people whose information is poorly protected. Cybercrimes, like the global ransomware attack that began Friday and has affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, are in a way an updated version of ancient criminal methods. And in the global search for the criminals that continued Sunday, investigators are following much the same process that detectives in the physical world have used for decades: secure the crime scene, collect forensic evidence and try to trace the clues back to the perpetrator. But for all of their similarities to traditional crimes, cyberattacks have major digital twists that can make them much harder to solve and can greatly magnify the damage done. The latest attack has claimed at least 200,000 victims worldwide, according to an estimate on Sunday by Europol, Europe’s police agency, and new variants of the malware are emerging, leading security experts to warn that the fallout could spread as people return to work on Monday. Such a large, complex and global crime outbreak means any hope of a successful investigation will require close teamwork among international law enforcement agencies — like the F.B.I., Scotland Yard and security officials in China and Russia — often wary of sharing information with one another. “With cybercrime, you can operate globally without ever having to leave your home,” said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyberoperations at Government Communications Headquarters, Britain’s equivalent of the National Security Agency. “Catching who did this is going to be very hard, and will require a level of international cooperation from law enforcement that does not come naturally.” The only institutional arrangement for international cooperation on cybercrime is the so-called Budapest Convention, whose membership is largely restricted to Western democracies, said Nigel Inkster, a former assistant chief of Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6. Authoritarian states such as Russia and China have refused to sign on to the agreement because it permits the digital equivalent of hot pursuit: A police force investigating a cybercrime can access networks in other jurisdictions without first seeking permission. “Any investigation of the recent ransomware attack will have to be done by a coalition of the willing,” Mr. Inkster said. There are signs a coalition is coming together, at least in parts of the international system. Europol said its team of cybersecurity specialists — made up of agents from countries like Germany, Britain and the United States — was investigating the attack. Europe and Asia were the regions most affected by the crime, with hospitals, car plants and even the Russian Ministry of Interior falling prey to the malware, which takes over a computer, locks down the machine and releases it only when the owner has paid a ransom. Hours after the attack was first reported in Britain, where the computer systems of the National Health Service were crippled, law enforcement agencies across Europe, Asia and the United States began looking for clues that could trace the assault to specific people or organizations. As with a physical crime scene, the first step with any cyberinvestigation is to make sure the criminal is no longer hiding out, about to pounce again. “Before we get into who did it, we try to figure out if the bad guys still have access,” said Theresa Payton, a former chief information officer of the White House and founder of Fortalice, a cybersecurity firm. “Are they still hiding? Are they going to come back tomorrow? Is the door that let them in still ajar? Can they inflict more pain?” “And if so, where are they?” she added. “How do we cordon them off to mitigate further damages?” Instead of searching the closets of a property that has been broken into, investigators will examine the affected server, online software caches and emails to identify any malware that might not have been activated yet. In the case of the ransomware that was unleashed Friday and is known as WannaCry, Wcry or Wanna Decryptor, it was quickly determined that updating Windows software with the latest security patch was enough to inoculate computers that had not been infected. Then the forensic work begins, with agents looking for digital fingerprints. Because of the highly technical nature of these investigations, private data security teams can be expected to help in the search. That includes working directly with law enforcement to uncover clues left behind by the attackers, as well as tracking the virus and its effects separately to protect their corporate clients. These firms have been instrumental in solving some cases. In the WannaCry case, the phishing emails sent by the criminals with the infected link are a key piece of evidence. Patricia Lewis, the international security research director at Chatham House in London, likened the text of the email to a physical letter and its metadata to the envelope it arrives in. “An envelope has lots of information on it: the stamp with the time and place it was sent from, the handwriting or printer type, a sender’s address, maybe a fingerprint or DNA from saliva on the seal,” Ms. Lewis said. Criminals are aware their emails contain revealing clues, and they try to cover their tracks. “People use cloakers, which hide your identity, making you look as if you are someone and somewhere else,” she said. Like tracing the license plates of a stolen car back to the wrong person, this can lead investigators astray. “But a good detective can track them,” Ms. Lewis said. “They always leave digital bread crumbs that can be followed.” Investigators will check whether the email address the malware came from is linked to social media accounts, past cybercrimes or other locations on the web. They will study the domain name it is linked to. And they will look for patterns to try to connect one crime to others. Success often depends on whether law enforcement can tie small digital details, including potential mistakes or a certain style in the programming code, back to the criminals. The location of where some of the ransom money is withdrawn can also help connect the dots. Sometimes the patterns that lead investigators to their target can be surprising. One state-sponsored hack was traced to Russia because detectives noticed those responsible were online only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moscow time, Ms. Lewis recalled. In another case, hackers were observing Chinese holidays. When Sony was hacked, officials linked the malware that was used to one that had been used before in North Korea. “That was a big clue,” Ms. Lewis said. “But of course it could have been deliberately planted.” In the recent hack of the political campaign of the new president of France, Emmanuel Macron, for instance, security experts were able to link the registration of certain website domains used in the attack to Russian hackers. Investigators in the latest attack are looking for clues in the ransom notes written in more than 20 languages. Some suggested that the assailants might have connections to China because the Mandarin version of the text was better written than its English equivalent. Once equipped with enough identifying data to start narrowing down suspects, investigators will go undercover to listen to the chatter on technology boards where cybercriminals are known to spend time. “It’s like using an undercover operative purporting to be part of a criminal gang, except it’s online,” Mr. Inkster said. “Half the dark web are cyberagents these days,” Ms. Lewis joked. “They’re tripping over each other.” One of the most challenging new developments for investigators is the use of Bitcoin, a digital currency with little oversight. In the latest attack, the criminals demanded ransoms ranging from $300 to $600, to be paid in Bitcoin. Bitcoin accounts, or wallets, are extremely difficult to trace. While law enforcement agencies have cracked cases by tracking Bitcoin transactions, the process is arduous. It could take months, if not years, for law enforcement agencies to pinpoint the identity of the attackers. Ultimately, in the world of computers, as in the physical world, investigators rely on criminals to make a mistake. As Adam Malone, a former cyberagent for the F.B.I., put it, “A lot of times we catch bad guys because they get sloppy.”",-0.10936617647058822,0.0258787568057526

A decade-old internet scourge called ransomware went mainstream on Friday when cybercriminals seized control of computers around the world, from the delivery giant FedEx in the United States to Britain’s public health system, universities in China and even Russia’s powerful Interior Ministry. On Saturday, investigators could not yet tell who was behind the attack as security experts around the world raced to contain it. Across Asia, several universities and organizations said they had been affected. Renault, the European automaker, said on Saturday that its French operations had been hit, while one of its plants in Slovakia was shut down because of the digital outbreak. Computer users in the United States so far were less affected after a 22-year-old British cybersecurity researcher inadvertently stopped the ransomware attack from spreading more widely. Ransomware is nothing new. For years, there have been stories of individuals or companies horrified that they have been locked out of their computers and that the only way back in is to pay a ransom to someone, somewhere who has managed to take control. But computer criminals are discovering that ransomware is the most effective way to make money in the shortest amount of time. The advent of new tools that wrap victims’ data with tough encryption technology, hard-to-trace digital currency like Bitcoin, and even online sites that offer to do the data ransoming in return for a piece of the action, have made this method of cybertheft much easier. “You don’t even need to have any skills to do this anymore,” said Jason Rebholz, a senior director at the Crypsis Group who has helped dozens of victims of ransomware. Ransomware has allowed people who are not computer experts to become computer thieves. It used to be that hackers had to be a little creative and skilled to get money out of people. There were fake antivirus scams that promised to clean up your computer — for a fee. Sometimes they resorted to so-called Trojan horse programs that lay in wait on e-commerce or banking sites, ready to get your credit card numbers. And there was old-fashioned hacking, grabbing all sorts of personal credentials that could be sold on the so-called dark web. Four years ago, investigators were pursuing roughly 16 variants of ransomware that were predominantly being used on victims in Eastern Europe. Now there are dozens of types of ransomware, and they are supported by an entire underground industry. And catching and convicting the people responsible is difficult. Friday’s attacks were a powerful escalation of earlier, much smaller episodes. Hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft servers that was first discovered by the National Security Agency and then leaked online by a group of unknown hackers last month. It allowed the ransomware to spread from server to server, encrypting as many files as it could, and holding more than 70,000 organizations victim in the process. As of Saturday afternoon, several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware had received the equivalent of $33,000, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. And the number could grow. The attack should not have been a shock. As data has become our lifeline, cybercriminals have elevated their game and their demands. Just five years ago, attackers in Eastern Europe were locking up victims’ computers and demanding ransoms of $100 to $400 to unlock them. Back then, the idea of paying a criminal on the internet was still foreign, and most important, technicians and security experts could find ways to unlock computers without caving on the ransom. In 2012, security experts estimated that  less than 3 percent of victims paid. These days, it’s a 50-50 split between those who pay the ransom and those who refuse, either because they have adequate backups, are philosophically opposed or simply cannot afford to pay. Ransoms now range from as little as one Bitcoin, which equates to roughly $1,700, to as many as 30 Bitcoin, nearly $51,000, with the median ransom equating to four Bitcoin, or nearly $7,000, according to researchers at the Crypsis Group. Bitcoin has given cybercriminals an easy and anonymous way to get their profits, and it is much harder to track than credit cards or wire transfers. There is even now a concept of “ransomware as a service” — a play on the Silicon Valley jargon “software as a service,” which describes the delivery of software over the internet. Now anyone can visit a web page, generate a ransomware file with the click of a mouse, encrypt someone’s systems and demand a ransom to restore access to the files. If the victim pays, the ransomware provider takes a cut of the payment. Ransomware criminals also have customer service lines that victims can call to get help paying a ransom. There are even live chat options. And while some amateur ransomware attackers may not restore victims’ data once the ransom is paid, the more professional outfits worry that if they do not decrypt a victim’s data, their reputation and “business” may suffer as a result, Mr. Rebholz said. The most notorious of these attackers, a group called SamSam after its type of ransomware, is known for demanding the highest ransoms, 25 to 30 Bitcoin. But they reliably decrypt a victim’s data after being paid. Most small- to medium-size businesses pay the ransoms because they do not have backups of their data and feel they have no other option, Mr. Rebholz said. “That data is the bloodline of their business in many cases,” he said. “They can either go out of business or pay the ransom.” Cybercriminals have also found a soft target in universities, which usually have more open systems that allow for the free flow of information. More recently, they have found a niche in health care, where ransomware attacks take on a new level of urgency as doctors and emergency rooms in Britain discovered on Friday when hackers blocked their access to patient records, and patients had to be turned away. Imperial College Healthcare in London, for example, was hit with ransomware 19 times over 12 months, according to freedom-of-information requests submitted by SentinelOne, a security firm. In the United States, the number of reported ransomware attacks rose fourfold between 2015 and 2016, as did the ransom payments to hackers, to $1 billion, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Last year hospitals in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and Texas were hit with ransomware. And in February, a Los Angeles hospital paid $17,000 to hackers to regain access to its computers. On Wednesday, Dr. Krishna Chinthapalli published an article in the British Medical Journal warning that such an attack was imminent. Dr. Chinthapalli cited a report that one out of every three British National Health Service trusts, the health care providers that serve specific geographic regions or offer specialized mental health or ambulance services, were hit by ransomware last year. “In the past three months, health care providers have been preparing themselves for these attacks, either with Bitcoin at the ready or with professional incident responders,” said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York company that tracked Friday’s attacks. Nearly half of ransomware attacks begin by persuading an employee to click on an email. Sometimes the methods used by cybercriminals are more complex. A “watering hole attack,” for example, infects a website with ransomware code. When users visit the site, that code is downloaded onto their machine. The other half, Mr. Rebholz and others said, target victims with “brute force” methods: Hackers scan an organization for software vulnerabilities, weak passwords or other unlocked digital doors. After that, ransomware attackers try to encrypt as many files as possible. The SamSam group is known to move from file to file, manually encrypting hundreds of systems, so it can demand the highest in Bitcoin ransoms, according to the Crypsis Group, Symantec and others. It seems no one is immune. In January, a hacker held hostage a small cancer charity in Indiana, wiping the organization’s main and backup servers and demanding 50 Bitcoin — more than $87,000 — in return for restoring their data. They did not pay. And ransomware attackers are not above playing martyr. In one recent attack that Mr. Rebholz tracked, the attackers tried to convince their victim that paying a “contribution” — or ransom — would benefit sick children around the world. “That’s where we are,” Mr. Rebholz said. “Threat actors are now trying to play people’s emotions, trying to put a pretty face on criminal activity by pretending to be a charity case.”",-0.09521944444444445,0.03883545274170274

Within a few minutes of S.E.C.’s announcement, the price of a single Bitcoin tumbled more than 15 percent, to around $1,060. The price soon recovered some of the lost ground, however. The decision was a significant setback for Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twin brothers who began working on a proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., four years ago. An exchange-traded fund tracks an index, or basket, of assets but trades like a stock. The commission said it was rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust because the markets where Bitcoin are currently traded are largely unregulated. The lack of such regulation, the commission said, raised “concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market.” The price of Bitcoin has climbed sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of the commission approving the Winklevoss brothers’ fund, with the price of a single Bitcoin surging to a record high above $1,300. Bitcoin aficionados had hoped that an exchange-traded fund would help bring the virtual currency into the mainstream by making it available to retail investors through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and eTrade. Several other companies have also applied to operate Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the S.E.C. could reach a different decision on those proposed funds. But the commission’s broad concern about the unregulated nature of Bitcoin markets suggests that an approval may be unlikely in the near future. “It seems as if the other E.T.F.s in the pipeline for the S.E.C. are facing the same stone wall,” Charles Hayter, founder of the virtual currency data provider CryptoCompare, said on Friday. The commission wrote in its decision that Bitcoin was “still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated Bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop.” The commission added that it could reconsider a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund if more mature markets developed. Tyler Winklevoss said that he and his brother were not giving up on the exchange-traded fund. “We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through,” he said. “We agree with the S.E.C. that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.” The twins rose to fame through their legal tussles with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. More recently, the brothers have bought significant quantities of Bitcoin and have dedicated themselves to promoting the virtual currency and bringing it into the mainstream. The twins already won regulatory approval from New York authorities for their Gemini Exchange, where virtual currencies can be bought and sold by professional traders. The proposed E.T.F. would have been tied to the price of Bitcoin on the exchange. Most Bitcoin, however, are traded outside the United States, beyond the reach of American regulators. The virtual currency emerged in 2009 and was celebrated for its ability to circumvent government authorities. Since then, Bitcoin has gained prominence partly because of its use on shadowy online black markets, where it is exchanged for drugs, and in countries like China and Venezuela, where some citizens are looking to evade government oversight. Over time, it has become clear that Bitcoin’s growth prospects are probably limited if it is not easily available through regulated institutions to ordinary investors. Jerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center, a virtual currency advocacy group, said that the S.E.C.’s decision presented a problem for the further development of the technology. “How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?” Mr. Brito said in a statement on Friday. Many large financial institutions have mostly declined to invest significant resources into Bitcoin, because of the regulatory questions that surround it. But the same institutions have been showing a great deal of interest in the technological concept introduced by Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, which presents a new way of keeping track of all types of information.",0.24046875,0.0803340604707792
57,Remember Bitcoin? Some Investors Might Want to Forget,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/technology/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-crash.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-12-27,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"PALO ALTO, Calif. — Last year around this time, a toy called a cryptokitty sold for $170,000. A real estate agent remade himself as CoinDaddy, producing cryptocurrency-themed music videos. The man behind a company called Ripple became for a moment richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Kids barely out of high school were buying Lamborghinis because of a crypto meme. Experts went on CNBC to say Bitcoin was going to reach $100,000 per coin. For a few sweet months of 2018, all of Silicon Valley was wrapped up in frenzied easy money and a fantasy of remaking the world order with cryptocurrencies and a related technology called the blockchain. A flood of joy hit the Bay Area. The New York Times ran with the trend in an article with the headline “Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You’re Not.” It was temporarily true. And just as the American public had been given every possible blockchain explainer that could be written, the whole thing collapsed. The bubble popped. Today the price of Bitcoin — $19,783 last December — is $3,810. Litecoin was $366 a coin; it’s now $30. Ethereum was $1,400 in January; today it’s $130. One recent crypto holiday party offered “broken Lambo dreams and an open bar to drown your sorrows in.” This December closes out cryptocurrency’s most exciting year, ending in a terrible, sober headache of a winter. At the meetups and the work spaces that remain, those who have stayed are calling this “the winter of crypto.” Believers say this is only “the trough of disillusionment,” pointing to a chart that posits all new technology goes through a similar trough before exploding into inevitable glory. Those still chipping away at crypto dreams insist that this is all a good thing because only the serious ones, the true crypto believers, remain. “It’s painful to lose money, but it’s a necessary step,” said Robert Neivert, an investor with the venture capital firm 500 Startups. “2018 was about moving from hype to product.” This year, the blockchain industry — a subset of the cryptocurrency industry that would very much like to live on its own — went through a Cambrian explosion. But first, an explanation of the blockchain: A blockchain is a relatively new kind of database that was initially introduced with Bitcoin. It is not the digital currency. It is the underlying technology that helps manage the currency. Most important, it is decentralized so no one person, government or business controls it. Blockchain became a solution for everything — blockchain for journalism, for pot, for dentists. At the kernel of it all was real technological progress and a growing understanding that this decentralized technology could transform financial systems. But the excitement spun out of control. Even adding the word “blockchain” made stock soar. When Long Island Iced Tea Company changed its name to Long Blockchain Company, its stock went up 500 percent in a day. Scammers flooded the space, launching dubious new investment schemes called “initial coin offerings.” The computing power needed to “mine” a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is now sometimes costing more than that coin is worth. Mines — actually, they are electricity-needy data centers — are shutting down. Images of electronics piled up on street corners are going viral. As demand for Bitcoin has dwindled, Bitcoin’s algorithm has adjusted and the coin has become easier to mine. But this is actually good, crypto experts argue. “The fact that miners are shutting down and difficulty is decreasing is a feature, not a bug, of bitcoin’s design,” the venture capitalist Arianna Simpson wrote on Twitter. Some in the cryptocurrency business would just like the world to know that there are still people working on it. Julian Spediacci, a cryptocurrency investor in San Francisco with his twin brother, James, said he would like people to know that he is still alive and identifies as a HODLer, or someone who is not selling despite market fluctuations. “A lot of people are reaching out, and they want to find out what happened to us, and if we’re still alive, so it’d be great to clarify that there are a lot of OG HODLers,” Mr. Spediacci said, using language common in the crypto industry to indicate he would remain an investor. “I think we’re nearing a bottom,” his brother said. Some of the friends they made have left town. The meetups are quieter. The most recent video from the community’s primary musical voice, CoinDaddy, né Arya Bahmanyar, is set to the tune of Beatles hit “Yesterday.” But the Spediacci brothers continue. They say they are starting a new hedge fund. And that weekend there would be a holiday party at a new blockchain incubator, Starfish, run by Alicia Ferratusco. An incubator is a space where a group of start-ups work together, in this case working on blockchain technology. “It’s called Starfish because when you cut off the leg of the starfish, it can grow back,” Julian Spediacci said. Not everyone is struggling in the downturn. For lawyers, it is a new gold rush. “Now that the market dropped, everyone is getting sued,” said Chante Eliaszadeh, a law student and the president of a blockchain law club called Blockchain at Berkeley Law. She said the legal scene is pretty exciting right now. As the Securities and Exchange Commission cracks down, some scammers are trying to escape to Bali or Malta, where regulations are more lax. At one holiday party in Palo Alto this year, the theme was “real.” Organizers had pasted the motto — “Real People, Real Money, Real Deals” — on the walls, on boards, on slide shows and handouts. Moderating a panel was Radhika Iyengar-Emens, a founding partner at a venture firm that specializes in cryptocurrency and blockchain start-ups called StarChain Ventures. “I think we’re going to see a lot of real use cases,” Ms. Iyengar-Emens said. “And these guys will be here for those very real use cases.” A use case would be a regular consumer’s being able to use a cryptocurrency to do something other than make a speculative investment. The audience sat in folding white chairs. The snacks were Ritz Bits. “What is QuarkChain?” QuarkChain’s founder and chief executive, Qi Zhou, asked the audience. “Next generation blockchain.” Kerry Washington, a member of the Litecoin Foundation, which promotes Litecoins, gave a presentation about the year, in which the coin lost more than 90 percent of its value. He talked about a big Litecoin summit this year, which on one slide he specified cost a quarter-million dollars. There, guests could buy candy with Litecoins. This showed everyone how useful Litecoin could be, he said. The trouble was always that we already have something that lets us buy candy. An ad played for something called Bitrue, a wallet. It was just a half-dozen people looking straight at the camera saying: “I trust Bitrue.” And then Curtis Wang, the chief executive of Bitrue, stood up to announce a very special offer. He could promise investors a 10 percent annual percentage yield. There was scattered applause in the crowd. Someone in the audience raised a hand and asked whether that was even legal to offer.",0.1928304347826087,0.07573025806721459
58,"Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/business/dealbook/blockchain-ibm-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-03-04T10:00:27+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Frank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from. Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart’s headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain. As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, “I became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.” The blockchain — the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date. At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that “chains” together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions. IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology. The most immediate business opportunities are in the financial world as a tool to track and trade stocks, bonds and other assets. But in the next week, Maersk, the global shipping giant, is expected to announce it is using IBM’s version of the blockchain to track the avocados, flowers and machine parts it carries on its enormous cargo ships. Last month, the government of Dubai said it was working with IBM to trace the goods flowing through its ports. Yet success is far from assured. Rival Microsoft said this past week that it was working with JPMorgan Chase and several other corporate giants on a system that competes against IBM’s, based on the virtual currency network known as Ethereum. Many banks are concerned that IBM could push them into a version of the blockchain that would lock them into IBM’s software. “We believe with 100 percent certainty that it’s going to matter,” Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft’s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. “It’s a question of where’s its going to matter and how it’s going to matter.” It was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else. Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins — without providing any identifying information — and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone. Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government. But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin’s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into “blocks,” and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction — a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact. In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM. “I was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,” said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM. But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM’s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology. They explained that this was about more than just a currency — it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it. “That was the ‘aha’ for me,” Mr. Krishna said. “This was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.” He called it “a technology that can change the world.” There are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers. But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information. A few months after Mr. Krishna’s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM’s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities — or threats — to IBM’s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, gave the green light to. She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, “You run with this,” he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months. Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM’s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software. But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers. IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, “The first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.” After getting Ms. Rometty’s push on the blockchain, the IBM team’s first move was to make its software “open source,” meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM’s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology. It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe. For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships — instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities. While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world. What’s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year. Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved — including Maersk and government authorities — could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged. The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California. The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it’s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system. “You need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,” said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. “That’s the difficult part.” IBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark. Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach. Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains — like the one being built by IBM — are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin’s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM’s. That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, “it still concentrates power in a handful of entities,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems. The companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays. IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come. IBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined. But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project. “They have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,” Mr. Behlendorf said. “We are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.” Microsoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals. But IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. “This is the most well-thought-out project in the space,” said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor. Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work. At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners — manufacturers, customs officials and farmers — that need to come together. “I really do believe in it,” he said, “but I don’t know how fast it will be able to take off.” At Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM — moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States — and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. “I think this is our one best hope for getting it right,” he said.",0.11574571428571429,0.06480131244416959
59,Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2017-02-27T21:13:34+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and other corporate giants are joining forces to create a new kind of computing system based on the virtual currency network Ethereum. Some 30 companies are set to announce on Tuesday the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will create a standard version of the Ethereum software that businesses around the world can use to track data and financial contracts. The new organization, a nonprofit, is part of a broader movement to harness the technological concept known as the blockchain, which was introduced to the world by Bitcoin. Blockchains offer a way for unrelated computers and companies to simultaneously collect and store information without relying on a central authority, similar to the way that Wikipedia is written and maintained by a group of writers and editors rather than a single author. The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority. Many big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions. IBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation. The new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology. Other companies like R3 and Chain have also been developing alternative blockchains. “We are pretty equally spending our time across the different chains,” said Alex Batlin, the global head of blockchain at Bank of New York Mellon, which is joining the Ethereum alliance. Ethereum was introduced in 2013 by a developer named Vitalik Buterin, then 19, who had previously worked on Bitcoin. Since its official release in 2015, the Ethereum network has been the target of hackers and theft. Yet it has also won a large following among programmers who view it as a new and sophisticated way for groups of people and companies to initiate and track transactions and contracts of all sorts. That has led some companies to bet that Ethereum will win the race to become the standard blockchain for future business operations. “In every industry that we come across, Ethereum is usually the first platform that people go to,” said Marley Gray, the principal blockchain architect at Microsoft. The creation of the Ethereum alliance shows a continuing commitment among big companies to making the technology work, in large part because it promises to create much more streamlined databases that require less back-office maintenance. Accenture released a report last month arguing that blockchain technology could save the 10 largest banks $8 billion to $12 billion a year in infrastructure costs — or 30 percent of their total costs in that area. Accenture is one of 11 companies on the governing board of the Ethereum alliance. The current Ethereum network has an internal virtual currency known as Ether, the value of which has risen and fallen over the last two years. On Monday, a single Ether was worth around $15, and all the outstanding Ether were worth around $1.3 billion. Ethereum, however, is much more than just a system for tracking currency. It also allows people to write what are known as smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. Two companies could, for instance, create a contract that would automatically send money to one of them if a particular news authority reported that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series or that “La La Land” won the Oscar for best picture. (As the latter example shows, what would happen if the authority was wrong is a more difficult question.) Because of its capacity for smart contracts — and other complicated computing capacities — Ethereum is viewed as more agile and adaptable than Bitcoin. As with Bitcoin, however, anyone can join the Ethereum network and see all the activity on the Ethereum blockchain. The companies working on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance want to create a private version of Ethereum that can be rolled out for specific purposes and be open only to certified participants. Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes. The purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case. The private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose. Many companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance. Some of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world. “Even if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,” Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said. The work on Ethereum has continued despite an attack on an Ethereum project last year in which a hacker gained control of more than $50 million worth of Ether. Mr. Batlin and others involved in the Ethereum Alliance said the way the Ethereum developers had handled that attack convinced them of the maturity of the technology. Today, Ethereum has a larger community of volunteer developers, and more computers on its network than Bitcoin. And the members of the new alliance — which include Banco Santander, BBVA, Credit Suisse, ING, Intel, Thomson Reuters and UBS — say the real-world testing of Ethereum makes it stronger than the alternatives. “Ethereum has this massive advantage of having the public network that has been tested for two years,” Mr. Gray, of Microsoft, said.",0.28176666666666667,0.10754376245447676

The electronic key system at the picturesque Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt had been infiltrated, and the hotel was locked out of its own computer system, leaving guests stranded in the lobby, causing confusion and panic. “Good morning?” the email began, according to the hotel’s managing director, Christoph Brandstaetter. It went on to demand a ransom of two Bitcoins, or about $1,800, and warned that the cost would double if the hotel did not comply with the demand by the end of the day, Jan. 22. Mr. Brandstaetter said the email included details of a “Bitcoin wallet” — the account in which to deposit the money — and ended with the words, “Have a nice day!” With the 111-year-old hotel brimming with eager skiers, hikers and vacationers, some having paid about $530 for a suite with a panoramic view and sauna, Mr. Brandstaetter said he decided to cave in. Guests had already complained that their electronic room keys were not working, and receptionists’ efforts to create new ones had proved futile. Bashing down the doors was not an option. The reservation system for the hotel in the village of Turracherhöhe, about 90 minutes by car from Salzburg, was paralyzed. “We were at maximum capacity with 180 guests and decided that it was better to give in,” he said. “The hackers were very pushy.” Security experts said the attack on the hotel appeared to be a novel example of an increasingly malicious and prevalent type of modern-day piracy. The weapon? A type of software known as ransomware. The crime is as simple as it is mendacious. Victims typically receive an email with a link or attachment that contains software that encrypts files on their computer and holds them hostage until they pay a ransom. Many of the hackers who carry out such attacks operate in Russia and Eastern Europe, according to the police, and often demand a ransom in Bitcoin, a digital currency that is hard to trace. “Ransomware is becoming a pandemic,” said Tony Neate, a former British police officer who investigated cybercrime for 15 years. “With the internet, anything can be switched on and off, from computers to cameras to baby monitors.” Still, he added, “hacking a hotel and locking people out of their rooms is a new line of attack.” Mr. Neate, now chief executive of Get Safe Online, a government-backed security charity in Britain, said that demands in ransomware schemes were usually low enough that victims would acquiesce. As a result, however, hackers waged dozens of attacks a day to make them financially viable. He nevertheless counseled victims not to pay, arguing that that would only further encourage more attacks and that the funds used to pay the ransom would bankroll nefarious activity, including possibly terrorism. Hotels, he warned, should also guard against copycat crimes by reinforcing their digital security. According to the United States Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 a day. The F.B.I. said the costs to victims of such attacks rose to $209 million in the first three months of 2016, compared with $24 million throughout 2015. It is a sign of the crime’s sinister proliferation that it has also entered popular culture. In an episode of the legal drama “The Good Wife,” a Russian hacker attacked a law firm in the middle of a prominent case, encrypting its files and demanding a $50,000 ransom. The hacker eventually relented after the firm turned the tables by infecting the extortionist’s computer with propaganda criticizing Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. In the real world, however, many have been forced to pay up. Last year, hospitals in California and Kentucky were targeted in ransomware attacks. In one case, a Los Angeles hospital paid more than $17,000 to hackers to restore its computer network, and all of its digital medical files. Other victims in Europe and the United States have included a  municipal utility, companies, schools, law firms and police departments. A recent study by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a Washington-based organization focusing on cybersecurity, noted that ransomware threatened to “wreak havoc on America’s critical infrastructure community” and called it the digital equivalent of a “centuries old criminal tactic.” Mr. Brandstaetter said he had decided to go public with the attack at his hotel so that others would be more vigilant.

The company that serves as the back end for much Wall Street trading — the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, or D.T.C.C. — said on Monday that it would replace one of its central databases, used by the largest banks in the world, with new software inspired by Bitcoin. The organization, based in New York, plays a role in recording and reporting nearly every stock and bond trade in the United States, as well as most valuable derivatives trades. IBM, which has been making a big push into blockchain technology, will be leading the project for the D.T.C.C. and aims to have it fully functioning by early next year. “This is a real tangible step into what could be a very different future for Wall Street,” Michael C. Bodson, the chief executive of the D.T.C.C., said in an interview. The announcement is one of the most advanced steps yet in Wall Street’s continuing effort to harness the technological concepts underlying Bitcoin. Financial institutions around the world have been fascinated by Bitcoin not because of the volatile virtual currency itself, but because it introduced a new way of executing and recording financial transactions without a central authority. All Bitcoin transactions take place on a global financial ledger known as a blockchain, which is maintained and updated by a network of thousands of computers around the world, similar to the way that Wikipedia is kept up by diffuse volunteers rather than by a single company. Wall Street has been drawn to the blockchain concept because it allows information to be recorded in real time without the bottleneck that central authorities generally introduce. The decentralized nature of the technology also makes it harder for attackers, or hackers, to take control of the network. The D.T.C.C. project will not use Bitcoin’s blockchain. Instead it is building something similar to a blockchain, known as a distributed ledger, which multiple financial institutions can update and view at the same time. Unlike Bitcoin’s blockchain, the D.T.C.C. ledger will be open only to invited participants. Mr. Bodson said the basic promise of a distributed ledger is that it provides “one version of the truth that everyone shares and everyone utilizes.” The new ledger will replace an existing database, known as the Trade Information Warehouse, that records information about every credit default swap trade that comes through the D.T.C.C. Credit default swaps, which played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, are essentially bets on the success of bonds. The D.T.C.C. oversaw about $11 trillion in credit default swaps trading last year, or 80 percent of all trades in the global market. Banks rely on the Trade Information Warehouse to determine when payments are due and what size they will be. Because the database will be edited in group fashion, the hope is that it will provide a more streamlined and reliable source of information. Mr. Bodson said that if the database was successful, the D.T.C.C. could use the technology to move money rather than just record information. Over the last few years, most banks have announced efforts to explore the potential utility of blockchain technology. This has gone to the highest levels, with some central banks talking about moving their own national currencies onto some sort of blockchain. But while there have been endless announcements about tests and proofs of concept, almost no one has disclosed plans to actually use a blockchain or distributed ledger in the real world. Until now, the most discussed announcement came from the Australian stock exchange, which said in early 2016 that it had hired an American software company, Digital Asset Holdings, to build a distributed ledger for its back-end systems. The Australian exchange, though, has said it has not made a final decision on whether it will move to the new technology. The D.T.C.C. has been talking publicly about its interest in the blockchain for a while, and last year it announced that it had successfully completed a test of a distributed ledger database in its credit default swaps trading business. Mr. Bodson said that since then the D.T.C.C. had determined that a distributed ledger would be cheaper to run than its existing system. The D.T.C.C. tests were done using a distributed ledger technology created by a start-up, Axoni, that will also be involved in the project, along with R3, a consulting firm working with dozens of banks on blockchain projects, and IBM. “The fact that they are taking this as seriously as they are is indicative of the broad-felt sense in the financial community that this technology is here to stay,” Charley Cooper, a managing director of R3, said of the D.T.C.C.",0.14976097560975613,0.07123897951641854

The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics — highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory — has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1,025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1,150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1,000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low — under $200 — in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a medium-size American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. “I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.",0.21599500000000002,0.08987596951659452

The government wants to know about the identities of those who may be trying to hide income. As the world of financial technology has gone from a geeky backwater to the forefront of innovation, regulators are following along by seeking a role in overseeing how the firms operate and determining who may be abusing their services. You know that fintech has come of age when the government comes knocking at the door just like it does with any other bank or broker. Transactions in virtual currencies like Bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger, but the identity of those actually buying or selling is not available. Coinbase wallets give users a measure of anonymity that they would not have if dealing with large amounts of cash at a bank, something that has garnered the attention of the I.R.S. The inspector general for tax administration in the Treasury Department issued a report in September criticizing the agency for not developing a program to ensure that Bitcoin users were complying with the tax laws. On Nov. 30, a federal magistrate judge in San Francisco approved a “John Doe summons” to Coinbase that requires it to identify Americans who maintained wallets transacting in virtual currencies at any time from 2013 through 2015. The company’s website says it has 4.9 million customers, so the government will be able to obtain information about a substantial number of people who have traded Bitcoin over the three years identified. The I.R.S. uses this type of summons when it does not know the identity of the taxpayers who may have violated the law. This method means it is a civil investigation at this point, but if there are indications of large-scale tax evasion, the Justice Department could start a criminal inquiry into Bitcoin traders. Because this type of financial information is so personal, federal law requires the I.R.S. to show a reasonable basis that an “ascertainable group” may have failed to comply with the tax laws and that the information is not readily available from other sources. Unlike an investigation of a particular individual who can challenge a summons, the I.R.S. goes into court unopposed and the judge considers only the application and any information provided to support the request, known as an ex parte proceeding. In 2014, the I.R.S. issued a notice that virtual currencies were property, which means that every transaction may result in a capital gain or loss, depending on the value at the time of each trade. That would be like having to figure out how much a dollar was really worth on the currency market when it went into your pocket and then was used — a reporting nightmare for those who engage in a number of transactions. It is understandable that Bitcoin users would simply ignore the need to report gains and losses. The summons to Coinbase looks to be an effort to respond to the lack of action on the virtual currency front by focusing on more nefarious uses of virtual currencies. The government submitted an affidavit from an I.R.S. agent describing information received in its investigation that indicated Bitcoin users have not properly reported transactions. The government identified three instances of possible tax evasion to justify the broad demand for information from Coinbase, essentially pointing to these cases as the tip of an iceberg of violations. One individual started using virtual currencies after offshore banks became too cumbersome to hide assets, the government said. Two companies tried to evade paying taxes by designating transactions in Bitcoin as “technology expenses” to make them appear to be just ordinary costs of doing business. Needless to say, Coinbase is unhappy about having to turn over information about its customers. A statement issued in response to the filing for the John Doe summons says “we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government’s request. Our customers’ privacy rights are important to us,” vowing to “oppose the government’s petition in court.” The information sought is not outside the norm for this type of sweeping investigation. In 2014, a federal district judge in Manhattan issued a summons for records from FedEx, DHL and United Parcel Service for information about deliveries from 2005 to 2013 from an offshore firm that helped Americans avoid paying taxes. In 2015, a Miami federal district judge issued a summons to Bank of America and Citibank for almost nine years of records from correspondent accounts they maintained on behalf of a bank in Belize that was used to shield assets. Unfortunately, there is little Coinbase can do to resist this type of demand for information once it is approved by the court. It could refuse to provide the information and then appeal an order requiring it to comply with the summons, but the anonymity cherished by many Bitcoin users is unlikely to get much traction when there is evidence of potential tax evasion. Failing to provide the information could also result in Coinbase being found in contempt of court, which can result in substantial fines until it chooses to comply. The I.R.S. inquiry shows how Coinbase is now important enough to draw the same kind of scrutiny as more established banks. That shift also is apparent in a new initiative by the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the federal banking regulators, that would allow fintech companies to apply for a new charter to become a “special purpose national bank.” As The New York Times reported, the idea is to extend oversight to companies moving into services provided by traditional banks that have largely avoided direct regulation. The new type of charter could help fintech firms avoid dealing with a patchwork of laws that make expanding their businesses more difficult while extending federal regulatory oversight. One of the crucial requirements for any bank or broker is compliance with the strict rules against money laundering, especially the “know your customer” requirement that largely prevents secret accounts and untraceable transactions. An interesting question is whether companies like Coinbase that provide a repository for virtual currencies will migrate toward becoming more like banks or stock brokerages that would remove the anonymity they now provide to users of their services. The key to the tax system is identifying taxpayers who may be trying to skirt reporting requirements. Virtual currency and the fintech industry as a whole have grown outside the traditional regulatory system, but their size and emerging importance mean that more oversight is on the doorstep. When your client base is large enough for the taxman to go on a fishing expedition to see who is using your services, you have truly come of age. Whether that attention is welcome is another issue.",0.06497777777777777,0.026822390572390574
64,Bitcoin Users Who Evade Taxes Are Sought by the I.R.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/business/dealbook/irs-is-seeking-tax-evaders-who-use-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-11-18T21:24:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The Internal Revenue Service is on the hunt for people who used Bitcoin to evade taxes. The tax agency sent a broad request on Thursday to Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, asking for the records of all customers who bought virtual currency from the company from 2013 to 2015. The document, a so-called John Doe summons, said that an I.R.S. agent recently found three cases in which people were using Bitcoin to evade taxes — two of which involved Coinbase customers. The I.R.S. said that those findings — and Bitcoin’s relatively high level of anonymity — have led the agency to think that many more people are using the virtual currency for similar purposes. “The I.R.S. not only has suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law — it knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others,” the document says. The summons comes shortly after the Treasury Department’s inspector general issued a report chastising the tax agency for not taking more aggressive action to curb “unlawful activities by those who use virtual currencies.” “None of the I.R.S. operating divisions have developed any type of compliance initiatives or guidelines for conducting examinations or investigations specific to tax noncompliance related to virtual currencies,” the report, delivered in September, said. The request this week would require Coinbase, a start-up based in San Francisco with funding from several leading venture capital firms, to turn over the identity and full transaction history of millions of customers — it had about three million customers at the end of 2015. But the company is already gearing up to fight the request. “We want to work with law enforcement — that’s generally our policy,” the company’s head legal counsel, Juan Suarez, said Friday. “But we can’t tolerate sweeping fishing expeditions. We are very concerned about the financial privacy rights of our customers.” The existence of the summons was reported earlier on Twitter by the financial blog Zero Hedge. The request from the I.R.S. appears to be the most sweeping single effort to track down people using virtual currency to break the law. In the past, Coinbase has received narrowly tailored requests for information about customers, and generally complied, Mr. Suarez said, but never something as broad as the latest summons. Coinbase and other companies that buy and sell Bitcoins are required by regulators to record the identities of people who buy and sell virtual currency on their platforms. The underlying Bitcoin wallets, however, are tracked by a decentralized network of computers that generally do not record the identities of the people involved in transactions. A Bitcoin wallet looks like a series of random letters and numbers, and anyone can open one without providing their identity. The most famous early use of Bitcoin came on the Silk Road, an online site where users could pay for drugs with Bitcoin, with the understanding that their identity would never be recorded. The documents filed this week indicated that the tax agency was interested in going after both large tax evaders as well as small-time Bitcoin users who might not be recording their virtual currency transactions properly for tax purposes. The basic tax rules for Bitcoin users were set down by the I.R.S. in 2014. The agency’s guidance said that people should treat their virtual currency as property, rather than currency, for tax purposes. If a person buys a Bitcoin for $200, for example, then sells it later when its value has risen to $400, the $200 in gains are supposed to be recorded to the tax authorities. Omri Marian, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Irvine, said that most Bitcoin users were probably not aware that they were supposed to record their losses and gains as taxable events every time they bought anything with their Bitcoins. “It may be the case that many people were not aware that what they were doing is taxable,” Mr. Marian said on Friday. “Are those the people the I.R.S. is looking for?” An I.R.S. agent, David Utzke, said in a document filed on Thursday, along with the summons, that he was already pursuing larger offenders. Mr. Utzke said he identified two companies that were buying Bitcoin and misreporting them with the I.R.S. as technology expenses. Mr. Utzke said both of the companies were customers of Coinbase. The companies themselves were not named in the document. Coinbase provides its customers with information about the gains or losses they make on every virtual currency transaction. The tax agency, however, said it was not getting the information it needed to determine whether Coinbase users were making the proper tax payments. “The risk/reward ratio for a taxpayer in the virtual currency environment is extremely low, and the likelihood of underreporting is significant,” Mr. Utzke wrote. “The characteristics of virtual currencies could enable them to replace traditional abusive tax arrangements as the preferred method for tax evaders.”",0.00027173913043478164,0.03608853807223372

Investors were paying over $1,000 for a single unit of Zcash on Monday, a few days after the currency was first brought online. The company behind Zcash, led by a developer named Zooko Wilcox, has the support of privacy activists and computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has already secured $3 million in backing from a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists who are involved in the virtual currency industry. Zcash’s developers say they have used advanced cryptography to create a virtual currency that can be sent around the world essentially without a trace, unlike Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was initially described as an anonymous currency, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be tracked and traced by law enforcement. Each Bitcoin user has an address, made up of letters and numbers, and the authorities are often able to link an address to a real person using sophisticated data analysis. In contrast, Zcash uses a method developed by a team of cryptographers working at M.I.T. and in Israel — known as zk-Snark — that allows transactions to be confirmed by the network without anyone recording the Zcash addresses involved in the transactions. Users can opt out of this privacy function. The privacy features of Zcash could make it harder for the currency to win support from regulators and bankers. Investigators have used Bitcoin’s ledger, known as the blockchain, to track down some people selling drugs for Bitcoins on black market websites. Such websites have proliferated since the first popular black market site, the Silk Road, was taken down in late 2013. Since the demise of the Silk Road, mainstream financial institutions have shown significant interest in virtual currencies and particularly in the blockchain technology, which provides a new decentralized way to keep financial records and to power transactions of all sorts. Major central banks have recently been talking about using the technology for their own currencies. Most projects in the virtual currency area, though, have been pushing in directions that would make it easier to integrate with the existing financial system. Jonathan Levin, a founder of Chainalysis, a start-up that helps banks and regulators track activity on blockchains, said that the authorities had become comfortable with virtual currencies because they had been able to trace transactions in cases of criminal activity. “It’s going to be quite difficult for Zcash in its opaqueness to show that, no, it is not all bad stuff going on,” he said. But Mr. Wilcox has the help of a former top New York state financial regulator and a former federal prosecutor to help ease the concerns of government officials. Mr. Wilcox is hosting an open virtual meeting later this month with law enforcement officials from across the country to explain the project. Mr. Wilcox and the programmers who created Zcash say that they developed the currency not to facilitate illegal activity but to provide a degree of privacy for people who do not want their financial transactions visible to the world. “The basic story is that we have been gradually losing our privacy in a whole bunch of ways that people don’t appreciate,” said Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who began developing Zcash with some of his graduate students in 2013. “This brings back a little bit of that privacy that computers have taken away from us. This technology gives us a defense against something that until now we have been defenseless against.” Mr. Wilcox said that existing virtual currencies have been unattractive to businesses because their transaction details are exposed to competitors, creating a business need for a more private virtual currency. “All of the conversations I’ve had with businesses, banks, regulators and law enforcement have been about the need for data security for commercial applications,” he said. Zcash is modeled closely on Bitcoin. The currency will be released slowly to computers that help support the network underlying the currency. New Zcash units will be distributed to users until there are 21 million of them in the world. Initially Zcash units are being released slowly — as of Monday, only about 1,500 were out in the world, helping to feed the speculative frenzy around the currency. The concepts behind Zcash were developed by Mr. Green and other academics, but the project is being run by a for-profit Delaware corporation, Zcash Electric Coin Company, which is led by Mr. Wilcox. The corporation, developers and early investors will be compensated by what amounts to a 10 percent charge on all the new Zcash generated by users during the first four years of operation. Some of these coins will also be directed to a nonprofit Zcash foundation. There have already been several efforts beyond Zcash to correct for the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin users run their coins through so-called tumblers that can obscure the origin of transactions. Another relatively new virtual currency, Monero, came with anonymity built into the system. Earlier this year it was seized upon by speculators who pushed up the value of Monero significantly before the price fell back down. Unlike Zcash, Monero can already be used for purchases on black market websites. Mr. Green, the Zcash developer, said that some people may look to the currency for illegal purposes. But he believes that ultimately the privacy it provides will secure its importance to the mainstream economy. “You are going around on the Bitcoin blockchain leaving a trail of everything you do, which will last forever,” he said. “The idea of Zcash is you don’t have to go to special lengths to achieve privacy — privacy is baked into the system.”",0.13098541666666666,0.021326327511223347

Tell us what you think and what you’d like to see, at CanadaToday@nytimes.com. And, using the link below, please subscribe to the email newsletter version. For some time now, writing about Canada’s economy has been less than uplifting. The collapse of energy prices continues to weigh not only on the western part of the country but also other regions, like Atlantic Canada, which supplied much of the oil-sands labor force during the good times. BlackBerry, once the symbol of Canadian technology prowess, continues to shrivel and is quitting the business of designing and making smartphones. And the Canadian dollar has slumped, a direct result of the oil industry’s woes. The weaker currency was at least supposed to give a boost to Canadian factories by effectively making their products less expensive for buyers in the United States and elsewhere. So far, though, the results there have been mixed. But the past week did bring two pieces of good economic news. Thomson Reuters, the global digital information company controlled by Canada’s Thomson family, said that its most senior executives — the men with “chief” in their job titles — would move to Toronto from the United States. Perhaps more important, the company will make Toronto a technology hub. The decision could create up to 1,500 jobs. The announcement was indirectly linked to BlackBerry. The skills of graduates from the University of Waterloo helped draw Thomson Reuters to Canada; Mike Lazaridis, a co-founder of BlackBerry, studied at Waterloo. The other bright spot came from old-fashioned manufacturing. In its current contract negotiations with Detroit-based automakers, the big trade union Unifor has set preserving jobs in Canadian factories as its central objective, and is showing some results. After persuading General Motors to commit to two of its Canadian plants last month, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles agreed this week to refurbish the paint operations at an aging factory in suburban Toronto. The two automakers, unlike Thomson Reuters, will be looking to various levels of government to provide some of the money to be invested in the plants. If the federal government signs on, the decision may be criticized in hard-hit western provinces, particularly Alberta, if no corresponding aid is offered to the energy industry. The death of Jim Prentice, the former premier of Alberta, in the crash of a business jet in British Columbia was felt across Canada on Friday. Mr. Prentice held a variety of cabinet posts in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2010. He stood out in what was an otherwise highly partisan government by acknowledging the concerns of people and groups who were opposed to its positions. Coinage. Central banks are not about to abandon their currencies and turn everything over to Bitcoin. But they are exploring the technology that underlies the digital currency. Nathaniel Popper, a colleague of mine who literally wrote the book on Bitcoin, reported that the Bank of Canada teamed up with Canada’s five largest banks and a consulting firm to run a major digital currency simulation over the summer. Return to sender. Disputes in the world of philosophy, it seems, can get down and quite dirty. Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins of the University of British Columbia, whose studies have ranged from the knowledge of arithmetic to the nature of romantic love, is one of four philosophers who recently received feces in the mail. The identity of the sender is still unknown. But all four recipients, Jennifer Schuessler found, have been “loosely connected through a long-running, multisided argument with one of the field’s most vocal figures.” Portrait. The current exhibition of German and Austrian art at the Neue Gallery in New York focuses on women in the work of Gustav Klimt. In his review for The New York Times, Ken Johnson mentioned an interesting Canadian connection to the artist. Mäda Primavesi was just 9 years old when she posed for one of Klimt’s most famous paintings. After World War II, she moved to Canada, where she founded and ran a convalescent home for children in Montreal. Well before her death in 2000, Ms. Primavesi made news by selling a portrait painted by Klimt of her mother, which had widely been thought lost. Succession. This week, one contender for the leadership of the Conservative Party, Tony Clement, quit the race; another, Erin O’Toole, officially joined it, and a third, Lisa Raitt, edged toward candidacy. Writing on iPolitics.ca, the conservative political commentator Tasha Kheiriddin suggested that immigration and identity politics could emerge as the major themes of the still-nascent campaign.

67,"Central Banks Consider Bitcoin’s Technology, if Not Bitcoin",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/dealbook/central-banks-consider-bitcoins-technology-if-not-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-10-11T20:23:26+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Bitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue. Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin. The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin — known as the blockchain or distributed ledger — to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently. The most enthusiastic central banks — including the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China — have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously. Blockchains allow several players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time. For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time — something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure. If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable. The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country’s economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer. A deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that “the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.” And in a speech on Friday, the Fed governor overseeing new technology, Lael Brainard, said the technology had the potential to transform multiple aspects of the financial system. “We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,” Ms. Brainard said. Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger. Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance — an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant. David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system. “If you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,” Mr. Andolfatto said. “There’s nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.” Even within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology. A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that “innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.” The Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its “enterprise grade” blockchain. Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions. In the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank’s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors. Eric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about. Now, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures. At the headquarters of the Netherlands’ central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire. Mr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers. “There are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,” said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. “I hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.” The experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system. The Russian national bank said last week that it had worked with a consortium of Russia’s biggest banks to develop its own distributed ledger, which it called Masterchain. The Russian institutions have been sending messages on the system but are also looking at it as a potential “component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.” The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation’s five largest banks — and the blockchain consulting firm R3 — for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum. The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money — in this case fictional money — the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts. Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world. Critics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks’ looking to distributed ledgers. The blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally? The distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network. With Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network. Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, and perhaps the most prominent champion of distributed ledgers, has said that the technology could be worth using for central banks because it would make for a financial system that does not go down even if the central bank’s computer systems are temporarily taken offline. The Bank of England said last month that it wanted the next version of the bank’s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers. Ms. Wilkins said the Bank of Canada was interested in the technology as a way to build a single, shared record of all the transactions among several institutions. That could leave much less money sitting idle while banks reconcile their different ledgers, as now happens. It would also create a standardized way of recording transactions that would allow all the players in the system to communicate more seamlessly.  “There is currently a whole industry set up to reconcile and audit all these separate ledgers, and you can’t easily connect them,” she said. “This comprehensive shared data source could be a real benefit.”",0.2636913793103448,0.0962819492129837
68,Can Cryptocurrencies Survive the Start of Government Regulation?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/business/dealbook/sec-ico-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-12-13,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ The government has finally begun a crackdown on the market for cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Does this spell the demise of digital currencies and the end of initial coin offerings? In recent weeks, the Justice Department joined a Commodity Futures Trading Commission probe into manipulation of the Bitcoin market. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement on Nov. 16 to explain that its enforcement efforts were focused on initial coin offerings, which it considers to be securities that require registration and compliance with a host of disclosure rules. The Justice Department and the C.F.T.C’s investigation is focused on whether Tether, a cryptocurrency issued by a Hong Kong-based company, may have been used to drive up Bitcoin’s value through well-timed trades. Bitcoin surged 2,000 percent in 2017 to a peak of nearly $20,000, only to tumble more than 80 percent this year. Federal prosecutors have one advantage in the investigation of Bitcoin manipulation: They can use the wire fraud statute to prosecute any scheme involving property, including intangible property like a cryptocurrency. The connection between Tether and Bitcoin was first noted in a study by two finance professors at the University of Texas. They pointed out that “trading on unregulated exchanges, and specifically on cross-digital-currency exchanges, could leave cryptocurrencies vulnerable to gaming and manipulation.” But any nascent market, like that for Bitcoin, has significant growing pains. The question is whether cryptocurrencies are really just a new form of penny stocks, albeit with a much higher valuation. Penny stocks are cheap, thinly traded and not closely followed by analysts. And as anyone who has seen “The Wolf of Wall Wall Street” knows, they are subject to wild swings and market manipulation by their controlling shareholders. A little bit of good news — whether true or not — can double or triple the stock’s price overnight. That is when those in control of the stock can dump their shares and leave those gullible enough to invest in the hope of getting in on the ground floor of the next big thing with losses. Cryptocurrencies are subject to many of the same issues as penny stocks. Most of the trading takes place on unregulated platforms overseas. While many call themselves “exchanges,” they provide virtually none of the protections afforded to investors in stocks and bonds. With no clear records of who is trading, manipulating the price may not be very difficult for sophisticated participants looking to pump up the price. On the same day the S.E.C. issued its statement last month, it also settled two cases with issuers of digital tokens for violating the securities laws, requiring them to pay penalties of $250,000 each and work to refund money to investors in their illegal offerings. In another case, Maksim Zaslavskiy, who was charged with criminal securities fraud involving an I.C.O., pleaded guilty in a Federal District Court in Brooklyn. This was the first case in which a judge found that the digital coins were a type of security, and therefore subject to the associated antifraud rules. The S.E.C. settled a case against Zachary Coburn, the founder of a company called EtherDelta that facilitated trading in digital coins, because it operated as an unregistered national securities exchange. For those looking to offer a trading platform in the United States, registering with the S.E.C. as an exchange is also an expensive and time-consuming process. By the end of the month, the S.E.C. had also settled charges with the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the music producer Khaled Khaled, known as DJ Khaled, for their promotion of digital tokens issued by a start-up called Centra Tech. The men did not disclose that they received payments for making online postings that hyped the digital coin, the regulators said. Mr. Mayweather agreed to give back the $300,000 he received, pay an additional $300,000 penalty and adhere to a three-year ban on promoting other investments. Mr. Khaled will pay back the $50,000 he got, as well as a $100,000 penalty. But even before the government began its crackdown, there was a big sign that euphoria was evaporating from the market: the decline in cryptocurrency “mining” that generates additional digital tokens. Giga Watt, a digital currency mining operation in Washington state, filed for bankruptcy recently due in large part to the collapse in Bitcoin’s price. Nvidia, which makes graphics chips that are important for mining cryptocurrencies, forecast a 20 percent drop in revenue in its next quarter because of “the sharp falloff in cryptocurrency mining demand.” For the naysayers of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, this is the anticipated end of a speculative bubble, much like the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland or the dot.com implosion. That does not necessarily mean that this type of investment will disappear, but greater government scrutiny will raise the costs for trading platforms and could effectively eliminate initial coin offerings if they must be registered with the S.E.C. Blockchain, the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, is useful, and unlikely to disappear. But whether cryptocurrencies survive as a viable means of conducting business is a different question. Nathaniel Popper pointed out recently in The New York Times that Bitcoin and its brethren were designed to make payments easier but have been “hobbled by technical problems that make their tokens hard to use in real-world transactions. Those working on the cryptocurrencies have promised solutions, but they have been slow to produce them.” Just like penny stocks, digital tokens have seen their fair share of scam artists and questionable uses. As the government puts more resources into policing the trading of digital assets, the decline in cryptocurrency prices may well accelerate as those who fear being a target of fraudulent conduct wait for a time when there are greater protections for investors. The question is: Will cryptocurriences survive for long enough for us to ever see that day?",0.03069999999999999,0.028692433671126852
69,Downside of Bitcoin: A Ledger That Can’t Be Corrected,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/business/dealbook/downside-of-virtual-currencies-a-ledger-that-cant-be-corrected.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-09-09T18:36:55+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"There has been much discussion about the potential of blockchain, the technology underlying virtual currencies like Bitcoin, to change the world. We have heard waves of inspired commentary on how the technology, with its ability to share information and record transactions, will be as revolutionary as the internet itself. At Accenture, we agree about these huge possibilities, but there is an elephant in the room that will need to be confronted. One of the accepted virtues of blockchain is that it creates a permanent, immutable ledger of transactions. For example, each of the roughly 160 million Bitcoin transactions that have occurred since the cryptocurrency began in 2009 will stay on that ledger as long as Bitcoin exists. That permanence has been vital in building trust in the decentralized currencies, which are used by millions of people. But it could severely limit blockchain’s usefulness in other areas of financial services relied on by billions of people. By clashing with new privacy laws like the “right to be forgotten” and by making it nearly impossible to resolve human error and mischief efficiently, the blockchain’s immutability could end up being its own worst enemy. The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records. This challenge is coming to light with new data privacy rules like the European Union’s general data protection regulation, which will add new consumer data privacy and ownership rights over the next two years. These rules will not just affect Europe; they will have a far-reaching impact on global companies, and not least on the back offices of major financial institutions. Entities anywhere in the world that handle personal data belonging to Europeans will be affected by such laws, and infractions could lead to fines of 4 percent of revenue. Little wonder that Accenture clients are asking how they will defend the “right to be forgotten” rules using blockchain technology that always remembers. Blockchain’s immutability could eventually run at odds with existing regulations, too. For example, the United States Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-P all require personal financial data to be easily redacted. For blockchain purists, simply questioning the immutable nature of the technology is a heresy to be resisted. Like the early internet pioneers who saw e-commerce as a crass concept that would spell the end of the web as a place for “cooperation and helpfulness,” many of today’s strongest blockchain advocates, though often highly inventive and visionary, tend to be more idealistic than pragmatic about blockchain’s evolution. (It’s worth noting that the internet, arguably the world’s primary social fabric, now also supports commerce between two billion people every day.) For example, a hacker exploited a programming error this spring in a self-executing blockchain “smart contract,” stealing more than $60 million of “ether” (another digital currency) from a start-up fund called the  Decentralized Autonomous Organization. When lawyers argued that the hacker was entitled to the assets under the erroneous code, a surprising number of blockchain purists agreed. Even after the project’s leaders succeeded in winning a consensus of participants to bifurcate the code at a point before the transaction occurred, a large number of participants continue to use the version of the chain where the theft occurred. One thing is clear: If the financial services industry is to embrace a new technology, it cannot be one in which mischief and mistakes are immutable and fraudsters can defend their actions on spurious ideological grounds. Even the smartest contracts can be susceptible to human error, and even the cleverest I.T. architectures will be hit by events that need to be undone. We need the means to solve this challenge, while maintaining blockchain’s vast strengths. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a prototype that would enable blockchains to be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators. The venture capital community has invested more than $1.4 billion in blockchain applications over the last three years, according to the World Economic Forum. This year alone, banks and technology companies are expected to spend more than $1 billion out of their own pockets to develop the technology. But if blockchain is to move beyond cryptocurrency and lab experiments to real and profitable deployments, we need to challenge conventional orthodoxy and rethink the role of absolute immutability. Perhaps we will then soon be able to read more about blockchain’s achievements rather than its potential.",0.16793793103448273,0.1104386493364326

A report released Friday morning by the forum, a convening organization for the global elite, is one of the strongest endorsements yet for a new technology — the blockchain — that has become the talk of the financial industry, despite the shadowy origins of Bitcoin. “Rather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry blockchain will become the beating heart of it,” the head of financial services industries at the World Economic Forum, Giancarlo Bruno, said in a statement released with the report. The blockchain originally referred to the database where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded and stored. Unlike existing financial ledgers or databases used by banks and other institutions, the blockchain is updated and maintained not by a single company or government. Instead it is run by a network of users. It’s akin to the way Wikipedia is maintained by users around the globe. Initially, bank executives shied away from endorsing Bitcoin because it had been used for drugs and crime. Now, however, many have focused on ways to create blockchains without using Bitcoins for transactions in any way. This is attractive because blockchains — or “distributed ledgers,” as they are often described — could offer a new way to move money and track transactions across borders and other networks in a more secure, transparent and effective way than the current system. Distributed ledgers are often viewed as most attractive to industries with businesses that lack a central institution they can trust to keep their records. The World Economic Forum report notes that most developments are likely to happen behind the scenes. So consumers won’t see the changes to infrastructure, but the changes could lead to cheaper and faster financial services. The report says the technology could help improve both mainstream transactions, like global payments and stock trading, and lesser-known areas like trade finance and contingent convertible bonds. The 130-page report from the forum is the product of a year of research and five gatherings of executives from several major institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Visa, MasterCard and BlackRock. The report estimates that 80 percent of banks around the world could start distributed ledger projects by next year. Large central banks are also studying how the blockchain will alter the way money moves around the globe. Most banks have already put together blockchain working groups and released research reports hailing the potentially transformative effect of the technology. But few real-world uses of the blockchain have come to fruition, other than Bitcoin itself. That has led to some questions about whether the blockchain is the proverbial solution looking for a problem, rather than an innovation that will be used widely. Existing virtual currencies have continued to struggle with security problems. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex, recently lost more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin in a hacking — the latest of several such incidents. The World Economic Forum report suggests that it will take some time for such problems to be worked out. In addition to the technology issues, the report says that the industry will have to work with governments to create standard rules and laws to govern transactions. The report does not make a single mention of Bitcoin. That mirrors the pronouncements from banks, which have often said that they can harness distributed ledgers without using existing virtual currencies. Rather, these ledgers would be run by groups of institutions that want to keep common records. Just this week, 15 global banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS, said that they had completed a prototype of a distributed ledger that could track trade financing around the globe — providing a single record for a series of scattered, hard-to-track transactions.",0.08380714285714284,0.06593556740878169

HSBC said that its profit dropped 40 percent in the second quarter and announced that it would follow up the sale of its Brazilian business last month with a share buyback of $2.5 billion. The quarterly results — which included a gain on the sale of its holdings in Visa Europe, charges related to the overhaul of its business and provisions for legal matters — showed a profit of $2.61 billion, compared with $4.36 billion the year before. Douglas Flint, the bank’s chairman, said that the need to reposition HSBC’s European business—after there is a decision on whether banks will be able to continue serving clients in the European Union from London— would “add to the very heavy workload already in place to address the regulatory and technological changes that are reshaping our industry.” Bitcoin Plunges After Exchange Is Hacked Another theft of Bitcoin has raised questions about the security of the digital currency and sent the money plummeting about 20 percent early on Wednesday morning in Hong Kong, where the exchange, Bitfinex, is based. About 120,000 Bitcoins were stolen, worth about $65 million even after the value of the currency dropped. The episode comes shortly after a hacker stole more than $50 million of Ether, another digital currency.

The exchange said it had halted trading, deposits and withdrawals while it investigated which users had been affected. Bitcoin’s trading value fell about 20 percent early on Wednesday, local time in Hong Kong, but had recovered about half the loss by early afternoon. Zane Tackett, Bitfinex’s director of community and product development, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But he said in a posting on Reddit that 119,756 Bitcoins had been stolen. Before the hacking was made public, that number of Bitcoins would have been worth about $72 million. Now that the currency has slumped, the figure is closer to $65 million. The exchange, one of the world’s largest, said in a blog post that any outstanding settlements would be made at the price before the hacking. “As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach,” Bitfinex said in the post. It added that customers’ losses would be addressed later. Security breaches of this type have raised questions about the viability of Bitcoin. The most notable episode was the collapse in 2014 of Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, in which hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins were stolen in a heist that experts and law enforcement officials are still trying to unravel. This past June, a hacker stole more than $50 million worth of Ether, another digital currency, from an experimental virtual currency project called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Jack Liu, chief strategy officer at OKCoin, a large digital currency exchange, said he was not concerned about the security of his company because it uses a different system. But he noted that there should be more discussion between exchanges over best practices. “We care about the health of the ecosystem,” he said, although he emphasized that nobody should be dictating how Bitcoins are secured. “Hackers are only getting better and so adoption of the same solution may not be the safest for the industry.” Although some view Bitcoin as the future of finance, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions, the Bitcoin community has been rived with infighting over the development of the technology. The blockchain ledger, part of the coding that underlies the currency, has also gained more mainstream traction, as banks see an opportunity to use the technology to speed up trades.

They had come to court the new kingmakers in one of the strangest experiments in money the world has seen: the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. Against long odds, and despite an abstruse structure, in which supercomputers “mine” the currency via mathematical formulas, Bitcoin has become a multibillion-dollar industry. It has attracted major investments from Silicon Valley and a significant following on Wall Street. Yet Bitcoin, which is both a new kind of digital money and an unusual financial network, is having something of an identity crisis. Like so many technologies before it, the virtual currency is coming up against the inevitable push and pull between commercial growth and the purity of its original ambitions. In its early conception, Bitcoin was to exist beyond the control of any single government or country. It would be based everywhere and nowhere. Yet despite the talk of a borderless currency, a handful of Chinese companies have effectively assumed majority control of the Bitcoin network. They have done so through canny investments and vast farms of computer servers dispersed around the country. The American delegation flew to Beijing because that was where much of the Bitcoin power was concentrated. At the time of the meeting, held at the Grand Hyatt hotel, over 70 percent of the transactions on the Bitcoin network were going through just four Chinese companies, known as Bitcoin mining pools — and most flowed through just two of those companies. That gives them what amounts to veto power over any changes to the Bitcoin software and technology. China has become a market for Bitcoin unlike anything in the West, fueling huge investments in server farms as well as enormous speculative trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. Chinese exchanges have accounted for 42 percent of all Bitcoin transactions this year, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Chainalysis. Just last week, the Chinese internet giant Baidu joined with three Chinese banks to invest in the American Bitcoin company Circle. But China’s clout is raising worries about Bitcoin’s independence and decentralization, which was supposed to give the technology freedom from the sort of government crackdowns and interventions that are commonplace in the Chinese financial world. “The concentration in a single jurisdiction does not bode well,” said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell and a Bitcoin researcher. “We need to pay attention to these things if we want decentralization to be a meaningful thing.” The power of Chinese companies has already come to play a major role in a civil war that has divided Bitcoin followers over the last year and led to the departure of one of the top developers of the virtual currency. The dispute has hinged on technical matters as well as on bigger questions of what Bitcoin should look like in 10 or 20 years. The American companies whose executives journeyed to the Grand Hyatt — including venture-capital-funded start-ups like Coinbase and Circle — are fighting to make Bitcoin bigger. They hope to expand the capacity of the Bitcoin network so that it can process more transactions and compete with the PayPals and Visas of the world. The current size of the network goes back to the early days, when Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the amount of data that could travel through the network, essentially capping it at about seven transactions a second. As Bitcoin has grown more popular, those limits have caused severe congestion and led to lengthy transaction delays. The American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that. The Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides. In a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall. “We kept coming back and saying, ‘For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,’” said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase. Ultimately, Mr. Armstrong said, “We were unable to convince them.” Some Bitcoin advocates have complained that the Chinese companies have been motivated only by short-term profit, rather than the long-term success and ideals of the project. Bobby Lee, chief executive of the Bitcoin company BTCC, which is based in Shanghai, bristled at that — and at the notion that the Chinese companies represent any sort of united front. He attended the April meeting and pointed out that the Chinese companies had disagreed among themselves on how urgent it was to make changes to the Bitcoin software. He said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day. “It was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do,” Mr. Lee said in an interview last week. “There has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.” The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the software in early 2009. It was designed to provide both a digital coin and a new way to move and hold money, much as email had made it possible to send messages without using a postal service. From the beginning, the system was designed to be decentralized — operated by all the people who joined their computers to the Bitcoin network and helped process the transactions, much as Wikipedia entries are written and maintained by volunteers around the world. The appeal of a group-run network was that there would be no single point of failure and no company that could shut things down if the police intervened. This was censorship-free money, Bitcoin followers liked to say. Decision-making power for the network resided with the people who joined it, in proportion to the computing power they provided. The allure of new riches provided the incentive to join: Every 10 minutes, new Bitcoins would be released and given to one of the computers helping maintain the system. In the lingo of Bitcoin, these computers were said to be mining for currency. They also served as accountants for the network. For the first few years, aside from its use as a payment method on the Silk Road, an online drug market that has since been shut down, Bitcoin failed to gain much traction. It burst into the world’s consciousness in 2013 when the price of the digital money began to spike, in no small part because Chinese investors began trading Bitcoins in large numbers. Mr. Lee said the Chinese took quickly to Bitcoin for several reasons. For one thing, the Chinese government had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets. Also, Mr. Lee said, the Chinese loved the volatile price of Bitcoin, which gave the fledgling currency network the feeling of online gambling, a very popular activity in China. There has been widespread speculation that Chinese people have used Bitcoin to get money out of the country and evade capital controls, but Mr. Lee and other experts said the evidence suggests this is not a significant phenomenon. “No Chinese person is pushing for Bitcoin because it’s libertarian or because it’s going to cause the downfall of governments,” said Mr. Lee, who moved to China after growing up in Africa and the United States and studying at Stanford. “This was an investment.” The extent of the speculative activity in China in late 2013 pushed the price of a single Bitcoin above $1,000. That surge — and the accompanying media spotlight — led China’s government to intervene in December 2013 and cut off the flow of money between Chinese banks and Bitcoin exchanges, popping what appeared to be a Bitcoin bubble. The frenzy, though, awakened interest in another aspect of the currency: Bitcoin mining. Peter Ng, a former investment manager, is one of the many people in China who moved from trading Bitcoins to amassing computing power to mine them. First, he mined for himself. More recently he has created data centers across China where other people can pay to set up their own mining computers. He now has 28 such centers, all of them filled with endless racks of servers, tangled cords and fans cooling the machines. Mr. Ng, 36, said he had become an expert in finding cheap energy, often in places where a coal plant or hydroelectric dam was built to support some industrial project that never happened. The Bitcoin mining machines in his facilities use about 38 megawatts of electricity, he said, enough to power a small city. The people who put their machines in Mr. Ng’s data centers generally join mining pools, which smooth the financial returns of smaller players. A popular one, BTCC Pool, is run by Mr. Lee’s company. This month it attracted about 13 percent of the total computational power on the Bitcoin network. The most powerful pool in China — or anywhere in the world — is known as F2Pool, and it had 27 percent of the network’s computational power last month. Big pool operators have become the kingmakers of the Bitcoin world: Running the pools confers the right to vote on changes to Bitcoin’s software, and the bigger the pool, the more voting power. If members of a pool disagree, they can switch to another pool. But most miners choose a pool based on its payout structure, not its Bitcoin politics. It was his role overseeing BTCC Pool that got Mr. Lee invited to the meeting with the American delegation in Beijing. The head of operations at F2Pool, Wang Chun, was also there. Perhaps the most important player in the Chinese Bitcoin world is Jihan Wu, 30, a former investment analyst who founded what is often described in China as the world’s most valuable Bitcoin company. That company, Bitmain, began to build computers in 2013 using chips specially designed to do mining computations. Bitmain, which has 250 employees, manufactures and sells Bitcoin mining computers. It also operates a pool that other miners can join, called Antpool, and keeps a significant number of mining machines for itself, which it maintains in Iceland and the United States, as well as in China. The machines that Bitmain retains for itself account for 10 percent of the computing power on the global Bitcoin network and are enough to produce new coins worth about $230,000 each day, at the exchange rate last week. Mr. Wu and the other mining pool operators in China have often seemed somewhat surprised, and even unhappy, that their investments have given them decision-making power within the Bitcoin network. “Miners are the hardware guys. Why are you asking us about software?” is the line that Mr. Ng said he often hears from miners. This attitude initially led most Chinese miners to align themselves with old-line Bitcoin coders, known as the core programmers, who have resisted changing the software. The miners wanted to take no risks with the money they were minting. But lately, Mr. Wu has grown increasingly vocal in his belief that the network is going to have to expand, and soon, if it wants to keep its followers. He said in an email last week that if the core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network. However the software debate goes, there are fears that China’s government could decide, at some point, to pressure miners in the country to use their influence to alter the rules of the Bitcoin network. The government’s intervention in 2013 suggests that Bitcoin is not too small to escape notice. Mr. Wu dismissed that concern. He also said that as more Americans buy his Bitmain machines and take advantage of cheap power in places like Washington State, mining will naturally become more decentralized. Already, he said, 30 to 40 percent of new Bitmain machines are being shipped out of China. For now, though, China remains dominant. “The Chinese government normally expects its businesses to obtain a leading role in emerging industries,” he said. “China’s Bitcoin businesses have achieved that.”",0.08850754716981132,0.07508030666049534

Michael J. de la Merced and Peter Eavis report in DealBook. Elon Musk, the chairman of SolarCity and chief of Tesla Motors, argued that it would create a renewable-energy giant, collecting clean electricity to propel cars. “I think it’s an obvious thing to do,” he said on Tuesday. He said it made sense, as Tesla had begun introducing rechargeable batteries for home use that can store electricity and smooth fluctuations in power grids. But his offer also highlighted the unusual moves that Mr. Musk has made to support the various arms of his empire, where he is the largest shareholder of each company. He has taken out loans to buy shares  in Tesla and SolarCity, some backed by his personal stock holdings in both companies — a risky decision that leaves him exposed to margin calls if their stock prices slide too far. He defended the practice as low-risk for other shareholders, given the sheer size of his personal net worth of more than $10 billion.  If an agreement were reached, it would still be some time away. Still, shareholders in SolarCity pushed the company’s stock up 19 percent in after-hours trading, to $25.26. Shares of Tesla, however, tumbled more than 13 percent, to $190.59. Both companies have grown fast and consumed enormous amounts of cash along the way. But SolarCity has been buffeted by changes in solar energy regulations — local policies have cut into the savings that solar providers have promised. Its troubles have left the company with a $2.6 billion in long-term debt and growing losses. Last year, interest payments on its debt equaled nearly a quarter of its sales. Tesla has had a better run of news, although its shares have also fallen over the past year. Analysts have also said that Tesla’s main business may be in batteries. It is expanding its $5 billion “Gigafactory” near Reno, Nev.  It may be able to help SolarCity generate more cash or reduce its cash consumption, but the solar company could be a burden. In theory, a combination of Tesla and SolarCity would have burned through nearly $5 billion of cash last year. Investors will have to be willing to lend to, or buy the stock of, a high-growth company consuming a lot of cash if they believe it will eventually generate healthy cash flows. 
 HEDGE FUND MANAGER CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING IS FOUND DEAD   |  Sanjay Valvani, a high-flying hedge fund manager at Visium Asset Management, has died, apparently the victim of a suicide,
Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook. Mr. Valvani was discovered by his wife in their brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, a police official said. He was face down on the bedroom floor with a cut to his neck and a knife near his body. He had left a note. He was 44 and is survived by two daughters.  Mr. Valvani was charged last week with insider trading and his death brought the government’s case against him to a shocking end. He was accused of using confidential information from a former Food and Drug Administration official to reap $32 million in illegal gains.  Barry H. Berke, a lawyer for Mr. Valvani, said the death was “a horrible tragedy that is difficult to comprehend.” The death is still being investigated and it is not known whether other factors could have affected Mr. Valvani’s state of mind.  Legal specialists said on Tuesday that they did not expect the death to cause prosecutors and Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, to back away from the case if they believed wrongdoing had occurred. “I don’t think he’s going to lose sleep over it, because it comes with the territory,” Thomas A. Sporkin, a lawyer at BuckleySandler and a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement lawyer, said.  The news of Mr. Valvani’s death on Tuesday stunned those who had worked with him on Wall Street.  In a statement, Visium’s founder, Jacob Gottlieb, said: “We mourn the tragic loss of Sanjay, a devoted father, husband and friend. Our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.”

 WHY LAW SCHOOL IS STILL A SOLID INVESTMENT  |  The rise in associate salaries at big law firms has brought a predictable but undeserved fresh round of law school bashing,
Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor. The increase has highlighted the dichotomy between those at the top and everyone else.  For the lucky few who get jobs at these firms, law school is a good investment. These young lawyers can earn more than $40,000 in one summer while they are still in law school and pay back their loans quickly. Many find that there are private firms willing to refinance their loans at rock-bottom interest rates.  But only about 17 percent of graduates earn salaries this high and to be in this group, you need to go to a top 10 school or graduate in the higher ranks of the top quartile of law schools.  It is tougher for other law graduates. While 17 percent of graduates earned a median salary of $160,000 in 2014, about half had a median starting salary of $40,000 to $65,000.  It is the fate of these graduates that drives the criticism of law school as a “scam.” They dream of big jobs, but are often the lawyers who become solo practitioners, district attorneys, public defenders and other lower-paying jobs.  Critics of law schools also focus on the number of law graduates who secured jobs as lawyers or jobs that preferred a law degree. According to American Bar Association figures analyzed by the Legal Whiteboard, for the 2015 class, the rate of employment was 70 percent. The bar passage rate also declined to about 75 percent so many law graduates could not practice law even if the jobs were there.  This has led to arguments that law school is not worth it for 90 percent of those who attend, but the criticisms ignore the fact that even lower-ranked law schools offer more good outcomes than bad.  The number of law firm jobs rose between 2007 and 2014, while law school enrollment dropped. Most law graduates secure employment that pays them more than they would otherwise have earned. The fact that lawyers do reasonably well over time and better than they would have done had they not gone to law school is reflected in the low default rates on law school loans, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes.     |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  SoftBank President Plans to Step Down  |  The president, Nikesh Arora, a former Google executive, disagreed with the chairman of the Japanese technology conglomerate on when Mr. Arora might take over.NYT » | Breakingviews: A Departure Leaves SoftBank’s Founder Firmly in Charge 2:34 PM

75,A Hacking of More Than $50 Million Dashes Hopes in the World of Virtual Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/business/dealbook/hacker-may-have-removed-more-than-50-million-from-experimental-cybercurrency-project.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-06-17T14:57:46+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A hacker on Friday siphoned more than $50 million of digital money away from an experimental virtual currency project that had been billed as the most successful crowdfunding venture ever — taking with him not just a third of the venture’s money but also the hopes and dreams of thousands of participants who wanted to prove the safety and security of digital currency. The attack most likely puts an end to the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which had raised $160 million in the form of Ether, an alternative to the digital currency Bitcoin. While the computer scientists involved in the project are aiming to tweak the code that underpins Ether in a way that will recover the money, the theft is nevertheless prompting a bigger debate about the viability and principles of virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether. “This is one of the nightmare scenarios everyone was worried about: Someone exploited a weakness in the code of the D.A.O. to empty out a large sum,” Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell who co-wrote a paper pointing out problems with the project, said on Friday. Central banks and financial firms have been exploring how to use the technology underlying virtual currencies — known as blockchain — to improve their own internal systems. The technology is considered to have advantages in terms of transparency and security. Just last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told central bankers at a trade industry conference that they should accelerate their efforts to explore blockchain. But the incident on Friday provided another reminder of how the code can be just as vulnerable to human greed and mistakes as paper bills. The D.A.O. was meant to be a standard-bearer for online currency ventures. It was funded by investors from around the world using Ether, which has become popular over the last year. But just before the project stopped raising money in late May, computer scientists pointed out several vulnerabilities in its underlying code — effectively warning that what happened to the experimental consortium would be possible or even likely. “The D.A.O. is being attacked,” Griff Green, a community organizer with the company that wrote the project’s software, Slock.it, wrote on a chat channel for the project Friday morning. “This is not a drill.” The money that the hacker moved appeared to be frozen on Friday as a result of a safeguard previously built into the code. The thief was caught in what might be thought of as a digital version of the airtight double doors that sometimes protect valuable sites (known in security circles as man traps). Programmers working on the Ethereum network, which hosts Ether, were debating on Friday whether to make a one-time change to the code to recover the frozen money. That faced immediate opposition from many virtual currency purists who were attracted to the technology because of its ostensible freedom from human meddling. “The strength of blockchain tech is that it is a ledger, a statement of truth,” Bruce Fenton, a board member with the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote on Friday. “That ledger is only as good as its resistance to censorship, change, demands or attack.” If the leaders of the Ethereum project decide to move forward with a change to the code — known as a fork — they will need to win the support of the people who lend their computing power to the network, and who have what amounts to a vote over any changes to the Ethereum software. The hacking on Friday underscored the complicated governance structure employed by so-called cryptocurrencies. These currencies are not run by any company or individual but by the computers of anyone who chooses to support the network. The D.A.O. was supposed to be a further extension of this concept of group decision-making. Thousands of people around the world financed the project by sending in Ether. The D.A.O. was supposed to act as a sort of venture capital fund, investing in projects that were voted upon by people who contributed money. The attack on Friday took place before any projects had been funded. The specific mechanism the hackers used is known as a recursive call vulnerability, — essentially a malicious transaction that moves money away from the D.A.O. into a side fund in an endlessly repeating loop. The attack led to chaos on the online message boards where D.A.O. investors and Ether users gather. “How can we help and protect our funds?” one user wrote on the Slack chat channel for D.A.O. investors. The programmers who wrote the D.A.O. code immediately suggested that investors vote to move their money to another, unrelated project known as Congo Split, primarily to protect their investments. “The community needs to spam the network so that it can mount a counterattack,” Stephan Tual, an employee with Slock.it, wrote on that company’s website. Programmers with Slock.it wrote the code for the D.A.O. but said they had no formal continuing role with the project. By the time it was over, the hacker had managed to gain control of 3.6 million Ether — more than a third of the 11.5 million that were there at the beginning of the day. “The D.A.O.’s journey is over,” Mr. Tual said in an email on Friday. The incident on Friday was a reminder of the dozens of hacking attacks and thefts that have rattled Bitcoin since it was released in early 2009. In 2014, Mt. Gox, which was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. The attacks on Bitcoin have generally led to a temporary lull in public interest in virtual currencies. But Bitcoin has bounced back each time. Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin has risen swiftly to the highest level since the Mt. Gox fiasco; it stood at $770 on Thursday night. Some of the recent demand for Bitcoin has come from anticipation of a coming event known as halving. Currently, the Bitcoin software releases 25 new coins — a block — every 10 minutes or so to computers helping support the network. In mid-July, the blocks will shrink to 12.5 coins. The shrinking supply has led some to assume that the price will go up. The price of Ether had been rising alongside Bitcoin over the last month, in part because of the interest generated by the D.A.O. On Thursday, both were up more than 60 percent over the previous month. But the attack Friday morning sent the price of Ether into a downward spiral. By Friday afternoon, the price of Ether had fallen 33 percent from its high a day earlier, to around $13. Bitcoin had also fallen, though less sharply, to around $750. The founder and lead programmer on the Ethereum project, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Friday that he supported a change to the code that would reclaim the money from the hacker. But he said he recognized that he might not win the argument. “I recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition,” Mr. Buterin wrote on Reddit. Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor, wrote: “There is no good solution here.”",0.02406212121212121,0.007489888058069877
76,Paper Points Up Flaws in Venture Fund Based on Virtual Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/business/dealbook/paper-points-up-flaws-in-venture-fund-based-on-virtual-money.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-28T00:04:49+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A group of computer scientists released a paper on Friday describing a number of security vulnerabilities in a novel cryptocurrency crowdfunding project that has raised more than $100 million. The authors of the paper argue that the money that has been put into the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, could be frozen or stolen by attackers as a result of flaws in the way that the venture, known as the D.A.O., was set up. The money is all in a digital currency called Ether, which is a newer alternative to Bitcoin and exists entirely online. The threats emerged on the eve of the organization’s move from fund-raising to operational mode, in which it will evaluate proposals to fund experimental digital projects. The D.A.O. is a sort of venture capital fund that will pick investments based on direct voting from investors. The entire operation is computerized, with no humans in charge. The authors of the new paper are calling for the D.A.O.’s investors to hold off on considering any potential investments until the vulnerabilities are fixed. “The current implementation can enable attacks with severe consequences,” according to the paper, written by the computer scientists Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir and Emin Gün Sirer. Mr. Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, has particular authority in the area because he previously was an author of a paper pointing out a serious vulnerability in the structure of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency. Mr. Gün Sirer said in an email on Friday that his team had decided to release the paper on the D.A.O. this week so that investors “will not be subject to attacks when the fund-raising deadline is over.” Mr. Gün Sirer said he sent the paper to the programmers who wrote the code underlying the D.A.O., and to some of the so-called curators on the project, who will help guide decisions in the venture. Christoph Jentzsch, who wrote the basic code, could not be reached for comment via email on Friday. Mr. Zamfir, one of Mr. Gün Sirer’s co-authors, is one of the 10 curators. Another curator, Alex Van de Sande, a programmer in Brazil, said on Friday that the authors “really raise some interesting attack vectors.” He said he did not see the attacks as an imminent threat, but he was hoping that investors would vote to make the structure of the D.A.O. more secure, potentially by dividing it into several smaller funds. The D.A.O. is built on Ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency network that was created to overcome some shortcomings in Bitcoin.The Ethereum system enables so-called smart contracts in which legal agreements can be written into computer code. It is those smart contracts that serve as the basis for decision making and investments within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The D.A.O. is motivated in large part by a broader desire to find more decentralized ways to make decisions and financial transactions, with fewer middlemen involved. After the organization began raising funds from investors in April, the surprising level of interest led investors to buy Ether – the virtual currency in the Ethereum network – to invest in the D.A.O. That drove up the price of Ether, which in turn drove up the value of Ether invested in the organization. As of last weekend, the aggregate value of Ether that had been sent to the venture by investors around the world was more than $150 million. More recently, several experts in the area have voiced concerns about the D.A.O., which has helped push down the price of Ether. On Friday, the value of the Ether in the D.A.O. was $131 million, even as the number of Ether invested had increased. The new paper points to several ways that bad actors could exploit the voting process that investors in the D.A.O. will use to choose investments. “At a fundamental level, these attacks all stem from unintended consequences of the mechanisms built into the D.A.O.” the paper says. “These problems can give rise to complex strategic behaviors, all resulting in a corruption of the intended, honest debate and voting process to select the most deserving proposals.”",0.058533333333333326,0.10068809791032013
77,Who’s Living in a ‘Bubble’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/magazine/whos-living-in-a-bubble.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-12-11,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"There’s a large spot reserved in the popular imagination for the Platonic ideal of an out-of-control market, a stunning collective enthusiasm that was bound to end in ruin: the tulip mania of the Netherlands, which ended in 1637. Tulips, a newly fashionable luxury item, temporarily became more valuable than houses — until, obviously, the inevitable market correction, which ruined fortunes and tore a nation apart. Except this is a myth: The historian Anne Goldgar, in her 2007 book on the topic, wrote that while tulip prices certainly got a bit silly in the 1630s, she could find no evidence of anyone going bankrupt over them. The tulip was simply a luxury commodity that underwent a brief upward swing in value. The more entertaining version was brought to us by the anti-tulip propaganda of the age: pamphlets spreading exaggerated tales about these wilting, decadent symbols of wealth and the ruin they brought with them. And yet the story of the tulips is still lodged in the modern mind as the perfect case study of a “bubble” — more so, even, than the South Sea Bubble, one of several speculative crazes of the early 18th century, in which British investors were thrown into panic by the rise and fall of a preposterously overvalued trading company. To this day, people use tulips to express their incredulity over inflated values. Last December, the investor Dennis Gartman appeared on CNBC and called the rising value of Bitcoin a “classic bubble” that, compared with tulip mania, “has gone even beyond that absurdity.” At a recent conference, the Italian economist Massimo Amato said the cryptocurrency was “like a virtual tulip.” The persistence of such comparisons probably has something to do with how effectively tulip mania works as a fable, with a flattering moral at its core: If the people around you seem to be behaving irrationally, perhaps you’re correct, and everyone else is deluded. Others are inside the “bubble,” incapable of spotting the distortions that are obvious to you. Of course houses are more valuable than flowers. Gartman and Amato, for instance, might have taken some grim satisfaction from what happened to Bitcoin in recent weeks: As of late November, it was trading at just over $3,700, down from a peak that neared $20,000, and the N.Y.U. economist Nouriel Roubini was tweeting about feeling “vindicated” that “this cryptobubble went bust for good.” The trouble is that financial bubbles turn out to be far harder to recognize than you might think. Economists have spent decades debating precisely what they are, and how an observer might spot one in the wild, without arriving at a clear consensus. The Nobel Prize-winning Robert J. Shiller, in his 2000 book “Irrational Exuberance,” considers them simple enough, but the equally Nobel Prize-winning Eugene Fama is skeptical of the very concept of a bubble, partly because he believes that it’s impossible to predict, mathematically speaking, whether you’re in one. Even after what looks like a catastrophic crash, value can rebound — as has happened in the past, many of the times Bitcoin has been declared doomed. The temptation to spot bubbles is widespread; the ability to actually identify them, less so. You could potentially blame a completely different kind of “bubble” for the once-soaring value of Bitcoin: the ideological enclave of cryptocurrency evangelists. In Forbes, Jason Bloomberg wrote that “most of the noise around both blockchain and crypto is little more than the community talking to itself — a massive ‘echo chamber.’ ” We like to imagine ourselves as cannily seeing through such echo chambers — the self-reinforcing intellectual snow globes of people who get all their information from one another, who imagine that all the world works like their particular corner of it. But we seem to have less faith in everyone else’s ability to do the same. Witness recent accusations that liberals live in a “coastal bubble,” full of coddled elites who understand more about avocados than about the crises of Rust Belt towns. Or the counteraccusation: that rural Americans have alarmingly little real exposure to people or lifestyles even slightly different from their own. In a September article at Washington Monthly, Nancy LeTourneau warned of an “information bubble” that was, according to one poll, leading 57 percent of strong Trump supporters to doubt that Democrats had a chance of capturing the House in midterm elections — calling back to the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez’s blogged 2010 warning that the conservative movement was “moving toward epistemic closure,” though not the liberal activist Eli Pariser’s 2011 book arguing that online “filter bubbles” were presenting us all with information that flattered our existing biases. If you’re trying to sort out why your ideological opponents seem, to you, so obviously foolish, here is one explanation that presents itself constantly. They are stuck in a “bubble,” unable to recognize any new information that doesn’t match their convictions — about life, about America, about politics, about the value of notional currencies, about the relative values of tulips and houses, about anything. But this, too, may be less clear-cut than it feels. Pariser’s notion of a “filter bubble” suggested that we were being divided by flaws in the infrastructure of the internet — things like personalization algorithms, which offer us precisely the information we’re already inclined to want — meaning we might solve the problem with better engineering. More recent research, though, has suggested that this may not be where the problem lies; the statistician Seth Flaxman, writing with other researchers in Public Opinion Quarterly, has found that the influence of search algorithms on individual browsing bias may not be as strong as it seemed. And while it’s often taken as a given that social media is politically polarizing, there’s evidence to suggest that the demographic groups that have polarized recently are the ones least likely to use social media. It’s obvious that Americans live in social bubbles — living and talking in circles divided by economics, race, ideology, geography, taste and so on. The problem arises as soon as you try to differentiate those that constitute real “bubbles” — which is to say, self-reinforcing spheres of blindness or irrationality — from those that might just as easily be called “cultures” or “communities,” groups of people who share experiences and convictions. Such groupings will certainly have drawbacks; our shared preconceptions often limit us. But to use the word “bubble” as a stand-alone pejorative is to focus on the ignorance inherent in a given worldview, rather than the insights; it’s to examine ideological opponents and conclude that the only reason they could possibly believe what they do is because they haven’t examined alternatives. It’s nice to imagine that we can broaden someone’s understanding of the world by illuminating their blind spots. The problem is that our helpful corrections are likely to be totally wrong. A well-meaning diagnosis of conservative bubbles like LeTourneau’s — “when everyone you know is a Republican,” she writes, “you can’t imagine anyone who isn’t” — might run up against complicated research results: say, one that indicates conservatives are actually better at modeling liberal beliefs than the other way around. The difficulty of getting it right might explain the overwhelming vindication people clearly feel when someone else’s ideological bubble really has been pricked. Less than two days after President Trump’s electoral victory, The New York Post published a column by Michael Goodwin that was positively triumphant about it: “The cluelessness in media and political circles about the Trump voter surge,” he wrote, “confirms that the ruling class is cosseted deeply in its bubbles and isolated from the concerns of other Americans.” So long as we’re not among a bubble’s inhabitants, its popping flatters our own delusion: that we’re among the few right-thinking people who accurately measure value, who accurately perceive reality, who see far more clearly than the sheeplike, tulip-loving half-wits around us. What might be more helpful, when talk of a “bubble” crops up, is to think of yourself, rather than others — to be vigilant about the possibility that the most meaningful bubbles are the ones you’re not aware of, rather than the ones you’re eager to spot. They are, after all, incredibly pleasant and convincing when you’re on the inside. The value they create is not an illusion: There is much to be gained from being in mental harmony with those around you, let alone owning something people are paying absurd prices for. It’s dispiriting, perhaps, to think our various blinkers might not be easy to identify, but knowing this offers a sort of peace — the peace of spending less time wondering why everyone else is so hopelessly blinkered. If you’re skeptical of your own ability to see everything clearly, you’ll be less surprised when the actions of others refuse to blow up in their faces — or, perhaps, when you hear your own world emit an unexpected pop.",0.12125581395348836,0.09666343669250645
78,Morning Agenda: Peter Thiel’s Secret War With Gawker,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/morning-agenda-peter-thiels-secret-war-with-gawker/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-26T10:19:03+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"PETER THIEL’S SECRET WAR WITH GAWKER  |  Peter Thiel, who helped found PayPal and was one of the earliest investors in Facebook, is waging war against Gawker Media,
Andrew Ross Sorkin reports in DealBook. In 2007, Gawker’s Valleywag blog published an article headlined, “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people,” and he has said posts that it has written about his friends and others have “ruined people’s lives for no reason.” The reporting drove him to fund a team of lawyers to find and help “victims” of its coverage in their cases against the publication.  “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,”  he said on Wednesday in his first interview since his identity was revealed. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.” He described his move as altruistic, saying it was “one of my greater philanthropic things that I’ve done.” “I can defend myself,” he explained. “Most of the people they attack are not people in my category. They usually attack less prominent, far less wealthy people that simply can’t defend themselves.” And so he helped Terry Bollea, also known as Hulk Hogan, to sue Gawker.  Mr. Thiel refused to divulge which other cases he has funded, but said, “It’s safe to say this is not the only one.”  Without revealing an exact figure, he said that estimates of $10 million in expenses so far were “roughly in the ballpark.” Mr. Thiel has donated  to the Committee to Protect Journalists and has often talked about protecting freedom of speech. He said he did not believe his actions were contradictory. But his role in funding cases has raised questions about the First Amendment as well as the role of big money in the court system.  While some are concerned about Mr. Thiel’s personal agenda, legal experts said that Mr. Thiel’s involvement did not change the case. “If you really do have concerns about the merits of this case, finding out who bankrolled it doesn’t really help you at all,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. Mr. Thiel’s involvement in the suit also brings the complicated relationship of Silicon Valley and the news media to the fore, David Streitfeld and Katie Benner write in The New York Times. The news broke just as the controversy over how Facebook shapes the news that its users see was dying down. Mr. Thiel is a Facebook board member. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Thiel.  As the technology world becomes ever more important and richer, tech companies have become less transparent about what they do. The world of Silicon Valley was often known primarily through its own promotion, until Valleywag challenged it. And now the Valley, or at least Mr. Thiel, is pushing back. “We should not be surprised that they act like entitled industrialists out here, because they are,” said Fred Turner, chairman of the department of communication at Stanford. “The way I’ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully,” said Mr. Thiel. “In a way, if I didn’t think Gawker was unique, I wouldn’t have done any of this. If the entire media was more or less like this, this would be like trying to boil the ocean.”  Felix Salmon, however,  argues in Fusion that Mr. Thiel has given “the world a master class in how a billionaire can achieve enormous ends with a relatively modest investment.”  “If Thiel’s strategy works against Gawker, it could be used by any billionaire against any media organization,” Mr. Salmon writes, adding that very few companies have the legal wherewithal to withstand such a barrage.  A judge on Wednesday denied Gawker’s motion seeking a new trial for the suit brought by Mr. Hogan, Les Neuhaus reports in The  Times.. Gawker now plans to appeal the original verdict.  
 CITIGROUP FINED IN RATE-RIGGING INQUIRY   |  Citigroup has become the latest big bank accused of trying to manipulate global interest rates,
Ben Protess and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced $425 million in penalties against Citigroup, covering two cases.  The bank faces no criminal charges and the Justice Department confirmed on Wednesday that it had closed its investigation into Citigroup and some of the other banks suspected of manipulating an interest rate benchmark known as the Isdafix.  The investigation centered on Citigroup’s attempts to manipulate a global benchmark rate, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix, that is crucial for valuing a wide range of products across financial markets. The rates are published daily for various interest rate derivatives contracts, which banks trade with other financial institutions and sell to clients looking to either hedge against a swing in interest rates or to speculate on the markets.  At the time of the misconduct, which ran from 2007 to 2012, Citigroup sat on a panel of banks that each submitted a bid for interest rate derivatives. An average of those submissions formed the Isdafix benchmark rate for that day. The trading commission said that rather than submitting an honest bid, Citigroup “made false reports” that skewed its submissions with the aim of benefiting its own trading positions at the expense of its trading partners’ and clients’.  In a separate benchmark fixing case, Citigroup agreed to resolve claims that it had tried to manipulate the Yen London Interbank Offered Rate and the Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. Citigroup’s role in trying to manipulate overseas benchmark rates tied to the pricing of interest rates and the use of derivatives products tied to those benchmarks has been no secret. In 2011, the Tokyo Financial Services Agency sanctioned Citigroup for its actions and temporarily suspended a derivatives product. In February, Citigroup agreed to pay $23 million to settle a lawsuit brought by several hedge funds and a public pension plan over claims that the bank had conspired to manipulate the yen Libor rate. “We will vigorously continue to investigate any efforts to manipulate financial benchmarks, and we will take action where possible to protect the integrity of these benchmarks,” Aitan Goelman, the trading commission’s enforcement director, said in a statement. Altogether, banks have paid more than $15 billion in penalties for the cases. Including the latest fines, Citibank alone has agreed to pay $735 million.

 MT. GOX CREDITORS SEEK TRILLIONS WHERE THERE ARE ONLY MILLIONS  |  People around the world are claiming they lost $2.4 trillion when Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy in 2014,
Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. That is about the annual economic output of France.  But the trustee overseeing the case said on Wednesday that only $91 million in assets have been tracked down to distribute to claimants. Mt. Gox has claimed just before its bankruptcy that it had more than $500 million in assets.  The numbers have linked another mystery to the currency that was devised to bring computer precision and traceability to money. It also shows that many dishonest people have been drawn to the fiasco around Mt. Gox and Bitcoin.  Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent more than two years trying to establish how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange and there have been few solid answers.  The amount that claimants have requested from the bankruptcy estate is absurd given that all the Bitcoins in the world today are worth about $7 billion, or 0.3 percent of the $2.4 trillion being claimed.  Most of that number is an outsize claim by one individual — but the rest of the claimants said they lost some $27 billion, or 54 times what the exchange claimed it held before it went under. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. They will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims. The legal and accounting costs have added up to about $55 million so far.  Mt. Gox was the most prominent company during Bitcoin’s early, Wild West years, and became one of the first widely used places to exchange dollars or euros for Bitcoin. It was run from Tokyo by a young Frenchman named Mark Karpeles who had no experience working with financial software. He filed for bankruptcy after months of unexplained behavior. He initially said he could not locate 850,000 Bitcoins, worth about $450 million at the time, but later said that he had found 200,000 in misplaced digital wallets.  Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  AT&T Wants Yahoo’s Internet Business  |  While Verizon remains a favorite to acquire Yahoo, it didn’t submit one of the highest first-round bids, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter.BLOOMBERG

79,Mt. Gox Creditors Seek Trillions Where There Are Only Millions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/mt-gox-creditors-seek-trillions-where-there-are-only-millions.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-26T00:25:11+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"$2,411,412,137,427. That figure — $2.4 trillion for those with an untrained eye for very large numbers — is in the same ballpark as the annual economic output of France. It is also exactly the amount that people around the world claim they lost when Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy in 2014, after huge, unexplained losses of the volatile digital currency Bitcoin. As with most of the people who lost money with Bernard L. Madoff, the investment manager who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, most of those who put their Bitcoin in Mt. Gox will be disappointed: The Japanese trustee overseeing the case said on Wednesday that only $91 million in assets has been tracked down to distribute to claimants — a small portion of the more than $500 million in assets that Mt. Gox claimed it had in the weeks before it went bankrupt in February 2014, and a tiny portion of the amount that claimants have requested. The giant gaps between those numbers are an indication, if nothing else, of the sheer number of dishonest people who have been drawn to the fiasco around Mt. Gox and Bitcoin. They are also the latest reminders of the topsy-turvy nature of the digital-currency realm. A currency designed to bring computer precision and traceability to money has been marked by multiple unsolved mysteries swirling around it. Journalists and others have made many unsuccessful attempts to determine the true identity of the creator of the Bitcoin technology, a programmer or group of programmers going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent over two years trying to figure out how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange. There have been lots of conspiracy theories but few solid answers. The amount that claimants have requested from the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate is absurd on its face, given that all the Bitcoins in the world today are worth about $7 billion, or 0.3 percent of the $2.4 trillion being claimed. Most of that huge number is an outsize claim by one individual — but even after that is taken out, the rest of the claimants said they lost some $27 billion, or 54 times what the exchange claimed it held before it went under. The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. Each of those claimants will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations. Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims, not to mention the legal and accounting costs. The trustee reports that those costs have added up to about $5.5 million so far. “I am disturbed by the amount of money which the bankruptcy process has burned through,” Kolin Burges, one of the most outspoken creditors, said on Wednesday. “We have seen very poor results from the investigations, and the details have been constantly shrouded from the creditors.” Mt. Gox’s collapse in 2014 threatened to destroy the cottage industry that was built around Bitcoin in the years after it was released in early 2009. The price that people were willing to pay for Bitcoin steadily declined for over a year after the bankruptcy. But the problems in Tokyo also led to a professionalization of the virtual currency world, with established entrepreneurs and venture capitalists getting involved and regulators establishing basic rules for businesses in the industry. These days, many banks are examining how to harness the technology underlying Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, though Bitcoin itself has been hurt by infighting among the developers working on the technology. Mt. Gox was the most prominent company during Bitcoin’s early, Wild West years, as it became one of the first widely used places to exchange dollars or euros for Bitcoin. The company was run from Tokyo by a young Frenchman named Mark Karpeles, who had essentially no experience working with financial software. The exchange suffered several breakdowns and attacks, but many customers still kept their money there. Mr. Karpeles filed for bankruptcy after months of unexplained behavior. While he initially said the exchange could not locate 850,000 Bitcoins — worth about $450 million at the time — he later reported to the court that he had found 200,000 Bitcoins in misplaced digital wallets. Those 200,000 Bitcoins form the bulk of the money that the bankruptcy trustee will return to Mt. Gox customers. In an unusual step, the trustee has indicated that he will allow valid claimants to be paid in Bitcoin rather than yen or dollars. Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. This week, the trustee said he was helping with the “ongoing criminal investigation” of Mr. Karpeles. Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. A Tokyo computer security company, WizSec, has published reports on its own private investigation of the money using the blockchain ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. WizSec has said it appears that Bitcoins began disappearing from Mt. Gox back in 2011 and continued being transferred out of the exchange in small amounts over time. The researchers believe that the thief altered Mt. Gox’s internal records so that Mr. Karpeles did not realize the money was gone. “The unfortunate reality of Bitcoin is that it’s just so tempting to steal it digitally,” Kim Nilsson, a researcher with WizSec, said on Wednesday. Mr. Nilsson says he lost a few thousand dollars with Mt. Gox, some of which he hopes to recover from the estate. Mr. Nilsson said he no longer trusted his Bitcoin to anyone other than himself. But he says he is as excited as ever about the virtual currency, in part because of the way that the blockchain made it possible for individuals like him to do their own investigation of the Mt. Gox collapse. “Thanks to the blockchain, everyone has an equal starting point,” he said. “It’s possible to crowdsource forensic investigations.”",-0.09042131147540983,0.05743603087865384
80,"A Venture Fund With Plenty of Virtual Capital, but No Capitalist",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/business/dealbook/crypto-ether-bitcoin-currency.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-22T00:00:18+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Olivier Stern, a 31-year-old French socialist with an appetite for risk, recently invested a third of his life savings — 10,000 euros, about $11,000 — in a cryptocurrency start-up that has no legal standing and runs head-on into regulatory obstacles, yet might very well upend the mysterious world of virtual investing. The start-up, a sort of venture capital fund that calls itself the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, has essentially come out of nowhere in the last month and attracted about $152 million, at last count, from investors around the world like Mr. Stern — making it the most successful crowdfunded venture ever, by a significant margin. The venture, like so many things related to the digital currencies that cryptographers are creating on the Internet, is difficult to describe, and it may not be legal. But thousands of mostly anonymous investors have already heard about it through word of mouth and sent money — in the form of Ether, a freshly coded form of currency that has held itself out as a new and improved version of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual scrip. For these investors, in some sense it is the digital equivalent of buying into a bakery with no baker, no menu and no assurance that the ovens will even be delivered. But among the crowd that has invested, faith in the computer code that governs the project appears strong enough to override all those concerns. After it collects Ether from investors — the deadline to buy in is May 28 — the D.A.O. aims to put the money into other digital currency start-ups. The investing decisions are to be made through online polling of shareholders like Mr. Stern, who has a day job dealing with parking policy in the town of Montreuil, just outside Paris. “I think it is the beginning of something that could, in a way, make history,” said Mr. Stern, who previously lost a small sum of money he invested in Bitcoin when a major Bitcoin exchange — Mt. Gox — went bust. “Maybe it can fail, maybe it can succeed, but for sure it is an idea that is very interesting.” The rise of the new venture comes at a time when the technology underlying virtual currencies is rapidly being embraced by the mainstream: Most Wall Street firms and many central banks are experimenting with the blockchain, the online ledger system that Bitcoin and Ether pioneered. Banks hope the blockchain, or something like it, can provide a faster, cheaper way of conducting transactions and storing data. The D.A.O., on the other hand, returns to the more radical ambitions of virtual currencies. It is set up according to computer code, with no human executives. All decisions will be made by votes of the people who buy in — using software — making it a sort of technology-enabled leaderless collective. The basic code was written by a 32-year-old German programmer, Christoph Jentzsch. But he is not set to have any continuing role, and the D.A.O. does not hold the money of investors; instead, the investors own D.A.O. tokens that give them rights to vote on potential projects. Mr. Jentzsch said on Wednesday in an interview that he thought the structure absolved him of any legal responsibility for what could happen with the project. “Of course this venture is fraught with risks,” Mr. Jentzsch said in an email. But he also predicted, “This technology represents the future of the Internet.” Experts on virtual currencies say that Mr. Jentzsch and others involved have stepped into dangerous regulatory legal territory. American regulators have previously come down hard on entrepreneurs who sold investments using virtual currencies. Patrick Murck, a lawyer who has long dealt with Bitcoin issues, said that even if Mr. Jentzsch and his collaborators were not operating the venture, they could face legal liability for promoting it if the investments go awry — and, potentially, even if they don’t. “You can’t code away your legal responsibilities,” said Mr. Murck, who is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard. “This is something that has been tried before and has failed before.” As of Wednesday, an Ether was valued at $13 and a Bitcoin at $450 — evidence, perhaps, of the strangeness and subjectivity of these new currencies. The D.A.O.’s reliance on Ether has allowed people to send their money to it from anywhere in the world without providing any identifying information, a design that is already raising concerns about potential money laundering. The D.A.O. has also faced difficult questions from virtual currency aficionados, who worry that the organization’s code was put together relatively hastily without the sort of security testing that has preceded previous projects based on Ethereum, the technology platform that underpins Ether. “It’s an unstable thing right now,” said Joseph Lubin, who was one of the founders of Ethereum. “Young, complex machines tend to have flaws and vulnerabilities that you can’t anticipate.” Mr. Jentzsch acknowledged that he did not anticipate the venture growing to anything close to the size it has reached. The biggest similar projects have attracted a few million dollars. “If I would have known the size it has grown to, maybe the tester in me would say, ‘I need more testing,’” he said. “This is very risky. It’s all new land.” So far, two projects have applied to the D.A.O. for funding. One of them is a company run by Mr. Jentzsch and his brother, Simon, that is creating a new kind of physical lock that can be controlled remotely through the Ethereum network, according to contracts written into the network. The code that Mr. Jentzsch wrote for the organization has several safeguards that would make it hard for him or anyone else to game the voting of shareholders to win investments. But even successful crowdfunding sites do not have a great track record of harnessing the enthusiasm of users to pick good investments. The creator of a now defunct crowdfunding site fueled by Bitcoin, BitShares, wrote a biting online post on Tuesday arguing that the D.A.O. would most likely fail for the same reason that BitShares ultimately failed: “people problems, economic problems and political problems.” “My opinion is that the D.A.O. will be D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival),” Daniel Larimer, the founder of BitShares, wrote. “The theory of jointly deciding to fund efforts will face the reality of individual self-interest, politics and economics.” The possibility of failure did not deter Mr. Stern, the Frenchman who put in the equivalent of $11,000. He said he thought the D.A.O. would provide a good financial return, but he was also motivated by his belief that the venture is an experiment in a new way of organizing companies, and potentially even governments. “It’s important for people to propose and try an alternative,” he said.",0.06447666666666667,0.06358910533910535

The campaign plans to put in place a transition team  to prepare for a Trump administration and has announced Steve Mnuchin, the chairman and chief of Dune Capital Management, as national finance chairman.  “Steven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “He brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.”  Bloomberg reports that Mr. Mnuchin said he had been asked to join the campaign after Mr. Trump won the New York primary. “He’s bringing a lot of people into the party who have not been part of the party in the past,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “Donald’s appeal is way beyond the traditional political candidates, and what he stands for and represents is a completely new approach.”  The two men have done business together, but Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment further on the nature of their dealings. He said he liked Mr. Trump’s economic platform, including his plan to simplify the tax code.  Mr. Trump had excoriated hedge fund managers for “getting away with murder” with their use of the carried interest loophole, which gives private equity firms and hedge fund managers preferential tax treatment. Mr. Mnuchin also declined to comment on that, but he did say he had received calls from fellow hedge fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support.  Mr. Mnuchin has, like Mr. Trump, given money to the Democrats. He contributed more than $7,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate bids in 2000 and 2006, according to federal contribution data on OpenSecrets, Politico reports. He also contributed $2,000 to Barack Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign and $2,300 for his presidential bid in 2007.  In all, he has donated more than $120,000 over the past two decades to both Democratic and Republican candidates, with about $64,000 going to Democratic candidates. 
 ENERGY TRANSFER SEES A WAY OUT OF ITS DEAL WITH WILLIAMS  |  Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of Energy Transfer Equity, thinks he may have found a way to get out of an ironclad merger agreement with Williams Companies,  Leslie Picker reports in DealBook. His efforts so far have only got him and the company sued.  The company’s outside legal adviser, Latham & Watkins, has said it was unable to provide a certain tax opinion, a condition needed to close the deal. So on Thursday, on a conference call to discuss Energy Transfer’s quarterly earnings, Mr. Warren said, “We can’t close. We don’t have a transaction that can close.”  “Absent substantial restructuring of this transaction, which Energy Transfer has been very willing and actually desiring to do, absent that, we don’t have a deal,” he added. This talk may just be theater. Williams has not received a new proposal from Energy Transfer to restructure the deal, according to people briefed on those discussions. Williams has not received a termination notice either.  Because of the market declines in the energy sector since the deal was signed, Williams’s assets are now valued at far less than the $6 billion in cash its shareholders would receive from Energy Transfer, according to  Latham’s argument. This could prompt the Internal Revenue Service to require them to recast the transactions, making the assets suddenly taxable. Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the legal team for Williams, said it did not think recasting was necessary.  Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant said the I.R.S. would focus on the values that existed at the time the deal was signed, in September, as opposed to now.  Mr. Willens said the issues that Latham raised were “not just totally hogwash,” but did say, “Now that we’re seeing such a dichotomy of opinion between the two law firms, people can’t help but think Latham is bending over backward to help their client.”

 A TUSSLE OVER LAW SCHOOL’S ACCEPTANCE OF GRE TEST SCORES  |  Arizona law school began accepting applicants who had taken only the more general GRE graduate admissions exam instead of the traditional Law School Admissions Test this week. The shift has engaged the legal profession’s gatekeepers in a fierce debate,
Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook. The move prompted a scolding from the Law School Admissions Council, which warned that it might expel the school from its network.  On Wednesday, about 150 law school deans, including Martha Minow from Harvard and Robert Post from Yale, expressed their support for Arizona in a letter to the council. They argued that “experimentation benefits all of us” and that kicking out Arizona “is unwarranted under the existing rules and sends a terrible message to law schools about experimentation in the admissions process.”  The tussle highlights a growing frustration in legal academia. Some law school deans see the standardized test as an impediment to their reaching new groups of potential applicants who could become law students. Critics of the LSAT say it is less useful than the GRE — it is a written exam and is offered only four times a year. The GRE is given by computer and offered more frequently during the year.  Kathryn Rubino, an editor at the legal industry blog Above the Law, wrote in a post that the law council “has managed to consolidate quite a bit of the power in the law school admissions game, and they are not looking to share that anytime soon.” Marc L. Miller, the dean of Arizona’s law school, said it had received about 30 applications from GRE test-takers, and, so far, it has admitted three of them for the class entering this fall. And there could be more. He also wrote a letter to the council, noting that curbing the school’s admissions policy could raise antitrust issues because restrictions “unreasonably restrain(s) the competition on law school admissions testing market.”    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Sanofi Trades Volleys With Medivation in $9.3 Billion Offer  |  The French drug maker said it believed it had “overwhelming support” from Medivation’s shareholders for a merger, and Medivation still said no.NYT »

82,Australian Ends Attempt to Prove He Founded Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/dealbook/australian-ends-attempt-to-prove-he-founded-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-05T17:13:01+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"LONDON — The mystery behind who created the online currency Bitcoin deepened on Thursday. Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and computer programmer who earlier this week said he was that person, on Thursday withdrew an offer to prove his assertion, removing the contents of his blog and replacing it with a post simply titled, “I’m sorry.” “I believed that I could do this,” Mr. Wright wrote on his blog. “I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.” Mr. Wright was first identified as Bitcoin’s founder in December 2015 by Wired magazine and the technology website Gizmodo, but he did not come forward then. This week that changed, and he said in interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ that he was the digital currency’s creator, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Almost as soon as Mr. Wright announced he was the creator of Bitcoin on Monday, skepticism surfaced in the Bitcoin community about the authenticity of his claims. In a news release on Monday, Mr. Wright said that he had decided to make his identity public to “dispel any negative myths and fears about Bitcoin.” “I cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of Bitcoin” and the blockchain, the currency’s communal digital ledger, he said at the time. “I’m now able to build on what I have previously completed by releasing my research and academic work and help people understand just how powerful this can really be.” Outside Organization, a public relations company that distributed his release on Monday, verified that the comments on the blog were from Mr. Wright and did not provide any additional comment on Thursday. Bitcoin was founded as a digital competitor to existing currencies, and it has gained traction as financial institutions and others have begun researching how they can use the blockchain technology to improve transactions. The currency is created by people using computers to solve complex math problems, and it can then be traded digitally. Each coin is associated with its owner by a digital key. The mysterious identity of its founder created an aura around the digital currency since it surfaced in 2009 and fueled a parlor game of speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto’s identify. Satoshi Nakamoto communicated only by electronic message and never revealed his or her true identity before ending all communication in 2011. To verify his assertions this week, the BBC said, Mr. Wright provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk-through of how to verify cryptographic keys. All of that information was wiped from his blog on Thursday. “When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked,” Mr. Wright said on his blog on Thursday. “When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.” In his post on Thursday, Mr. Wright apologized to Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Gavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer. Both men said on Monday that, after reviewing evidence provided by Mr. Wright, they believed that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. “I can only hope that their honor and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions,” Mr. Wright said on his blog. “They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I’m sorry.” After the Wired and Gizmodo articles last year, Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright’s home in a suburb of Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. Tax authorities in Australia said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto. On Thursday, Mr. Wright seemed determined to return to the shadows, ending his post with the words, “And goodbye.”",0.05368536585365853,-0.02726656812022666
83,"He’s Bitcoin’s Creator, He Says, but Skeptics Pounce on His Claim",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-craig-wright-satoshi-nakamoto.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-05-02T09:02:03+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"An Australian entrepreneur claimed on Monday to be the creator of the online currency Bitcoin. Within hours, the skepticism started. Whether the truth is ultimately uncovered, the hunt for the founder’s identity is part of the new reality of the online age. A vast array of new tools and technologies make it ever easier to hide in the vast digital ocean that is the Internet — and all the more difficult to put a face to every screen name. The identity debate is crucial for Bitcoin as those in the virtual currency community take sides over its direction. Some purists want to maintain Bitcoin’s outsider status, underscored by the mystique surrounding its founder. Others see an opportunity to expand Bitcoin into the commercial realm, making it more vulnerable to speculation and uncertainty. Craig Steven Wright, the computer programmer who claimed in interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ to be the currency’s progenitor, said that he had come forward to quell the rumors. While Mr. Wright was first identified as Bitcoin’s founder in December 2015 by Wired magazine and the technology website Gizmodo, he remained silent then. Mr. Wright said that he now wanted to “dispel any negative myths and fears” about the virtual currency. “I cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of Bitcoin,” he said. He didn’t offer further insight in the timing of his announcement. And he declined an interview request through a representative at the Outside Organisation, a public relations company. If his claims prove true, Mr. Wright could help shape the debate over the future of Bitcoin. The direction of the virtual currency is at an impasse ahead of a major Bitcoin conference on Monday. But many technical experts, including some of the leading Bitcoin developers, said that Mr. Wright’s evidence did not prove he was the digital currency’s creator, identified by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. “It would take the real Satoshi about five minutes to provide conclusive proof to the entire Bitcoin community, if the real Satoshi wanted to do that,” said Joseph Bonneau, a researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University. Then there were the enthusiasts who sought to play down the importance of the founder’s identity. The creator, they argued, has remained anonymous for years and the currency’s popularity has grown regardless. Mr. Wright is “a lot like those very difficult geek/nerd/blatherers that turn minor I.T. support into a social drama,” Ian Grigg, a crypto-currency researcher, wrote in a blog entry. “Satoshi was more than a name, it was a concept, a secret, a team, a vision. Now Satoshi lives on in a new form — changed,” he added. “Much of the secret is gone, but the vision is still there.” In the world of cybercrimes and encryption, finding the human behind the computer is the exception, not the rule. The leaker of the Panama Papers, the trove of documents that exposed offshore accounts used by the rich and powerful, remains anonymous. The digital culprits who stole more than $80 million from Bangladesh’s central bank remain at large. And there is still no concrete indication of the perpetrators of the hack against Sony in 2014. The creator of the illicit Internet market called the Silk Road, known in part for its reliance on Bitcoin, was confirmed only by an operation in which he was grabbed at a San Francisco library with his laptop open. Before that, all that was known about him was an intriguing screen name: Dread Pirate Roberts. The latest twist in Bitcoin’s origins story is likely to feed the power vacuum that has plagued the virtual currency. While a decentralized nature is at Bitcoin’s core, it has also led to internal reflection over its evolution. Bitcoin’s longtime backers have recently split over the proper way to expand the network. Founded as a digital competitor to existing currencies, Bitcoin has moved more into the mainstream of late. Financial institutions are putting resources into researching how they can use the blockchain, the currency’s communal digital ledger, to make transactions faster and cheaper. Competition, too, has risen, with a host of new virtual currencies, like Ethereum. And the growth of the Bitcoin system has stalled. The mystery of Bitcoin’s founder has been central to its cachet ever since it surfaced in 2009. Yet the creator has also been mostly silent since Bitcoin rose to prominence. If Mr. Wright’s claims can be confirmed, they open a whole new set of issues for Bitcoin. Does its creator have more power than others who have played a major role in its development? If the founder asserts authority over its direction, does that undercut the very power of the currency as a decentralized system? Mr. Wright’s revelation was made just before a large Bitcoin conference began in New York on Monday. After the announcement, the price of Bitcoin fell about $10. Satoshi, as the creator became known, communicated only by electronic message and never revealed his or her true identity before cutting off all communication in 2011. That has led to frequent speculation about the identity of Satoshi — speculation that has so far proved wrong. In perhaps the most notable case, Newsweek claimed in 2014 that the founder was Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living in California. The revelation fueled a reporter-driven car chase of Mr. Nakamoto across Los Angeles, an indication of the tabloid-level curiosity behind Bitcoin’s originator. Dorian Nakamoto eventually denied being the Bitcoin founder. If Mr. Wright is perpetrating a hoax, it is a rather elaborate one. To back up his claims, the BBC said Mr. Wright had provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk through of how to verify cryptographic keys. “I didn’t take the decision lightly to make my identity public,” Mr. Wright said in a news release, “and I want to be clear that I’m doing this because I care so passionately about my work.” Soon after the stories were published in Wired and Gizmodo, the Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright’s home in suburban Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. The Australian tax authorities said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto. Gavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer, wrote Monday on his blog that he believed Mr. Wright’s claim. Mr. Andresen has pushed for a bigger Bitcoin, a strategy Mr. Wright also appears to back. “After spending time with him, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi,” Mr. Andresen wrote. “During our meeting, I saw the brilliant, opinionated, focused, generous — and privacy-seeking — person that matches the Satoshi I worked with six years ago. But the Bitcoin community was not in consensus. Another of the leading developers working on Bitcoin’s basic software, Gregory Maxwell, said that the evidence presented by Mr. Wright was not enough to convince him. “It demonstrates no connection between this person and Bitcoin’s creation,” Mr. Maxwell wrote in an email to the Times. A programmer who is in charge of the Bitcoin discussion boards, Michael Marquardt, wrote on Reddit — under the screen name “theymos” — that Mr. Wright’s new writings suggest an effort to deceive the public. And the main Reddit page dedicated to Bitcoin was full of discussion on Monday about the legitimacy of Mr. Wright’s claims. “Altogether, the weight of the new evidence tips the scales very little, and the scales were already stacked against him being Satoshi,” said Jeremy Clark, an assistant professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering in Montreal.",0.05553734939759036,0.05345717284723308

The likelihood of incurring huge legal fees to secure money transmission licenses in all 50 states makes it that much harder. Yet that is what some digital currency start-ups face as a result of a bewildering hodgepodge of regulations across state and national lines that can make it difficult even to know which rules apply. Hoping to remove at least some of the burden, government agencies in the United States and elsewhere have been increasing their efforts to update the regulations. Last week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, unveiled a white paper that it said was a first step in helping foster innovation in financial tech, particularly for businesses tied to existing banks. “Not every innovation is appropriate for a regulated financial institution, and not every innovation that is appropriate for a regulated institution is appropriate for all regulated institutions,” Thomas J. Curry, the comptroller, said in remarks. “But avoiding new approaches completely is equally dangerous.” Many of the existing laws apply to older forms of finance like Western Union, the money-transfer company founded 165 years ago to capitalize on telegraph technology. The lack of fresh rules today means that modern fintech start-ups must also adapt to 19th-century regulations. And states have their own rules. In Wyoming, for instance, digital currency start-ups must maintain enormous amounts of capital reserves to operate there. “There is no regulation that is focused specifically on fintech,” said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group for digital currencies like Bitcoin. “What happens is that there are places where tech has outpaced the law.” The white paper follows some previous efforts by regulators to revise the rules. Last year, the Treasury Department sought information about marketplace lending, which matches borrowers and lenders over the Internet using algorithms. This year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlined a new policy meant to give start-ups more confidence in introducing financial products without fear of a regulatory rebuke, at least initially. Existing rules make it difficult to guess which regulations apply to which firms. Take multisignature technology, in which wallets holding digital currencies like Bitcoin have authorization “keys” held by different parties. No transaction involving that money can take place without the consent of at least two of the key holders. Whether digital wallet companies can do anything with those deposits in the meantime, as insurance companies do when they invest their unpaid premiums, remains an open question. Some big banks, while arguing that they are embracing financial tech, want regulations for the new companies that are equal to what the banks face. Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this year that disruptions to the payments system would be costly and that regulators must work to ensure that the industry can run smoothly. As William Winters, the chief of Standard Chartered Bank, put it during that panel, “As long as it’s a level playing field, it’s O.K.” For some companies in the fintech business, that is not a problem. Take Prosper, an early entrant in the marketplace-lending industry. The company has worked to comply with regulations on both sides of its business, its executives said. Investors in the loans it assembles are protected by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as regulators in 31 states. Borrowers on Prosper’s platform are covered by traditional banking rules, since Prosper technically teams with WebBank of Utah to disburse its loans. “It’s the same framework that applies to any bank lending program,” Sachin Adarkar, Prosper’s general counsel, said in an interview. Other governments have been starting their own initiatives. Britain unveiled Project Innovate last year to establish ways for start-ups to introduce services under the eye of government agencies. The European Union allows companies that hold a license in one country to “passport” it to other members of the bloc. Allowing something similar in the United States would most likely require action from Congress. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, has said that Republicans plan to introduce legislation meant to modernize rules and let fintech innovation flourish. But analysts say that such a move could face resistance. “It would be politically difficult,” Mr. Brito said. “What you would be doing is challenging or removing authority of many different state regulators.” That makes it unlikely that the bramble of regulations will go away soon.",0.14968333333333333,0.014961887392442943
85,Ripple Aims to Put Every Transaction on One Ledger,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/ripple-aims-to-put-every-transaction-on-one-ledger.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-04-06T17:43:45+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Chris Larsen started with a vision of making it possible for, say, a goatherd in Central Asia to do business efficiently with a fisherman in Africa or a merchant in London. But now he has tweaked the idea into something that could play a role in transforming the international financial system — and the world beyond. “We’re heading for a day when every device in the world might be an economic actor,” said Mr. Larsen, who made a fortune as a pioneer in online lending and founded Ripple, an Internet technology company. “It starts by being in the sewer system of finance.” The big banks at the center of global money movement, coordinating cash transfers for companies paying overseas suppliers, would not enjoy the comparison to a network of underground tunnels and pipes that carry waste. Yet while mail, music and movies travel fast online, older-style money transactions remain slow, creaky and clogged. It can take days for someone in the United States to pay someone in Africa. Ripple and several other companies working in the online world aim to fix that with a technology known by the yawn-producing term “distributed ledger.” Its possibilities are anything but dull, however: Mr. Larsen imagines that the technology could go far beyond accommodating financial transactions among people and eventually enable self-driving cars to pay for tolls, parking and fuel without the help of humans. Home energy meters with ledgers might buy different sources of energy. Jet engines could record the installation of new parts and pay for maintenance on the spot. Like many things in tech, a distributed ledger is a seemingly complex idea that is actually built on a very simple one. Since the dawn of record-keeping, ledgers have been where receipts and disbursements of cash and goods are recorded. If you buy a sandwich at a deli, for example, several ledgers come into play. The money you carry to pay for it registers a slight deduction on your personal ledger. The deli owner’s ledger records a gain in one place and in another a payment for the ham it bought from a supplier. A ledger at the bank records the deposit it receives from the deli owner. In a world where every business has its own books, payments tend to stop and start between different ledgers. An overseas transfer leaves the ledger of one business, then goes on another ledger at a domestic bank. It then might hit the ledger of a bank in the international transfer system. It travels to another bank in the foreign country, before ending up on the ledger of the company being paid. Each time it moves to a different ledger, the money has a different identity, taking up time and potentially causing confusion. For some companies, it is a nightmare that can’t end soon enough. “Why should it take me 48 hours to make a foreign currency payment?” said David Morton, chief financial officer of Seagate Technology, a major manufacturer of computer data storage devices. “I have 10,000 suppliers and handle 100,000 invoices a month. If I could pay people immediately, what kind of a discount would I get?” In other words, what if one ledger could be shared among all the people in a transaction, who would agree on a common database of value that would do away with the need for currency exchanges? The actions would be recorded securely, with each participant able to see only the parts he needed to see. None of the middlemen would be needed, and payments could happen much faster. That is the idea behind a distributed ledger. Seagate has invested in Ripple and is testing the technology. The distributed ledger is best known as the underlying system that makes possible Bitcoin, the stateless cryptocurrency. Bitcoin got a bad name as a wildly fluctuating currency for drug dealers and tax cheats, in part because its participants remained anonymous. But many banks and businesses say the underlying ledger technology, if it is secure and transparent, can be more efficient than our current methods. “Banks are struggling with different regulations, fragmented systems and siloed practices,” said Owen Jelf, global managing director for capital markets at Accenture, which has also worked with Ripple. “We’re excited about this as a technology to make things more efficient.” Accenture has made several bets on the technology. Aside from Ripple, it has invested in the distributed ledger company Digital Asset Holdings, and it is working with clients in financial trading on using the technology. Another distributed ledger platform, called Ethereum, works off the same technology that Bitcoin does, but it is run as an open-source software project, meaning the software code is freely available for anyone to work on. Still another, the Hyperledger Project, recently received 44,000 lines of code from IBM, which is sharing some of its software with developers who are trying to create distributed ledgers. IBM also plans to deploy distributed ledgers internally in what would be a significant test, considering that the company does $45 billion in global financing each year. There is even the ledger system Bigchain DB that is posited as a way to prevent blood diamonds — those sold to finance armed conflicts — from entering the international gems trade. (A distributed ledger can be set up to identify every actor and what they do.) Ripple’s technology is similar to the Bitcoin system, but with some differences that make it easy to manage a far larger number of transactions at the same time. Following Bitcoin’s lead, Mr. Larsen also worked on developing his own currency, called XRP. But he later decided to incorporate XRP into his ledger technology as a way to improve the existing international system, instead of overwhelming it with a new cryptocurrency. He appears to have decided he will have more success by working with authorities on the existing problems of global transactions than on a new currency like Bitcoin, whose fans favor major disruption. “A lot of financial technology is foolhardy,” Mr. Larsen said. “Saying, ‘We’re going to kill banks. We’re going to disrupt everything,’ ignores some realities.” A San Francisco native, Mr. Larsen began his career conducting international audits for Chevron. He graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991. Five years later, he started E-Loan, one of the first online mortgage companies. He took it public, but left in 2005 to start Prosper Marketplace, a peer-to-peer lending operation that, after initial regulatory clashes over lending laws, has facilitated several billion dollars’ worth of loans. He left Prosper in 2012 to work on XRP and a global ledger system open to everyone trading anything that two people agreed was worth something — goats, money, labor, you name it. He started Ripple, originally Ripple Labs, in 2013. In 2015, it paid a $700,000 civil fine for selling XRP without registering with the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Then Mr. Larsen abandoned his Internet currency plans and turned toward the bigger transactional system. Perhaps in a sign that regulators agreed it was time to figure out how to move money in the networked world, Ripple was invited to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, where Mr. Larsen gave a presentation to central bankers from 40 countries. Even die-hard Bitcoin fans seem ready to accept the idea that the most promising approach to reforming financial transactions — at least for now — is to focus on the system, rather than on a currency. “What Chris and his team have done is to work within existing constraints,” said Barry Silbert, founder of the Digital Currency Group, which has made 67 investments in financial technology businesses. “Longer term, we’ll see if that can compete with an entirely new system.”",0.09619516129032257,0.06015110785272076

The Financial Conduct Authority, Britain’s top financial regulator, has granted an electronic money license to Circle, a company based in Boston that uses Bitcoin, the virtual currency, to enable consumers to make payments to other consumers using a mobile app, or “social payments” as the company puts it. The regulator helped Circle get the license by putting it in the government’s Innovation Hub, which is one of several initiatives Britain has undertaken to encourage experimentation in the financial industry. The license makes it possible for Circle to establish a banking relationship with Barclays, the British bank. It is the first time that a large global bank has agreed to work with a Bitcoin company, though Circle has attracted investments from others. The British economic secretary to the treasury, Harriett Baldwin, said in an email that the license and Barclays’ relationship with Circle “prove our decision to introduce the most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime is paying off and cements our status as the world’s fintech capital.” Circle, which was founded in 2013, already allows customers in the United States to easily send payments to one another and buy and sell Bitcoin, and customers in Britain will now be able to do the same. But Circle has long aimed to use Bitcoin as a back-end network to make it easier and cheaper to move money between national currencies. The Bitcoin technology, which first emerged in 2009, has been promoted as a way to quickly and cheaply move money across national borders without using traditional money-transmitting services such as Western Union. Circle is set up so that its customers can hold their money in national currencies to avoid the volatile price of Bitcoin. When a customer wants to move money, he or she can buy Bitcoin for the short period of time required to send the money or simply move dollars or pounds from a linked bank account. The British license will allow Circle customers to instantly transfer money between dollars and British pounds — and soon enough, between those currencies and euros, given that the e-money license is valid across the European Union. “For the first time any consumer in the U.S. and the U.K. will be able to beam sterling and dollars back and forth, instantly for free,” said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder of Circle. “That’s just never been possible.” It is a difficult moment for the virtual currency. The developers who maintain the basic Bitcoin software have been divided over updates to the software. That has caused a schism in the Bitcoin community and slowed down transactions. Some companies have been looking at other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum, as an alternative way to transfer money using what is known as a blockchain, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Mr. Allaire said that Ethereum was not yet ready for global use in the same way as Bitcoin, but that it could be in the future. “We are not wedded to one blockchain as the right one,” he said. In the United States, Circle has not managed to take Bitcoin mainstream, but it has gotten Bitcoin some key seals of approval. Back in 2013, it got funding from the major venture capital firms Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners. And last year, Circle became the first company to get a so-called BitLicense from New York state’s top financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services. The New York agency had been the only regulatory body to devise a licensing system for virtual currency companies, trying to confront the fraud and crime that have plagued the technology. But the British government has taken several steps to emphasize its interest in attracting virtual currency start-ups, among other types of financial technology, to London. The British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, publicly purchased virtual currency from a Bitcoin A.T.M. in 2014 at an event where he announced the government’s desire to work with virtual currency companies. The moves appear to be, at least in part, a way to draw new businesses to London as many parts of the financial industry have struggled with lagging revenue. Several executives at Barclays have previously discussed the bank’s interest in Bitcoin and the blockchain technology. The bank has labs in London dedicated to experimenting with the technology.",0.1537129032258065,0.04316500256016385

The men, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, chose targets with complex yet vulnerable systems — organizations that could afford to pay ransoms and needed to urgently restore their systems back online, prosecutors said. In the case of Atlanta, one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever launched against a major American city, the pair broke into the city’s computer systems and held their data hostage for about $51,000 worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, prosecutors said. “They deliberately engaged in an extreme form of 21st-century digital blackmail, attacking and extorting vulnerable victims like hospitals and schools, victims they knew would be willing and able to pay,” Brian Benczkowski, the head of the criminal division of the Justice Department, said in a news conference on Wednesday. The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on two other Iranians, accusing them of changing the Bitcoin obtained by the hackers into Iranian rial. Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri, who are wanted by the F.B.I., created the malicious software SamSam Ransomware, prosecutors said, and began to gain access to their victims’ computers in January 2016. The software is well known to cybersecurity experts. Atlanta officials said at the time that they would not pay the ransom, even as the attack ground court, parking and employment systems to a halt. For days, police officers wrote reports by hand, warrants were not validated, applications for city jobs sat unprocessed and government workers were unable to access basic administrative systems. “Victims are encouraged not to pay the ransom,” said Amy Hess, a top F.B.I. cybercrime official. She added that there is no guarantee that the victims will get their data back. Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri collected more than $6 million in extortion payments, law enforcement officials said. The cities and businesses targeted lost more than $30 million as they scrambled to fix computer systems and recovered data, according to court documents. Many of the victims were public agencies with missions that involve lifesaving and other critical functions. Among them were Allscripts Healthcare; Laboratory Corporation of America; the city of Newark; the University of Calgary; the Port of San Diego; the Colorado Department of Transportation; and hospitals and health care groups in Los Angeles, Kansas, Maryland and Nebraska. In the case of Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri, the Justice Department indictment indicated that they belonged to the SamSam group, which is well known to cybersecurity researchers. The group was also known for meticulously encrypting its victims’ data, manually from file to file; changing file names to “I’m sorry”; demanding high ransom payments in Bitcoin; and giving victims only a week to pay before they made their data permanently inaccessible, according to major security firms like Symantec, the Crypsis Group and others. Cybersecurity researchers said they were surprised to learn that the SamSam group was based in Iran. Other than the group’s name — Samsam Kandi is the name of a tiny Iranian village — no indicators showed that the group was based in Iran. “They weren’t using any of the Iranian infrastructure or typical Iranian tools and, until now, ransomware was not a typical Iranian attack method,” said Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm based in Boston. The defendants had used Bitcoin exchanges to launder their ransomware profits. People in countries with heavily sanctioned governments like North Korea and Iran are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions, Mr. Liska said. Though officials were careful to note that the suspects were not affiliated with the government of Iran, American officials and private-sector cybersecurity experts have been closely monitoring internet traffic out of Iran after President Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal over its nuclear program last May. Within 24 hours, monitors in the United States and Israel picked up a notable shift in Iranian state hacking activity, including renewed attacks on diplomats and foreign affairs offices of American allies, as well as employees at major telecommunication companies.",0.08620937499999999,0.029277343749999997

Ethereum, a rival to Bitcoin, has soared in value and climbed 1,000 percent over the last three months,
Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Ethereum’s rise has attracted attention from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM.   At the same time, Bitcoin has struggled as its community has been riven with divisions, which has slowed down transactions and driven businesses toward alternative currencies.  Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly, offering the possibility of money and assets being exchanged more quickly and cheaply. Ethereum has also won fans with additional promises to provide a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.   The capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to executives — many corporations have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, which could detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system, known as an Ether. The value of an Ether has soared as high as $12 from about $1 since the beginning of the year, bringing the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times.  The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, but it could yet face the same technical and legal problems that have affected Bitcoin.  Advocates for Bitcoin have argued that Ethereum will face more security problems because its software is more complex. It is also less tested and has faced fewer attacks than Bitcoin.  
 YAHOO AND THE BUYBACK MIRAGE  |  Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that it is buying back shares when it can be hazardous to its long-term financial health?
Gretchen Morgenson asks in Fair Game.  Not all repurchase programs are bad, but the harmful probably outnumber the beneficial. And buybacks make earnings look better on a per-share basis, but have no effect on overall profit growth.  The crucial flaw in buybacks is that they reward sellers of a company’s stock over its long-term holders, Ms. Morgenson writes. Yahoo bought back $6.6 billion of shares from 2008 to 2014, according to Robert L. Colby, a retired investment professional and developer of an equity valuation service. These purchases increased Yahoo’s earnings per share about 16 percent annually, on average, but growth in overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.  Mr. Colby estimates that if Yahoo had invested the same amount of money in its operations, it would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.
And the buybacks provided only a one-time benefit.  This analysis may be of interest to Starboard Value, which nominated directors to replace Yahoo’s entire board on Thursday.  Starboard’s move means only one thing, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor. The race is on to sell Yahoo.  But it is a silly situation. Yahoo’s directors are now trying to run an auction and reach a deal before they are thrown out. At the same time, Starboard is trying to unseat the board so it can cut the same deal. The groups are separated only by the fact that the hedge fund investors don’t trust the directors to cut a good deal.
Yahoo has had a trust issue for years, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. As a result, some are even gossiping about whether Yahoo is taking the sale process seriously.  Yahoo may be in a tricky situation with this hedge fund, but it is  hardly alone in buying back stock.  A group of institutional investors, the Shareholder Forum, will convene soon to examine the benefits of buybacks. “You really have to ask why a company’s board decides to return a big chunk of capital instead of replacing managers with ones who can figure out how to develop the operations,” said Gary Lutin, who oversees the forum. “If the board doesn’t think it’s worth investing in the company’s future, how can a shareholder justify continuing to hold the stock, or voting for directors who’ve given up?”

 LAW GRADUATE WHO SUED HER SCHOOL LOSES AT TRIAL  |  A jury in San Diego rejected claims by Anna Alaburda that the Thomas Jefferson School of Law enticed her to enroll by using misleading graduate employment figures,
Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook. Ms. Alaburda, 37, had argued that the school reported a higher percentage of its graduates landed jobs after graduation than was actually case and that her choice of school was based on bogus data.  She had amassed more than $150,000 in debt, but had been unable to find a full-time, salaried job as a lawyer.  A jury voted nine to three to reject her claims.  Thomas Jefferson stood by its employment figures, but argued that earning a law degree was not a guarantee of a well-paying job.  Other law school graduates have tried to hold law schools to account. About 15 such lawsuits were derailed before they reached the jury. Ms. Alaburda, who invoked California state fraud protections, was the first to get her case before a jury.  Entry-level legal jobs began to shrink after the 2008 economic slowdown, and the American Bar Association has been taking steps to require law schools to be more open about postgraduate job placement. But critics said the jury’s decision let schools off the hook.  Brian A. Procel, Ms. Alaburda’s lawyer, said the school did not reveal that its employment figures included such work as pool cleaner, waitress or sales clerk, and that they were based on a small sample of graduates.  Thomas Jefferson employees said they did not understand the importance of the employment data and that the school was a nonprofit institution offering opportunities to students who might not have other options to attend law school.  Mr. Procel said these assertions were contradicted by correspondence indicating that law school employees knew that the employment figures affected the law school’s national ranking.      |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Dell to Sell I.T.

Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency — known as Ethereum — has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months. Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0. The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin software should develop. The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter Ethereum. Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen. But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts. The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes. All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. “Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution — the most elegant solution we have seen to date,” said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft’s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together — somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system — known as an Ether — that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, “Blockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting Through the Hype.” Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress’s investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a “significant” purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry’s chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. “A lot of the more established players were thinking, ‘It’s still an experiment,’ ” he said. “It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.” Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain — the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source — say, The Associated Press — the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin’s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software’s development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers — or nodes — helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin’s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. “Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,” he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. “Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,” Mr. Bonneau said. “It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.”",0.17528787878787883,0.1136227480432026

McClendon, an Oklahoma wildcatter, with conspiring to suppress the prices paid for oil and natural gas leases,  Clifford Krauss reports in The New York Times. Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012.  The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company.  “His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,” said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division.  In a statement, Mr. McClendon denied all charges and argued that he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahoma’s economy while providing energy for the country.  “The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,” he said.  Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country.  With him at the helm, Chesapeake and a handful of other companies helped turn the United States into an energy exporter  and pioneered hydraulic fracturing in newly explored shale fields. They ended up producing a glut of natural gas that sent them to the brink of bankruptcy as gas prices collapsed.  Chesapeake’s stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells.  Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter. 
 TENURE VOTING COULD SHIFT POWER BALANCE  |  It is time to consider “tenure voting,” a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock,
Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. Dual-class stock is all the rage — some 13.5 percent of initial public offerings included some type of dual-class structure, according to Dealogic.  This creates a culture of “haves” and “have-nots,” where a vote is worth everything or nothing. The founders control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity.  The idea can work well in principle, allowing the founders to look to the long term. And when one share counts for one vote, too often the vote doesn’t count.  But neither model reflects an increasingly complicated reality.  In tenure voting, more votes are awarded for a longer holding period with the intention of empowering shareholders who stick with the company. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but long-term institutional investors would grow over time, allowing some measured shareholder activism.  There are indications that shareholders value the power to vote too. Google’s “no vote” shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares. 
 SABMILLER SELLS STAKE IN TOP BEER  |  A state-backed brewer agreed to buy out SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow, the world’s best-selling beer,

Anheuser-Busch InBev is hoping the sale to China Resources Beer will help ease regulators’ concerns about its nearly $104 billion merger with SABMiller. The deal values SABMiller’s stake at about $1.6 billion and is one of several transactions being undertaken in order to appease regulators.  SABMiller agreed to sell its stake in MillerCoors in the United States for about $12 billion in November. Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller’s European operations, for about $2.8 billion.  All these transactions are contingent on SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch Inbev completing their merger.

 EVEN TRADERS ARE CONFUSED BY STOCK EXCHANGE PRICES  |  Computer-driven American stock markets have become so complex that at any moment in time more than 800 different pricing possibilities are being offered to trading firms across 12 official exchanges, according to a report by the Royal Bank of Canada,
Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook.  The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices.  RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand.  Some big mutual fund companies said that before seeing the research even they had not realized how convoluted the system had become.  At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the “Investor Tier,” the “Ultra Tier,” the “Mega-Step-Up Tier 1” and the “Mega-Step-Up Tier 2,” among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock.  Because of the hundreds of pricing structures, the brokers actually buying and selling stocks can be given incentives to make decisions that are not in the best interest of clients. The opaque pricing structures can make it nearly impossible for investors and even brokers to determine what they will pay for a given trade. The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange.  The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book “Flash Boys” and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks. One tool they are proposing is a speed bump to slow down trading.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Hachette Reaches New Deal With Perseus Books  |  Hachette, which sought to buy Perseus Books in a 2014 deal that collapsed, announced that it would buy Perseus’s publishing arm.NYT »

Shares in Europe and Asia surged on Monday amid speculation that the sell-off had gone too far, as Bloomberg News reports. European stocks rose 2.9 percent on Monday, having slid nearly 10 percent over two weeks.  After a weeklong holiday, mainland China shares rose to three-week highs on Tuesday. The Nikkei edged up 0.9 percent after a 7.2 percent climb on Monday.  Oil prices also rose ahead of a meeting between officials from Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers. Oil pared its gains later when Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said it would fix production at January levels, as Bloomberg News reports.  Nervousness about banks seemed to abate somewhat on Monday as the sector helped European stocks close higher on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reports. HSBC, which announced on Sunday that it would keep its headquarters in Britain, rose about 4.6 percent in Hong Kong on Monday and continued to edge up on Tuesday.  HSBC said that Asia remained “at the heart of the group’s strategy,” but that keeping its headquarters in London was better for customers and shareholders, Chad Bray reports in DealBook. 
 HEDGE FUNDS BACK IN THE GAME  |  Markets have been roiled and hedge funds have just come off their worst year since the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, but some big-name hedge fund managers are still hauling in money,
Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook. Adam Sender, a well-known collector of contemporary art who closed his hedge fund two years ago, is back in the game. Scott Bessent recently left George Soros’s family office to start a $4.5 billion firm called Key Square Group. Eric Cole, a former trader for David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, raised $1 billion for his new firm, Warlander Asset Management.  Anil Prasad, a former Citigroup foreign exchange trader, raised nearly $300 million with a co-founder for Silver Ridge Asset Management. Even John Paulson, who posted losses in several portfolios in 2015, has raised $600 million for a new distressed fund.  Managers who have waited for years as stock hit one new high after another, now sense an opportunity in the market turbulence — a chance to make bold bets on volatility in stocks, bonds and commodities. For traders, a “dislocation means there is a lot of stuff to buy,” said Putri Pascualy, a managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management.

 A RECIPE FOR TOXIC AIR IN PUERTO RICO   |  A committee of the Puerto Rico Senate has been pulling back the curtain on the mysterious Fuel Procurement Office, raising the question of whether the island’s power authority bought dirty oil while billing customers for clean oil,
Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook.  Abraham Ortiz, a lab director at the Puerto Rico power authority, said the authority bought cheap, residual oil that failed to meet federal clean-air standards and faked tests to make it look as if it had passed. He said ledgers were falsified to make it seem as if the authority had bought higher-grade oil and the higher price was passed on to consumers.   Mr. Ortiz is not the only one to have made this claim, but Arturo Díaz-Angueira, a lawyer for the power authority, said the Senate investigation was politically motivated. He added that the timing of the hearings, just as the power authority was in talks with its creditors to restructure its $9 billion debt, was also particularly troubling.  If the accusations were true, they would amount to a decades-long fraud.  Eduardo Bhatia, the Senate president who is overseeing the hearings, said the power authority’s longstanding mission had been to bring development and prosperity on the island. Instead it had become an anchor, pulling Puerto Rico down.     |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Vodafone and Liberty to Combine Dutch Businesses  |  Vodafone and Liberty Global have agreed to combine their Dutch businesses to form a mobile-and-cable operator worth 19 billion euros, or about $21 billion. the financial times

92,Morning Agenda: Fears Over Central Bank Moves,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/morning-agenda-fears-over-central-bank-moves/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-02-12T10:46:33+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"FEARS OVER CENTRAL BANK MOVES  |  The decision by the Swedish central bank to lower its short-term rate to minus 0.50 percent from minus 0.35 percent has heightened fears that the brazen action by central banks is making things worse for the global economy,
Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook. Markets generally embrace conviction and run away from uncertainty, but after the decision by the central bank, the Riksbank, stock markets sank, the price of oil plunged and investors fled for haven assets.  The selloff continued in Asia on Friday. Japanese stocks sank to their lowest level in more than a year, Jonathan Soble reports in The New York Times. In South Korea, trading on the technology-heavy Kosdaq Index was suspended for 20 minutes after the benchmark fell by as much as 8.2 percent, The Wall Street Journal reports.  To investors, the rate cut smacked of desperation and it indicated that global central bankers are moving toward a round of competitive devaluations, or currency wars, to stimulate their economies.  Some suspect that efforts to keep currencies weak and exports strong could be counterproductive since someone still needs to buy all those goods. Negative interests also cut into bank profits and make savers more fearful and less likely to spend. All of which can lead to a global recession. The Federal Reserve is still maintaining that it expects the domestic economy to keep chugging along, but investors, still fearful of a global downturn, are betting that it will not move before 2017, as Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times.  “We will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had,” Janet L. Yellen told Congress on Thursday. “Today I think it’s premature to render a judgment.” Ms. Yellen also emphasized that she did not foresee a need for negative rates.   
 DOUBTS SWIRL AROUND EUROPEAN BANKS  |  It’s not just central bankers feeling the heat from financial markets. Investors are questioning whether Deutsche Bank waited too long to mend itself and its shares have plunged nearly 40 percent so far this year,  Peter Eavis and Jack Ewing report in DealBook. Deutsche, Germany’s largest bank, is now worth about a third of its liquidation value. This suggests that investors have little faith in the ability of John Cryan, the co-chief executive, to squeeze solid earnings from its business.   Investors in credit markets have even begun to bet that some of Deutsche Bank’s bonds will not be repaid in full.  Doubts are swirling around many of Europe’s largest banks, which were slower than their United States counterparts to bolster their balance sheets after the financial crisis. European banks with large trading operations, like Credit Suisse and Société Générale, have come into investors’ crosshairs this week. Shares in JPMorgan have also fallen sharply, but its chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, may be hoping that he can shore up confidence by buying stock himself.   Mr. Dimon spent $26 million of his personal fortune buying 500,000 shares, Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. The move also recognizes that the shares have become relatively cheap.

 ACTIVISTS TO GET SEATS ON A.I.G. BOARD  |  American International Group has not given Carl C. Icahn and John Paulson the breakup that they have pushed for, but it has given them seats at the table,
Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. They will gain two seats on the A.I.G. board, although Mr. Icahn said that he would appoint an associate of his investment firm because he is occupied with several other companies.  Rather than end the debate, the move is likely to just move the battle into the boardroom.  A.I.G. said Mr. Icahn and Mr. Paulson had agreed not to carry out a proxy fight, but it also did not back down from the less radical strategic plan it announced last month. They had lobbied to split up A.I.G. so that it could avoid the “systemically important financial institution” designation that brings extra regulatory scrutiny and costs.  “We continue to believe the smaller and simpler is better and look forward to working collaboratively with the board and management to help catalyze a turnaround,” Mr. Icahn said in a news release on Thursday.      |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Pandora Is Said to Have Held Talks About Selling Itself  |  Pandora, whose stock has fallen more than 60 percent since October, is said to be working with Morgan Stanley to meet with potential buyers.NYT »

The start-up Digital Asset Holdings, based in New York, said on Thursday afternoon that it had raised the money from 13 financial institutions, including Ms. Masters’s former employer, JPMorgan, as well as Citi, BNP Paribas and Santander.  At the same time, the company also announced that it had signed a deal with Australia’s primary stock exchange, ASX, to provide technology that would speed up the settlement and transfer of money after stock trades. ASX Limited is also making a big investment in Digital Asset Holdings.  Digital Asset Holdings has based its technology on the blockchain concept that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin. The blockchain is the database in which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike typical databases, the blockchain is maintained by users in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster — and more reliable — alternative to existing transaction systems.  Many financial institutions have been looking at ways to use a blockchain to modernize financial transactions by cutting out various middlemen from the markets. The Nasdaq stock exchange has already integrated blockchain technology to improve stock trading.  Ms. Masters gave the technology a big boost when she announced her involvement with Digital Asset Holdings in early 2015. She left JPMorgan the previous year after a career during which she became one of the best-known figures in the financial industry.  Big questions remain, however, about how blockchain technology can be used in the real world, and so far talk of its potential has raced ahead of real-world uses.  In recent months, this disparity has caused some concern about the companies that are trying to raise money to build start-ups on the blockchain concept, including Digital Asset Holdings.  Potential investors said that it took Ms. Masters longer than expected to pull together her funders — and that some big-name banks ultimately declined to participate. But Ms. Masters ended up raising more money than the $35 million that had been previously discussed. This round of fund-raising values Digital Asset Holdings at $100 million. The Australian exchange company said that Digital Asset Holdings would help it develop new technology for the processes that take place after a stock is actually traded.  “Distributed Ledger Technology could provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce cost, time and complexity in the post-trade environment of Australia’s equity market,” the chief executive of ASX, Elmer Funke Kupper, said in a statement.  The other investors include CME Ventures, ABN AMRO, Santander’s innovation arm, Deutsche Börse Group, Accenture, Broadridge Financial Solutions, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, and PNC Financial Services.

94,Morning Agenda: Morgan Stanley Heeds Investors,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/morning-agenda-morgan-stanley-heeds-investors/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-01-15T11:05:25+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"MORGAN STANLEY HEEDS INVESTORS  |  All eyes will be on James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, on Tuesday, when the bank announces its 2015 financial results,
Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook. After holding off on an overhaul, Mr. Gorman last month began to make the cuts that investors were pushing for. Its bond and commodity trading desks were the most problematic businesses and he announced plans to lay off about a quarter of the staff at the division, known as fixed income. There was also a shake-up in the fixed-income division’s management ranks. But investors already wonder whether the changes have come too late. Morgan’s Stanley’s stock has fallen more than its largest competitors’ since news of the cuts starting circulating. Mr. Gorman has been credited with steadying many parts of the company and leading a push into the more stable earnings of wealth management. But the stock price is lower than it was when he took over in January 2010. Wall Street is facing challenges from new regulations that have raised the cost of buying, selling and holding bonds, commodities, derivatives and currencies. Morgan Stanley is under particular pressure because Mr. Gorman has already been through four leadership teams in the fixed-income division. Returns from the company as a whole are below the amount that the bank is presumed to pay its shareholders for their money: 10 percent. If it were not for the fixed-income business, returns would be comfortably above that. The bond-trading business, however, increases the level of equity and capital that the bank has to maintain. People briefed on the firm’s thinking said that Mr. Gorman did not move sooner partly because he did not anticipate the Federal Reserve’s continuing efforts to increase capital requirements for large banks.   FOURSQUARE RAISES $45 MILLION AND CUTS ITS VALUATION   |  Foursquare was ahead of the pack by creating a social app that used location technology, and now it is at the front of the wave of tech start-ups raising money at lower valuations,
Mike Isaac reports in DealBook. Foursquare said on Thursday that it had raised $45 million in new venture funding. The latest round of fund-raising valued the company at about half of the roughly $650 million that it was valued at in 2013, said people with knowledge of the terms of the deal. Foursquare is likely to be joined by other start-ups doing what are known as “down rounds,” accepting funding at lower values, with fears that some tech start-ups were ahead of themselves with their soaring valuations. Recode and TechCrunch had earlier reported that Foursquare was raising a down round. Foursquare’s plunge in valuation also reflects how the buzz around the company has faded, something acknowledged by Dennis Crowley, the founder and chief executive, who is stepping down to be executive chairman. “Everyone thought we were going to be the company that toppled Facebook, which is crazy talk,” Mr. Crowley said. Jeff Glueck, the chief operating officer who is being promoted to chief executive, added: “To raise $45 million in this environment, and on very employee-friendly terms, is a testament to the real business we have.”  GOLDMAN TO PAY UP TO $5 BILLION TO SETTLE FAULTY MORTGAGE CLAIMS  |  Goldman is again paying the price for its role in the financial crisis, seven years after the worst of it,
Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. The Wall Street firm said it had agreed to a civil settlement of up to $5 billion with federal prosecutors and regulators to resolve claims stemming from the marketing and selling of faulty mortgage securities to investors. Goldman, which reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said the settlement would reduce earnings in that period by about $1.5 billion on an after-tax basis.  It had attracted criticism for making money by betting against the housing market in the run-up to the crisis. But its role in churning out faulty mortgages and securities backed by home loans to borrowers who could not afford them was smaller than that of other Wall Street firms, so its settlement is smaller than the sums paid by Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.  The agreement requires Goldman to pay $2.385 billion in civil penalties and $875 million in cash, and provide up to $1.8 billion in relief to consumers. The settlement comes after the $3 billion that Goldman paid to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 to settle claims over the sale of flawed mortgage securities. It also paid $550 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in putting together a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus.

TO SELL APPLIANCES UNIT  |  General Electric has agreed to sell its appliances business to Qingdao Haier of China for $5.4 billion in cash, Amie Tsang reports in DealBook. The Chinese appliances company, which had revenues of about $32.6 billion in 2014, snapped up the appliances unit after a G.E. deal with Electrolux of Sweden worth $3.3 billion fell apart last year. G.E. has tried to sell the unit twice before as part of its efforts to focus on its core industrial businesses.  “G.E. Appliances is performing well and there was significant interest from potential buyers, helping drive a good deal which will benefit our investors, customers and employees,” Jeff Immelt, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “Haier has a stated focus to grow in the U.S., build their manufacturing presence here, and to invest further in the business,” Mr. Immelt added. G.E. said the deal valued the appliances unit at 10 times the past 12 months’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The appliances division had revenue of about $5.9 billion in 2014 and employs 12,000 people.

95,A Bitcoin Believer’s Crisis of Faith,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/business/dealbook/the-bitcoin-believer-who-gave-up.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2016-01-14T20:33:50+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Mike Hearn, a British computer programmer, holed up in his two-bedroom apartment in Zurich over several days and nights last week, writing a cri de coeur. Two years ago, Mr. Hearn quit a cushy programming job at Google’s Swiss headquarters to devote himself full time to what was his great passion: the virtual currency Bitcoin. He was one of a handful of developers around the world dedicated to maintaining the basic software that governs both the creation of new Bitcoins and the network on which the financial transactions take place. But a nasty fight has torn apart the small brotherhood of Bitcoin developers and raised questions about the survival of the virtual currency. Mr. Hearn, until recently one of the most prominent leaders of the Bitcoin project, became so disillusioned that in December he sold the few hundred Bitcoins he had left and quietly took a job at a new start-up. The impassioned blog post he was working on last week was an announcement that he was leaving Bitcoin behind entirely: “Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners.” The dispute — which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle — may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin’s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies. The divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn’s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats. These internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency — including many instances of theft and fraud — the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts. Part of the basic appeal of Bitcoin has been its promise to provide a more reliable and trustworthy alternative to existing currencies and financial networks. Unlike the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, institutions that are managed by humans, Bitcoin was supposed to rest on the infallible logic of math and computer code. In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians. The current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software — like all computer code — is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals. There may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software — and the virtual currency itself — in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn’s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins. Gavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn’s and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week. Some of Mr. Hearn’s allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network’s capacity while also introducing new standards of governance. But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place. “It never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,” Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. “It’s really shaken my faith in humanity.” Mr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world. At the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he’d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known. “So many questions,” Mr. Hearn wrote. “But it’s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.” Like many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling. Satoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn’t like, they didn’t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy — a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws. It took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project. Mr. Hearn joined a small but growing group of volunteers who worked on the basic Bitcoin software from various corners of the globe — the most committed of whom became known as the core developers. They met in person only a handful of times, but they would chat constantly online and send emails discussing potential changes. The leader of this effort, after Satoshi bowed out in 2011 (without ever revealing a real identity), was Mr. Andresen, a genial father of two from central Massachusetts who kept everyone on the same page. Mr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes — as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left. Mr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up. When tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises. The bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions. The problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through. When Mr. Hearn began pushing for changes to the core Bitcoin software to allow for larger blocks of transaction data, he faced immediate resistance. Gregory Maxwell, a largely self-taught programmer who had worked on Wikipedia and the Mozilla web browser, both open-source projects, said that larger blocks of transaction data would be harder for ordinary computers to process. The result, Mr. Maxwell warned, would be to hand control over the network to big companies that could afford powerful computers. For Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority. “It’s far from clear to me that the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old,” he wrote to other developers. Mr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn’t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin’s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second. The debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell’s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important. After leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley. As the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart. In the past, the leader of the Bitcoin software project, Mr. Andresen (no relation to Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), would have stepped in to mediate. Mr. Andresen says that as “lead maintainer” he always sought consensus, but on the few occasions when there was irresolvable disagreement, he made the final call, acting as a sort of “benevolent dictator.” But Mr. Andresen stepped back from his day-to-day role in 2014 and gave the job of lead maintainer to another volunteer on the project, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Dutch programmer, who said he did not intend to follow Mr. Andresen’s lead. “I cannot be the decider for network-level issues,” Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. “No one ‘owns’ Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it’s some kind of company.” Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software — largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions — which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system’s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land — what is known in open-source terminology as a fork. Forks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins. “So this is it. Here we are. The community is divided, and Bitcoin is forking,” Mr. Hearn wrote on Aug. 15, announcing the new software. The release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts — not by populist campaigns. In an interview with Vice a few days after the announcement, Mr. Maxwell compared the Bitcoin XT team to a “guy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat.” One of Mr. Maxwell’s confidants likened it to an attempted coup. Their supporters blocked Mr. Hearn’s announcement of Bitcoin XT — and any discussion of it — from the Bitcoin.org website and several other online forums where Bitcoin members met to discuss the project. The fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it. The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone “payed me for killing XT” — though he declined to say who was responsible. In the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell’s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network’s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn’t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position. “It’s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,” he said in an interview last week. Mr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn’s camp — saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor. Mr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making. Mr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed. Despite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system. This work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, “I want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.”",0.05284166666666666,0.029472711894586896
96,Start-Up With Bitcoin in Its DNA Stumbles on Fund-Raising Trail,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/business/dealbook/cash-call-for-a-new-technology.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-29T01:35:34+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The newest venture from Blythe Masters, until recently a star banker at JPMorgan Chase, appeared to be an overnight success story in the making. Her start-up, Digital Asset Holdings, is working in one of the hottest areas of growth on Wall Street today: the blockchain technology that underlies the virtual currency Bitcoin. And Ms. Masters has already received a promise from JPMorgan, her former employer, to be the lead investor on the new project, pitching in around $7.5 million. But Ms. Masters’s company has been struggling for months to close the deal with other investors. Most recently, large banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have balked at putting money into Digital Asset Holdings after learning that JPMorgan was being given better terms than other investors, according to several people briefed on the deal. The banks and financial firms looking into investing, the people said, have also expressed doubts about the actual software solutions Ms. Masters’s start-up is working on, much of which has been put together through purchases of smaller start-ups. “The deal would need to improve materially for us to get involved,” said one executive at a financial firm, who has been looking at putting money into Ms. Masters’s company, speaking on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. “It’s not supercompelling.” Digital Asset Holdings’ head of business development, Beth Shah, said assertions that the company was facing challenges in raising funds were inaccurate but she declined to provide further details. All of the potential investors declined to comment. The challenges that Ms. Masters is facing reflect in part the increasingly difficult environment facing start-ups of all sorts as investors have begun to worry that the tech industry has been overhyped and overvalued, pushing down values for companies both public and private. She is also contending with the difficulty of building a viable business around the virtual currency Bitcoin and the various technological concepts it has introduced to the financial industry, most of all the blockchain. The blockchain is the database on which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike normal databases, the blockchain is maintained by everyone using the database in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster — and more reliable — alternative to existing transaction systems. Digital Asset Holdings is proposing to build something similar to the blockchain database, in order to provide a cheaper and faster way to trade other sorts of financial assets, such as loans and foreign currencies. The problem for Ms. Masters is that several other start-ups are trying to do something similar, and there is no guarantee that any of the start-ups will ultimately succeed. Many industry experts think that it could take years to get to the point where the blockchain technology can be used effectively by banks — if it works at all. The New York-based start-up ItBit, which is building its own blockchain-like technology, had been out trying to raise $100 million based on the assumption that the company was worth $250 million. More recently, it has scaled that back and is now hoping to get $50 million from investors, with a valuation of $135 million. Ms. Masters hopes to raise from $35 million to $45 million, valuing the company at $100 million. Digital Asset Holdings is a relative newcomer to the area. It grew out of a Bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, which operated through a little-known subsidiary of DRW known as Cumberland Mining & Materials. The founder of DRW, Don Wilson, helped recruit Ms. Masters, 46, to Digital Asset Holdings this year. Ms. Masters, Oxford-born and Cambridge-educated, had worked at JPMorgan for nearly three decades. She became one of the bank’s better-known employees after helping to develop the credit default swap in the 1990s. But Ms. Masters left JPMorgan in 2014 after a unit in the commodities business she headed was accused of manipulating electricity prices. Ms. Masters was not accused of wrongdoing, and the bank has said that her departure was not tied to the regulatory problems. Soon after Ms. Masters joined Digital Asset Holdings, known as D.A., this past spring, the company began working with the investment bank Sandler O’Neill to raise money. Within the company, there was an expectation that the fund-raising would be finished by the fall, according to people briefed on the situation. At the same time, though, D.A. was trying to figure out its product. Initially, it was looking at creating financial services tied to Bitcoin itself, including a sliver of a Bitcoin that would maintain the value of a dollar. On the wall of the offices there was a screen showing the price of the virtual currency, according to people who were at the offices. But not long after Ms. Masters arrived, the Bitcoin chart came down and Digital Asset Holdings began to talk about developing databases similar to the one that Bitcoin had introduced, but not connected to Bitcoin itself. Ms. Masters secured most of the company’s top programming talent by buying smaller start-ups already working in that area, firms with names like Hyperledger, Blockstack and Bits of Proof. In recent months, the software that Ms. Masters has shown to potential investors allows for the issuance and trading of so-called syndicated loans — large loans broken into pieces and sold to different investors. It can take weeks for trades in this market to go through, a time span that D.A. is trying to shorten. Investors who have looked at the software, though, say they are not convinced that Ms. Masters’s technology will fix the problems in the loan market, which are attributed as much to human cooperation as to bad software. There are also indications that Digital Asset Holdings has not had an easy time integrating all the outside technology start-ups it bought. For example, two of the three employees who worked at Blockstack, which the company acquired in October, have already negotiated to leave D.A., people briefed on the situation said. “All employees who were offered permanent positions at the time of the acquisitions of Bits of Proof, Hyperledger and Blockstack are still with the company,” said Ms. Shah. One of Ms. Masters’s competitors, known as R3, has approached the problem from a different angle and is trying to determine how the banks want to use the blockchain before building specific software. With that strategy, R3 has signed on over 40 banks as partners in recent months, including all of the big banks that Ms. Masters is trying to persuade to invest in her company. None of this has scared off JPMorgan, which has agreed to lead the Series A investment round in Digital Asset Holdings, people briefed on the negotiations said. To reward JPMorgan, the people said, D.A. plans to grant it warrants to buy a bigger share of the start-up in the future at the same price it is getting now. JPMorgan is said to have committed to helping Ms. Masters’s company improve and secure adoption of its technology. Some of the other banks looking into investing in D.A. raised concerns about the JPMorgan deal in a meeting this month at the Sandler O’Neill offices that included Citi, Goldman and Bank of America representatives. Smaller financial companies, like Nasdaq and Markit, have also remained on the fence, the people briefed on the negotiations said.",0.10317746478873241,0.02471186546890772
97,Morning Agenda:  Janet Yellen’s New Risk Manager Role,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/morning-agenda-janet-yellens-new-risk-manager-role/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-17T11:00:44+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"JANET YELLEN’S NEW RISK MANAGER ROLE  |  The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the first time in almost a decade yesterday, a move that was both widely anticipated yet closely scrutinized, Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times. Rates were raised to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent. Fed officials emphasized that they intended to raise rates gradually, about one percentage point a year for the next three years.  “The economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not complete,” the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said at a news conference. She added that the decision was a sign of how much the economy had improved.  Financial markets took the news calmly, as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.5 percent and the yield on two-year Treasuries closed above 1 percent for the first time since April 2010. European and Asian markets also rose after the decision, as The Wall Street Journal reports. Investors still debated whether a rate increase could create more turbulence, Peter Eavis reports in DealBook. A broad pullback on Wall Street could restrict the flow of credit into the economy and a decline in stocks could damage the financial standing of households.  The Fed watches for signs of such disruption and Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the central bank would take that into account. As Neil Irwin notes in The Upshot, Ms. Yellen has just stepped into her new role of risk manager.  If the struggling global economy holds back the United States more than expected and inflation continues to lag, the Fed may have to reverse course. But, as Ms. Yellen discussed on Wednesday, she also had to avoid pushing rates up sharply when the economy was at real risk of overheating and creating even more disruption.
Fed officials hope that a gradual tightening now will make miscalibrations less likely. Ms. Yellen will also have to conduct some risk management in the background. She cannot make decisions unilaterally so she will have to keep her colleagues on board with her policies.  The Fed would also want to avoid making a major policy pivot in the heat of a presidential campaign. The hope was that they would not have to make any major moves just when an action could become a political football. 
 THIRD AVENUE REACHES DEAL WITH S.E.C.  |  Third Avenue Management reached an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that makes official its bar on investors taking their money out of a stricken bond fund,
Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook. The fund’s portfolio is made up of hard-to-sell corporate bonds either in bankruptcy or emerging from it, which makes it impossible to meet mounting redemption demands.  Under the agreement, the remaining assets will be transferred from a liquidating trust back into the original mutual fund structure. Remaining investors can track the fund’s value on a daily basis. The return of investor assets could still take a year or more.  The after-the-fact agreement showed how fast events have moved. The fund felt that it did not have the time to wait for official approval before the shutdown, people briefed on the discussions said.  Bond funds with similar investment strategies have also experienced a fall in their net assets, but there has not been a broader panic. Analysts have noted that Third Avenue’s credit fund was an outlier because it had a much higher proportion of assets in private equity-like investments, which cannot be readily converted into cash. 
 ON THE AGENDA  |  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will release its latest manufacturing business outlook survey at 8:30 a.m. Data on weekly unemployment insurance claims will be released at 8:30 a.m. General Mills will hold a conference call to discuss its second-quarter earnings at 8:30 a.m.  
 ARGENTINA SET TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY  |  Mauricio Macri, Argentina’s new president, has rushed to bring in sweeping market-oriented changes intended to revive the ailing economy. As part of that, the finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, scrapped currency controls, a move that is expected to lead to a plunge in the peso,  Jonathan Gilbert reports in The New York Times. “Lifting these barriers that have halted the economy for many years will kick it along the path to growth,” Mr. Prat-Gay told reporters.  Although the move is intended to help bolster the economy, a devaluation is likely to lead to hardship for many Argentines as prices shoot up. Economists have long warned that the overvalued peso, which was tightly administered by the central bank under Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, made the nation uncompetitive and thwarted foreign investment.  Mrs. Kirchner, who had seen the gains of devaluation undermined by inflation, left another devaluation to her successor because the political cost was too high, said Gastón Rossi, a former deputy economy minister and director of a consultancy in Buenos Aires. Economists expect Mr. Macri’s changes to end in a recession or anemic growth next year, followed by a rebound in 2017.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  AstraZeneca to Acquire Majority Stake in Acerta Pharma  |  The deal would be the latest by a pharmaceutical company in what has been a record year for mergers, driven in part by transactions in the health care sector.NYT »

98,5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Prices Are Plunging Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/cryptocurrency-price-drop.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-11-21,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The news on Wall Street this week has been bleak: sharp declines, fears of a bear market and high-flying technology stocks that suddenly took a tumble. Traditional stock investors may be taking a beating, but they should be glad they didn’t put their money in cryptocurrencies. As of Wednesday, the price of a Bitcoin had fallen about 25 percent in a week and was down more than 75 percent from its peak in December. Other digital tokens have fallen even more sharply in value. The latest declines are occurring almost a year after cryptocurrency markets, fueled by a rush of new, wealthy investors, went into overdrive. There are several factors behind the collapse in prices, with many of them the flip side of what drew people to cryptocurrencies in the first place. Relying on unregulated infrastructure and exchanges is risky. Most cryptocurrency trading happens outside the United States on exchanges with little or no regulatory oversight. That allowed investors to pile in with abandon, but the inherent dangers have long been clear. This year, researchers at the University of Texas published evidence suggesting that one of the largest exchanges, Bitfinex, had helped create a proprietary cryptocurrency, Tether, that was used to artificially pump up the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the Justice Department was conducting a criminal investigation of price manipulation using Tether, one of many issues related to Tether that are scaring investors away. Every unit of Tether is supposed to be backed by a dollar in a bank, but managers of Bitfinex and Tether have struggled to show that they even have bank accounts. Many traders have been selling Tether at a loss just so they can take their money out. The activities of another large exchange, OKEx, have also led traders to question whether they can trust the institutions at the center of the cryptocurrency industry. OKEx, which began in China, altered some trading rules without advance notice, according to a large hedge fund, Amber AI, which published a post on Medium about the changes. AmberAI said customers appeared to have lost millions of dollars because of the changes. OKEx, without acknowledging the losses, apologized to customers for some of the changes, which it said had been made to cope with chaotic trading. Regulators are cracking down.  Much of the excitement surrounding the cryptocurrency markets last year was stirred up by companies that raised money selling custom cryptocurrencies in so-called initial coin offerings, which let start-ups raise money without going through regulators. At the time, lawyers warned that these offerings would probably run afoul of securities rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently stepped up punishment of companies that violated securities law with their offerings. In the most chilling case, the commission punished two companies on Friday for their initial coin offerings, forcing them to return money to investors while saying the cases would be templates for future actions. Cryptocurrencies are managed by communities of developers. That can get messy. The Bitcoin network was created with so-called open-source software released to the world in January 2009. For many years, members of the Bitcoin community worked together to improve the software. That collegiality has faded. Last year, after a bitter fight, one group released a new version of Bitcoin software with slightly different rules that gave rise to a new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash. The people backing Bitcoin Cash subsequently had their own disagreements. This week, they splintered into two groups. In the software world, it’s known as a fork: Bitcoin Cash was split into two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. The new forks have not altered the original Bitcoin. But they have created chaos in the trading markets, as exchanges struggle to define which coin customers are trading. The battles have also raised questions about one of the fundamental attractions of cryptocurrencies: their apparent scarcity. The creator of Bitcoin said only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. But how scarce do those 21 million Bitcoins seem if there are also 21 million tokens of each new copycat? As Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at the trading firm ThinkMarkets, put it in a note to clients this week: “Forking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether.” Cryptocurrencies were going to solve all kinds of real-world problems. But the real world hasn’t had much use for cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin was supposed to make it easier to send payments instantly over international borders. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network until recently, was going to create a kind of global super computer. Thousands of other tokens were also designed to be used for high-minded purposes. But so far, about the only thing the tokens have been used for is speculative trading. Developers have complained that Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other networks are hobbled by technical problems that make their tokens hard to use in real-world transactions. Those working on the cryptocurrencies have promised solutions, but they have been slow to produce them. Governments could get into cryptocurrencies, and do a better job of managing them.  One hopeful sign for digital tokens came from Christine Lagarde, the leader of the International Monetary Fund. In a speech last week, she made a case for why countries and central banks might want to issue digital currencies similar to Bitcoin. (Some countries are already experimenting with this.) But Ms. Lagarde added a note of caution. While saying cryptocurrencies could improve on current payment networks, she also said governments could manage them more effectively and eliminate the issues of trust that have hobbled them. The remarks could have a chilling effect on existing, nongovernmental tokens.",-0.027801999999999997,0.05057748917748918
99,Morning Agenda: All Eyes on the Federal Reserve,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/morning-agenda-all-eyes-on-the-federal-reserve/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-16T10:47:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"ALL EYES ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE  |  If the Federal Reserve decides to raise its benchmark interest rate today, as expected, it will bring an end to seven years of low interest rates. The decision will come as no surprise. The bigger surprise would be if the Fed stayed pat. Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has long telegraphed what indicators the central bank has been keeping its eye on and statements from Fed officials have emphasized their intention to act at this final meeting of the year, as Kevin Granville reports in The New York Times. Unemployment is at 5 percent, about half its recession rate. Confidence in jobs growth has replaced the concerns about turmoil in the global economy. Many of these problems still remain, as The Financial Times explains, and others have reared their heads. The junk bond boom has fizzled and could signal broader problems in the economy. There have also been some indicators that have made it harder to judge how effective the Fed’s policies were, especially as the circumstances that drove it to act were so unusual. For example, saving has risen in spite of exceptionally low rates, as The Wall Street Journal reports. The personal saving rate has averaged 5.7 percent of disposal income since the recession ended, compared with 3.9 percent during the previous period of growth, partly because of households’ trying to rebuild wealth lost during the recession. The low rates may also have increased the cost of retirement and prompted people to save more. And concerns do remain. Eduardo Porter suggests in the Economic Scene column that the Fed may have underestimated the benefits of allowing higher inflation and avoiding the trap of the “zero lower bound,” in which interest rates could not be lowered any further to stimulate a stagnant economy because they had already hit the floor. “The risk of hitting the zero bound has risen, as slow population growth, strong inflows of capital from overseas and other market forces outside the Fed’s control have conspired to push interest rates down,” Mr. Porter writes. “That leaves less space to lower rates in response to a recession.” The Financial Times argues in an editorial that it is still too early for liftoff and that the Fed should stop using the same measures as it did before the global financial crisis to make its decision. “The world has changed very radically since the U.S. last increased rates,” it wrote. “The latitude the Fed gives itself within its framework should change too.” The one place where a rate increase is unlikely to create much difference is in Europe, Jack Ewing reports in The New York Times. The continent is more worried about why Europe is not responding to the help it is getting from its own central bank and the constant signaling from the Fed means that many markets have already priced in the likelihood of a Fed rate rise. Ms. Yellen will hold a news conference after the policy statement is published in which she will explain why liftoff from zero is (or isn’t) warranted. She’s also expected to address issues like the risks of weakness in the high-yield bond market. As Bloomberg notes in its guide to decision day, it is worth watching for dissent among officials and looking at the chart showing their projections for where rates will be in the future to see how quickly the Fed will push up interest rates over the next year.  BATTERED, APOLOGETIC AND STILL PITCHING HEDGE FUNDS  |  It has been such a bruising year for hedge funds that some managers have had to write apology letters to their investors, but that hasn’t stopped them from soliciting more money with the promise of better opportunities,
Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook. John A. Paulson of Paulson & Company is nursing losses in three funds while raising money for a private equity fund and a fund focused on health care stocks. Larry Robbins, who founded Glenview Capital Management, lost 20 percent through October and sent an apology to his investors. In the same letter, he offered them the opportunity to invest in a new fund and sweetened the offer by not charging fees on the new portfolio. The fund-raising highlights the fact that pension funds still want to invest in hedge funds, even as they complain about high fees and disappointing performance. Mediocre returns just mean that some investors have just pulled out from the underperforming funds, like Mr. Paulson’s Advantage fund, which is down 11 percent for the year. Some of this money is redeployed elsewhere, sometimes even to other portfolios managed by the same manager. The Advantage fund has been supplanted by another fund that makes bets on mergers and acquisitions, which now manages more than $9 billion in assets and has taken some of the investor money once directed to the Advantage portfolio.

Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. It remains to be seen whether that is any good for the rest of us. The move to split almost immediately into three companies afterward is risky and raises questions about why the companies committed to it. The answer is: activist shareholders. They are willing to agitate for change at any company and are often looking for an event to capture more immediate value. A sale or a spinoff could be a good option. Funds and shareholders are not looking to do the hard work of a turnaround, Mr. Solomon writes. They want to perform some financial engineering and a spinoff is the ultimate exercise in that. The theory is that a spinoff would allow the company to be more focused, but in practice, studies show that they produce only short term gains. They are less successful over the long term. Despite the questionable evidence to support them, spinoffs are still thriving because companies are scared and shareholders are much more powerful than they have ever been. Institutional shareholders often hold almost a majority of a public company and often they pay attention to proxy advisory services and vote as a group. They also increasingly throw their support behind the activists. Is this a good thing? It could end up harming shareholders and everyone else involved in the corporate enterprise, Mr. Solomon writes.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Global Payments to Buy Heartland Payment for $4.3 Billion  |  The merger would be the latest in the payments industry as companies around the world continue to move toward e-commerce of all types.

100,Farhad and Mike’s Week in Tech: Tempering Walmart’s Digital Ambitions,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/technology/farhad-and-mikes-week-in-tech-tempering-walmarts-digital-ambitions.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-12T14:30:17+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike: Aloha, Farhad! Another day in paradise. And I mean that literally. It’s mid-December and 65 degrees in New York. I’m actually wearing aloha shirts to work. Farhad: There’s a huge storm here in San Francisco. It was hailing last night. Oh, my god, I can’t believe we’ve sunk to talking about the weather. This might be the most boring newsletter yet. Mike: I can segue to weather tech. Dark Sky is a great weather app. O.K., on with the show. The weeks leading up into the holidays have been surprisingly eventful. Yahoo was going to spin off its multibillion-dollar stake in Alibaba, then decided it would probably make more economic sense to just spin itself off. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, announced the enormous shift in company strategy on Wednesday morning, then proceeded to go into labor and deliver identical twins. In news unrelated to struggling companies or childbirth, Atlassian, an enterprise collaboration software company, had a successful initial public offering this week — a sentence that made me fall asleep just typing it. Farhad: You are really going out of your way to bore our readers this week. I commend you. Mike: It’s also worth noting that Airbnb keeps claiming that it is trying to be more transparent with its data on how people use its service, saying it wants to work with cities and regulators. Apparently, Airbnb’s definition of transparency is the obfuscation of its data to make it fit its more pleasant, populist narrative. Color me wholly unsurprised. Oh, I should mention that Gizmodo and Wired seem to have found another culprit who could be the pseudonymous inventor, or inventors, of Bitcoin known as Satoshi Nakamoto. To me, the biggest surprise here is that people still care about Bitcoin. Farhad: Yes, the effort to unmask the creator of Bitcoin gave me flashbacks to 2013. But now that the articles in Wired and Gizmodo already seem to be falling apart, I’m a bit more interested. By which I mean, I am not totally asleep. Mike: I do want to talk a bit about digital currency. This week, Walmart announced that it was also jumping into the fray of digital wallets and would offer its customers a way to pay for stuff at its stores using Walmart’s own app. It’s called Walmart Pay — a wildly creative title — and is basically an extension of Walmart’s already successful mobile app. It is based on QR-code technology, which is pretty similar to bar code scanning in retail stores. When customers get to the Walmart checkout line, they open the app and present a digital code to the cashier. That code is connected with a payment method — a credit card or Walmart gift card, for example — and is used to pay for their stuff. Now, I have a lot of thoughts on the complications of this, but I would like to let you go first, mostly so I can knock down all of your terrible arguments. Farhad: I’ve got to say, I don’t really get this move. Sure, I understand why Walmart wants to be in the payments game. It has been leading the fight against credit card companies over “swipe fees” — the fraction of each purchase that Walmart pays Visa and MasterCard when customers use credit cards. The app helps in that fight. By linking directly to your bank account, Walmart could bypass credit card processors when you shop there. But that is only if a lot of people use it. And does anybody think that will happen? I am very skeptical. I’m one of the most tech-obsessed nerds around, but I barely ever use Apple Pay when I’m out shopping. Sure, it may be a bit faster to pull out my phone than my credit card, but the difference is so slight that I don’t really see the point. And Walmart’s QR-code idea sounds like a bigger headache still. Why would anyone use that over a plain old credit card? Mike: So you’re scratching at a problem that Apple and Google are still trying to solve. That is to say, some people think it’s a solution in search of a problem. We have spent decades swiping cards with little problem, so it will take decades more to change that behavior. Do I think a QR code will be the way to change it? No way. It’s clunky. You have to persuade people to take out their phones, open the app, scan it and so on. Apple can barely convince people to wave their smartphone over a payment terminal. And for about five years now, Google has not convinced anyone to do anything. A slightly wonky aside: Walmart was leading the charge on MCX, another QR-code-based payments app created by merchants who wanted to bypass credit card networks and increase their profit margin. Walmart effectively ditching MCX, and all of its other large merchant partners, to work on its own code-based system is basically calling the whole thing a huge embarrassing failure. And to be fair to Walmart, it definitely was. Here’s the bull case: Walmart has some 22 million people using its app already. I think that’s even more than Starbucks’s app, which is hugely successful. So if you can funnel all of those people who already use the Walmart app to search for coupons and buy things via their phones into opening that app at the register, bully for them! Still, that’s a big if. And, as I have said before, QR codes are so lame. But who knows? I certainly won’t count them out quite yet. Farhad: Do you know what would be truly useful? Imagine if the app didn’t just help you pay at checkout, but also let you scan all your goods as you took them off the shelf — allowing you to complete your purchase from anywhere in the store, and bypass the checkout lines entirely. Sure, there are some security issues with this idea, but there are ways around them. I know because one of Walmart’s tech executives showed me a pilot-test of this idea in a Silicon Valley store a few years ago. But it doesn’t sound as if we are anywhere close to seeing it in any stores. Mike: That is actually a rad idea. Sort of Apple-ish. Farhad: In the meantime, long live QR codes. Have fun in the sun, Mike! Mike: Gracias! May your days be less cloudy and more bright.",0.1493970149253731,0.09251187726334316
101,Morning Agenda: Dow Chemical and DuPont Said to Discuss Merger,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/morning-agenda-dow-chemical-and-dupont-said-to-discuss-merger/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-09T11:07:41+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"DOW CHEMICAL AND DUPONT SAID TO DISCUSS MERGER  |  Two of the biggest and oldest companies in the American chemical industry, Dow Chemical and DuPont, are in talks to merge in one of the largest transactions this year,
Leslie Picker and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.  People briefed on the matter said that the companies, each with a market value of about $60 billion, were discussing a merger that could  create the second-biggest chemical company in the world, after BASF, with more than $92 billion in annual sales. They are also talking about breaking up the merged company into three businesses — agricultural chemicals, specialty products, and materials like plastics.  Both companies have come under attack from activist investors unhappy with their financial performance. Dow settled a dispute with Daniel S. Loeb by adding four independent directors. DuPont managed to fend off a board challenge from Nelson Peltz this year.  Both Mr. Loeb and Mr. Peltz had argued that the chemical makers were suffering from corporate bloat. The companies said they were taking steps to trim costs, improve operations, buy back shares and increase stock dividends.  While Dow shares have remained flat since it settled, DuPont stock has fallen 11 percent since it won its battle with Mr. Peltz. Shares in both companies rose after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks.  
 YAHOO SAID TO END PLAN FOR ALIBABA SPIN OFF  |  Yahoo will abandon its plans to spin off its $31 billion stake in Alibaba, Michael J. de la Merced and Vindu Goel report in The New York Times. Instead it will look at other options, like selling its core operations or spinning off its stake in Yahoo Japan, according to people briefed on the matter.  The decision is a repudiation of the strategy taken by Marissa Mayer, who was hired to turn the struggling Internet company around. She had planned to spin off the 15 percent stake in Alibaba and focus on the core business of selling advertising.  But investors, led by the hedge fund Starboard Value, argued that the risk of capital gains tax was too great.  Instead, it pushed for a sale of the Internet operations, which could attract interest from telecommunications and cable companies, as well as private equity companies. Yahoo could also spin off its Internet operations, leaving the investments in Alibaba and Yahoo in the original company.  Alternatives include leaving the investments untouched and slimming down the Internet business, or putting up  the whole company for sale.  “I’d expect them quite honestly to look at all of these scenarios,” said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who published a detailed argument against the spinoff before the board met. Yahoo shares rose about 3 percent in after-hours trading after CNBC first reported the decision to table the spinoff.  
 NORFOLK SOUTHERN SNUBS CANADIAN PACIFIC  |  Norfolk Southern rejected a second offer to merge with Canadian Pacific, saying that it created “substantial regulatory risks and uncertainties that are highly unlikely to be overcome,”
Leslie Picker and Chad Bray report in DealBook. It added that the revised proposal was lower in value than the previous one and “grossly inadequate.”  Canadian Pacific had offered Norfolk Southern investors $32.86 in cash in 18 months and 0.451 shares of stock in a new holding company that would own both railroads for each Norfolk Southern share. It had offered 0.348 shares in the new company and $46.72 in cash in two years last month.  Norfolk Southern said the new offer valued it at $27.4 billion compared with $28 billion in the previous offer.  Canadian Pacific said that it estimated that the new offer would value Norfolk Southern at as much as $42 billion based on the estimated value of the new holding company.  Canadian Pacific said the new proposal would also reduce the regulatory risk for Norfolk Southern shareholders, while giving them a larger ownership stake in the combined company of about 47 percent. The Canadian rail operator’s pursuit of Norfolk Southern has become personal as the company and its largest shareholder, William A. Ackman, have hammered away at the track record of James A. Squires, Norfolk Southern’s chief executive.  Mr. Ackman said in a conference call outlining the new bid that Mr. Squires’s background in law made him less qualified to fix operational problems at the railroad operator.  Canadian Pacific’s efforts to devise a deal suggest that approval by rail regulators will not come easy, Robert Cyran and Kevin Allison write in Breakingviews.  Investors already seemed focused on the complexity of the offer.  Under the proposed terms, the two companies would be run separately and held in a temporary trust while the Department of Transport’s regulatory agency reviewed the merger.  Norfolk Southern’s stock price declined 5.7 percent to $86.32, while Canadian Pacific’s slipped 3.3 percent to $126.13. The argument that combined ownership and a move by Canadian Pacific’s chief executive, E. Hunter Harrison, to Norfolk Southern would still leave the two railroads notionally independent certainly requires mental acrobatics, Mr. Cyran and Mr. Allison noted.

 SKY-HIGH FEES FOR STELLAR RETURNS  |  As an asset class and with the right fund, private equity is nigh unbeatable and well worth the fees paid,  Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, prompted a debate about whether pension funds are getting what they pay for when it disclosed that it had paid $3.4 billion in fees to private equity funds over the last 25 years.  But private equity earned its keep, Mr. Solomon says.  The pension fund’s private equity portfolio earned $24.2 billion over those 25 years. It returned 12.3 percent over the last 20 years after fees.  Last year, Calpers earned 1 percent investing in stocks compared with its 8.9 percent gain from private equity. Without private equity, Calpers would be in much worse shape.  Perhaps Calpers could have negotiated a better deal, but 12 percent of the total is still less than the standard 20 percent in profits that private equity firms usually charge.  Yale has also managed to beat Harvard with the help of a 36.1 percent return on its private equity portfolio, which it made a big bet on.  That said, not everyone finds such fantastic returns.  Studies have shown that the bigger and longer-lasting funds like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Apollo are more profitable. And endowments have typically had better access to these.  We should balance the criticism of private equity firms’ fees with the great demand for private equity investments and the important role they play in meeting investors’ and pensioners’ needs, Mr. Solomon argues.     |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Chinese Consortium Makes Rival Bid for Fairchild Semiconductor  |  The group’s $2.5 billion offer tops a deal with ON Semiconductor and may ignite a bidding war.NYT »

102,Australian Police Raid Home of Man Said to Be Likely Creator of Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/world/australia/sydney-bitcoin-raid.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-12-09T08:25:18+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian authorities on Wednesday raided the home of a computer expert and entrepreneur in suburban Sydney, just hours after two news outlets identified the man as a likely creator of the digital currency Bitcoin. The Australian Federal Police said the raid on the residence of the man, Craig Steven Wright, was for a tax investigation, and a spokesman said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The Australian Taxation Office, which asked the police to carry out the raid, declined to comment on “any individual’s or entity’s tax affairs.” The raid, in the leafy suburb of Gordon on Sydney’s upper north shore, came hours after reports in Wired magazine and Gizmodo drew strong links between Mr. Wright and Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the virtual currency that has grown to billions of dollars in total value. The identity of Mr. Nakamoto has been a mystery since the currency’s computer code was released in 2009, with several false leads having been aired and debunked. The growing value of Bitcoin, which is managed by computers that run its peer-to-peer software, has driven the search for its creator or creators. Wired, which was first to identify Mr. Wright as a possible inventor of the currency, cited old blog posts as well as leaked documents and emails. The magazine acknowledged that the trail of clues could be a hoax, but it added: “If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as Bitcoin itself.” The Gizmodo report said that Mr. Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, “were involved in the development of the digital currency.” Both outlets cited what was described as a transcript of a 2014 meeting among Mr. Wright, lawyers and tax officials, in which he is quoted as saying, “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I’ve been running Bitcoin since 2009.” “By the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know,” he added, according to the transcript. Efforts to reach Mr. Wright on Wednesday were unsuccessful. A Newsweek investigation in 2014 incorrectly identified the Bitcoin creator as Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living with his mother in Southern California. He denied the report, saying he had only learned of Bitcoin weeks earlier after a reporter contacted his son.",-0.043393749999999995,0.012152777777777776
103,Morning Agenda: Treasury Secretary Warns Foes of Dodd-Frank,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/morning-agenda-treasury-secretary-warns-foes-of-dodd-frank/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-11-25T11:12:29+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"TREASURY SECRETARY WARNS FOES OF DODD-FRANK  |  Last year, Congress passed a measure dismantling a piece of the Dodd-Frank Act that governed swaps by attaching the new legislation to a wider spending bill. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned critics of Dodd-Frank against trying the same tactic again, saying he would  push back against any attempts to weaken financial regulation through amendments to the spending bill, which Congress must pass by Dec. 11 to avert a government shutdown,  Peter Eavis reports in DealBook. “I have publicly made clear that my recommendation to the president would be that if there are legislative measures that will roll back the clock, that would take us back toward where we were before the financial crisis,  I would recommend a veto,” Mr. Lew said via email.   What critics of Dodd-Frank are focusing on this time around is the  regulation mandating annual tests for banks to determine whether they could survive extreme stress in the markets and wider economy, Mr. Eavis writes. Currently, the rule applies to  banks with at least $50 billion in assets, but legislation introduced by Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, would  raise that threshold to $500 billion. Lawmakers are also  taking aim at the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which they say lacks accountability   Mr. Lew’s remarks may not deter Republican lawmakers from attaching amendments to the spending bill if they believe that the Obama administration would be  more likely to compromise on financial regulation than on other areas, like health care, Mr. Eavis writes. Also, another victorious effort to weaken parts of Dodd-Frank would “establish a track record of chipping away at the overhaul each year,” he writes. 
 CALPERS REVEALS PRIVATE EQUITY FEES AND PROFITS  |  On Tuesday, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System disclosed for the first time that it had  paid $3.4 billion since 1990 to big private equity firms, including Carlyle, Blackstone and Apollo – an announcement that “could help to pave the way to more transparency in the private equity industry,”  Alexandra Stevenson writes in DealBook. Calpers also said private equity firms’ investments generated  $24.2 billion in profits over the same period, according to its new data-collecting program, called Private Equity Accounting and Reporting.  Pension funds across the country have expressed concerns about high private equity fees, which typically include a management fee of 1 to 2 percent of assets and about 20 percent of profits. But many firms also charge fees related to transactions, monitoring investments and legal work. What Calpers  didn’t disclose was the breakdown of these fees, said J. J Jelincic, a member of the Calpers board. “We certainly know more than we did before,” Mr. Jelincic said. “But  it’s not the complete story yet.”  Calpers has been working to streamline its external investments, announcing plans to liquidate $4 billion in hedge fund investments and to get rid of half of its external money managers. But Calpers said it would  continue to invest in private equity, which had “the highest net returns” in its portfolio, according to Ted Eliopoulos, the chief executive of Calpers. The pension fund’s private equity investments have yielded  a return of 11.1 percent since 1990, compared with a 9.4 percent annualized total return across the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the same period, Ms. Stevenson writes.
 
 A SEASON OF SILLY DEAL-MAKING  |  In  this week’s Deal Professor column, Steven Davidoff Solomon looks at a recent series of deals that leave him shaking his head and wondering whether deal-makers have lost their minds. “Perhaps it is end-of-the-year exhaustion as we sputter toward the finish of a five-year market rally, but normally sober-minded business executives seem to have  thrown over sound decision making for flights of fancy,” he writes.   The prime example is  Pfizer’s merger with Allergan, a $152 billion deal that was driven mainly by a desire to lower taxes. First of all, he writes, “nothing suggests that Washington will not examine this transaction and enact new regulations to block it.” Second, he writes, “Pfizer says its taxes are too high, yet it never even paid those taxes.” Pfizer says that its tax rate is 27.5 percent, but it is actually  closer to 12 percent, Professor Solomon writes.   The other examples he lists are  Mylan’s failed $26 billion hostile bid for Perrigo,  Square’s initial public offering at a valuation lower than what it was valued at its last round of private financing, and  William A. Ackman’s loyalty to Valeant despite the company’s troubles. “Is there any unifying theme to this?” Professor Solomon asks. “It may very well be that the market is punch drunk with exhaustion after a long rally, but there may be another explanation.”   He points to the Pfizer chief executive’s argument that the merger was actually good for the United States as an example of the  “obtuse thinking” that has characterized recent deals. “Safe in their cocoons, business leaders seem to have perhaps  slightly lost their touch with reality,” Professor Solomon writes. “What we may see as silliness, to them is rational business.”

 BUREACRACY ENDS EXPERIMENTAL CREDIT UNION  |  When Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, opened the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union in 2012, he was trying something novel in creating a banking institution for social good, not for profit, and one that would provide banking services to Bitcoin companies. Now Mr. Kahle is giving up on the experiment, finding the regulatory audits and limits on his business too cumbersome,  writes Nathaniel Popper in DealBook. For example, in August, the credit union said it spent  187 hours dealing with regulators and only  61 hours dealing with customers. “I think we could really use some new ideas in the banking world — and the credit union offers a nice structure,” Mr. Kahle said. “But they just won’t allow it.”   “Mr. Kahle’s experience and internal documents offer a glimpse into  how regulators approach a new technology like Bitcoin, which most banks have refused to touch, partly because of the hesitation of regulators,” Mr. Popper writes. “More broadly, the troubles faced by his Internet Archive Federal Credit Union point to  how difficult it can be to try out anything new in the heavily regulated industry.”    In observance of the Thanksgiving holiday, there will be no DealBook newsletter on Thursday and Friday.

104,Dream of New Kind of Credit Union Is Extinguished by Bureaucracy,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/business/dealbook/dream-of-new-kind-of-credit-union-is-burdened-by-bureaucracy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-11-24T23:13:16+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Brewster Kahle didn’t need to start a bank. He made a fortune building start-ups and then used his money to build the Internet Archive, a nonprofit trying to maintain a copy of everything published on the Internet. In 2008, though, Mr. Kahle saw how hard it was for the employees at his firm to obtain loans, and more broadly, how the existing financial system had helped contribute to the financial crisis. He thought he could do things differently, and he aimed to prove it when he began applying to open a credit union in early 2011. Since then, the credit union has faced a barrage of regulatory audits and limitations on its operations, first when it tried to work with low-income immigrants in New Jersey and especially after it looked at providing banking services to Bitcoin companies that were being rejected by other banks. Now, Mr. Kahle is giving up on his dream of creating a new kind of bank, one for social good rather than profit. He hopes to give the credit union charter to a nonprofit organization in New Jersey that can make use of it — or give it up. Mr. Kahle’s experience and internal documents offer a glimpse into how regulators approach a new technology like Bitcoin, which most banks have refused to touch, partly because of the hesitation of regulators. More broadly, the troubles faced by his Internet Archive Federal Credit Union point to how difficult it can be to try out anything new in the heavily regulated industry. After an 18-month application process, regulators let the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union open in 2012, but with restrictions that did not allow it to offer basic banking products, such as debit cards and online banking. Mr. Kahle said the credit union asked its regulators before it took on the first Bitcoin clients — and quickly dropped those clients after the regulators turned sour on the idea — but it has faced a steady stream of official exams since: 11 in 14 months. In August, the credit union, by its own count, spent 187 hours dealing with regulators and only 61 hours dealing with customers. “I think we could really use some new ideas in the banking world — and the credit union offers a nice structure,” Mr. Kahle said. “But they just won’t allow it.” A spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency whose board is appointed by the president, said it would not comment on Mr. Kahle’s specific complaints, but in a statement, the chairwoman of the agency, Debbie Matz, a Democrat, said that “if a credit union thinks it’s going to be cited for breaking the law, sometimes a C.E.O. will push back and blame the regulator. It’s our job to protect depositors.” The chief executive of Mr. Kahle’s credit union, Jordan Modell, said that the N.C.U.A. had never given him any indication that the credit union would be cited for breaking the law. Mr. Modell and Mr. Kahle said the red flags raised by the N.C.U.A. examiners had been over small discrepancies and record-keeping issues — and often turned out to be factually wrong. “None of the compliance issues listed in the report were correct,” the credit union wrote in an appeal sent to the N.C.U.A. in May, after the agency lowered the credit union’s regulatory rating. The credit union administration has faced criticism from the newest of its three board members, J. Mark McWatters, a Republican, who has said that the agency has been too focused on protecting its insurance fund for credit unions from any losses and has consequently prevented credit unions from growing and serving customers. At a conference for credit union executives this year, Mr. McWatters told the audience that it deserved a “rethinking of the relentless barrage of rules and regulations visited upon your organizations by N.C.U.A. and other regulators.” Credit unions are like banks that are owned by their customers, rather than shareholders seeking profit. In the United States, most credit unions are overseen by the N.C.U.A., which plays a role similar to the one the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does for traditional banks. Although credit unions were viewed as a potential alternative to banks after the financial crisis, the number of credit unions in the United States has been shrinking each year since the crisis. There are around 6,300 credit unions, down from 7,000 in 2012 and 8,400 in 2007. Mr. Kahle, who has an inventor’s shock of gray, frizzy hair, went to work on the credit union in early 2011 with Mr. Modell, an old friend who had experience in banking. An eager and easily excitable man, Mr. Modell was set to handle the day-to-day operations while Mr. Kahle put up $1 million of his own money to serve as a capital cushion to protect the credit union from any losses. Mr. Modell said that during the 18-month application process, he and Mr. Kahle made 4,756 changes to their application and made it through only because of Mr. Kahle’s wealth. “I could afford to say yes at every turn — every time they made some weird demand,” Mr. Kahle said. When they did get their charter from the N.C.U.A. in August 2012 — the first new credit union chartered that year — the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union was limited by the regulators to loans of $5,000 or less, and it could generally serve only people in a small area around New Brunswick, N.J., where the credit union was located. The credit union aimed to provide financial services to poor immigrants, and its opening was attended by the Mexican consul general in New York. But Mr. Modell said that with the restrictions placed on it, the credit union would only have been able to give out what amounted, in practice, to predatory payday loans, which he did not want to do. Mr. Modell said he accepted the restrictions because he was assured that they would be lifted within a few months. When that did not happen, Mr. Modell and Mr. Kahle began looking at opening basic accounts for companies using the Bitcoin currency, given Mr. Kahle’s own experience with technological innovation. When the N.C.U.A. expressed displeasure with the decision Mr. Modell said, the credit union dropped the two Bitcoin companies it had taken on. The credit union’s other ideas for expansion were also shot down. In 2014, the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union tried to team up with an organization for migrant workers, the Farmworker Support Committee, to offer bank accounts and cheaper money transfers, but the idea was eventually rejected by an N.C.U.A. examiner. The N.C.U.A. sent its examiners on an increasingly frequent basis and requested more and more monthly reports from Mr. Modell — often asking about the credit union’s past interest in Bitcoin customers. By mid-2014, the credit union had made less than $50,000 in loans and Mr. Kahle suggested to Mr. Modell that it was time to give up. Mr. Modell resisted and offered to stop taking a salary. But he, too, became increasingly frustrated, particularly after the N.C.U.A. cited the credit union for refinancing a small loan that was past due. “That was actually a sound and safe business decision and the reason credit unions were created in the first place,” Mr. Modell wrote in a letter to the N.C.U.A. “The member was out of work and in contact with us.” Mr. Modell has since tried to keep the credit union alive but recently consented to Mr. Kahle’s desire to give up on the project. “The original vision of this thing — of helping nonprofit workers, or helping the poor — they will not allow it,” Mr. Kahle said.",0.150175,0.024044891946677655

Leslie Picker and Mike Isaac report in DealBook. Lyft, the ride-hailing start-up, is seeking to raise about $500 million at a valuation of $4 billion, according to four people briefed on the round. Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, is valued at about $2.5 billion.  At a conference on Tuesday, Lyft said it expected to generate about $1 billion in annualized gross revenue next year, not including the cut the drivers take from each transaction.  Uber has also intensified conversations with investors about another round of funding, which is expected to close in December. It is hoping to raise about $1 billion at a valuation of $60 billion to $70 billion. It is currently valued at about $50 billion.  The Financial Times reports that India’s leading taxi-hailing app Ola has raised $500 million in fresh capital at a valuation of around $5 billion.  The discussions over Lyft and Uber’s fundraising will give an indication of whether prominent private companies can continue to raise new capital, with big names like Snapchat and Dropbox being marked down by mutual fund investors. Fund-raising has remained brisk so far.  Both Uber and Lyft are betting on the car-pooling options they offer. Nearly half of Uber rides taken in San Francisco are UberPool rides, while the number tops 60 percent for Lyft in the same city. 
 APPETITE FOR RISKY LOANS WANES  |  Banks have postponed plans to sell several billion dollars’ worth of debt meant to support the Carlyle Group’s planned takeover of Symantec’s data storage business,  Michael J. de la Merced and Alexandra Stevenson report in DealBook. Investors have grown reluctant to place money in volatile markets and are more cautious about the market for junk bonds and riskier high-yield loans. The decision could leave the lenders, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, holding several billion dollars’ worth of debt on their books for at least a month, potentially leading to millions of dollars in losses.  Carlyle had agreed, along with a consortium of investors that include Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, to acquire Veritas Technologies from Symantec for $8 billion. Some had already said that the deal was too indebted.  The deal is backed by more than $5 billion of debt and the lenders had already extended the bridge financing, which was meant to temporarily support the transaction until they could subsequently sell loans and bonds to investors and remove the risk from their books.  The banks had already sold off a portion of the debt, but they encountered resistance when they ventured into the debt markets. Investors wanted better terms for the offering.  The lenders bumped up the interest rate on the bonds and lowered the price of the loans, but they continued to balk.  The banks intend to try again in January, according to a person briefed on the deal.  Symantec said the deal would still close by Jan. 1 of next year. “The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, although there is no financing contingency associated with the closing of the deal,” a spokesman said in a statement.  
 AIR LIQUIDE TO ACQUIRE AIRGAS  |  The French industrial gas company Air Liquide has agreed to buy Airgas for $10.3 billion in a deal that could swell the company’s presence in the United States,
Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. The transaction is friendly, and the agreed-upon offer was $143 a share in cash. Air Liquide will assume $2.8 billion of Airgas debt. The deal represents a total enterprise value of $13.4 billion and both boards have approved the merger. Shares of Airgas jumped 29 percent on Tuesday.  Airgas is one of the largest United States suppliers of industrial, medical and specialty gases, with 17,000 employees. The company had already fended off a $5.9 billion hostile takeover by Air Products and Chemicals, an American rival.  Airgas will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Liquide, which operates in 80 countries. Air Liquide said the deal would increase its gas and services sales by more than 30 percent.

 CANADIAN PACIFIC TAKES MERGER BID TO NORFOLK SOUTHERN  |  In a proposed merger that could reshape the North American rail industry, Canadian Pacific has offered the Norfolk Southern Corporation $46.72 in cash and 0.348 of a Canadian Pacific share for each Norfolk Southern share,
Liz Moyer and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.  Canadian Pacific declined to disclose details, but Norfolk Southern outlined the takeover and said it would consider what it called an “unsolicited, low-premium, nonbinding, highly conditional indication of interest.”  At closing prices on Tuesday, the offer valued Norfolk Southern at about $94.95 a share, representing a premium of about 9 percent for a total of $28.4 billion.  The exchange is the latest effort to consolidate the North American rail industry. Canadian Pacific made an offer for CSX a year ago, but the United States railroad operator spurned the offer.  During a previous encounter, Jim Squires, the chief at Norfolk Southern, told his counterpart at Canadian Pacific, E. Hunter Harrison, that he did not believe a merger made sense and that it was unlikely to pass regulatory muster.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Marriott Merger Has Starwood Lovers Nervous  |  Every big hotel chain has a loyalty program, but Starwood Preferred Guest stands out for the way it pampers the company’s most frequent customers, and its fans fear a takeover by Marriott will cut into their perks.The Upshot »  Goldman Sachs Casts Focus on Millennial Women  |  The bank, along with Teen Vogue magazine, has published its third-annual survey of millennial women’s fashion and beauty brand loyalties.NYT »

The price of a single Bitcoin has been steadily rising in recent weeks. On Wednesday, it spiked particularly sharply, rising above $500 on some exchanges, and bringing the value of a single coin up over 100 percent from a month ago. By the end of Wednesday, the price had fallen back closer to $400. The recent rally has been the biggest since the online currency entered a sustained decline after the collapse of what was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, in early 2014. That incident — and the use of Bitcoin for drug sales — led many people to write off the virtual money as a passing fad. Nonetheless, many banks and financial firms continued to study the technology behind the scenes and have recently been expressing their interest — and announcing new investments — in the technology underlying Bitcoin, which is being heralded as a new way to conduct a broad array of financial transactions. There has also been a surge in demand for Bitcoin in China, where the new interest is being explained by a number of factors, including the drop in the stock market there, as well as the emergence of a new Ponzi scheme tied to Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has been rising faster on Chinese exchanges than elsewhere in the world. Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of China’s biggest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, said that, as was the case in past price spikes, a critical mass of reports on Bitcoin was drawing a new wave of speculators, betting more on the future of the virtual currency than on its current use. “There are a few tipping points in a row, and you get a tidal wave,” Mr. Lee said. “It’s classic bull market.” Volatile price swings are nothing new for Bitcoin, which has been through several sharp ups and downs since it was released into the world in early 2009 by a shadowy creator going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In late 2013, the price shot to a peak above $1,200 in intraday trading. Past price rallies have generally been followed quickly by collapses, usually set off by some sign of weakness in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin industry. All along there has been skepticism when investor interest in Bitcoin has raced ahead of the real-world use of the virtual currency. While Bitcoin has been described as a faster and cheaper way to send money online, ordinary people have been slow to use the virtual currency for everyday transactions and there are no major signs that is changing. But the companies that currently handle most Bitcoin transactions seem to be far stronger than those that did in the past. New York’s top financial regulator has granted trust company charters to two Bitcoin exchanges over the last year and both are now in operation, along with a California exchange, Coinbase, which is the largest in the country. On Wednesday, Coinbase reported trading volume four times as high as its recent average. So far, big banks have not traded Bitcoin on these exchanges or invested in the virtual currency directly. But financial firms of all sorts have shown significant interest in the decentralized way in which Bitcoin transactions are handled and the new type of ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded, known as the blockchain. Last week, Nasdaq introduced a new system, Linq, that will allow shares in start-ups to be recorded and traded on a ledger like the blockchain, which is expected to manage trades more quickly than existing systems. Over a dozen banks, including most of the global giants, have recently joined with a start-up, R3 CEV, to define standards for new decentralized ledgers. Most financial firms insist that they want to use blockchains that are not tied to Bitcoin. But financial firms have also been making bets in Bitcoin-related companies like the Digital Currency Group, a trading and investment company that announced funding from MasterCard and CIBC last week. Brendan M. O’Connor, chief executive of Genesis Global Trading, a division of the Digital Currency Group, said that after every big funding announcement, he saw a spike from big institutional investors. “That is nudging people to get off the sidelines and invest in the asset class,” Mr. O’Connor said. Investors have also been comforted by decisions like one last month by the European Union, which said that basic Bitcoin transactions would not be taxed, but would instead be treated like currency transactions. But as was the case during the big Bitcoin run-up in late 2013, most of the trading activity now is taking place in China. Exchanges there have encouraged speculation in Bitcoin by offering free trading and leveraged accounts. There has been discussion recently that some Chinese investors are seeking out Bitcoin as China’s currency, the renminbi, has struggled and the government has made it harder to move money out of the country. Mr. Lee of BTCC said he was not seeing much of those sorts of transactions. But he said he had seen signs that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin to move money into an international investment scheme, MMM Global, which claims to have been created by a man who did prison time in Russia after a previous Ponzi scheme collapsed. Bitcoin also continues to be used for illegal purposes. After the Silk Road online drug bazaar was taken down, imitators quickly popped up to take its place. Bitcoin has also become the currency of choice for online ransom payments because Bitcoin addresses can be created without providing any personal information. The Cyber Threat Alliance released a report last week estimating that hackers had collected $325 million from CryptoWall, a virus that can freeze a computer’s files until an electronic ransom payment is made. Exchange operators, though, say that the new users rushing in in recent weeks have been making a bet that Bitcoin will go mainstream and rise in value as it does. “The main tangible driver of the recent price surge is the accumulation of all the investments and positive media about blockchain,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has followed the market.",0.08739318181818183,0.04048799685163321

But the details of this new technology have remained a mystery to most. Bitcoin is both a type of digital token, or virtual currency, and the network on which those tokens can be stored and moved around. Each unit of the virtual currency is nothing more than an entry on a digital ledger, just as most dollars and cents exist only as entries on a bank’s digital ledger. The price of a Bitcoin is set on the open market, generally on exchanges where people offer to buy and sell Bitcoin, similar to the way that a stock’s price is set. Normal currencies are, of course, tracked by banks — and their employees and computer systems. Bitcoins, in contrast, are kept on a ledger that is maintained and updated by any user of Bitcoin who wants to help. The constantly updated ledger is kept on the computers of all the users — just as Wikipedia entries are written and kept current by the encyclopedia’s users rather than by any central authority. The work maintaining Bitcoin’s ledger is done according to rules that are established by the Bitcoin software. It is the communally maintained ledger on which all Bitcoin accounts and transactions are recorded — known as the blockchain — that makes the currency so different from existing ones. Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin — just the network of users keeping the records — there is no one to shut down accounts or demand personal information from Bitcoin users. Anyone can open an account and spend whatever Bitcoins they have as long as they have the password — or secret key — for their account. From the moment the Bitcoin network started operating in 2009, a new bundle of Bitcoins — initially 50 — was released every 10 minutes or so, essentially for free, to one of the computers helping to update and maintain the blockchain ledger. Computers on the network take part in a sort of computational race to win these new coins, a process that came to be called Bitcoin mining. This giveaway provided an incentive for people to join and support the network with their computers. New coins will be released in this way until there are 21 million in the world (currently scheduled to happen sometime in 2140). Once a user wins a new bundle of Bitcoins he or she can divide them up in any way — up to eight decimal points — and distribute them to anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Initially, people sent their Bitcoins to friends for free. Now, there are exchanges on which people offer to buy and sell Bitcoins and the price has swung wildly, reaching a high above $1,200 in intraday trading in late 2013. Anyone with a Bitcoin address, which is similar to an email address, can send and receive Bitcoins from anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Creating a Bitcoin address is free. Each address comes with a private key, a sophisticated password, that provides access to the coins in the address. There are thousands of merchants that now accept Bitcoin payments online. These companies will generally provide a Bitcoin address where money can be sent in order to complete a transaction. For the merchants, Bitcoin is preferable to credit-card payments because the merchant doesn’t have to pay a fee to a credit-card company. For consumers with credit cards, there is less of a clear advantage to using Bitcoin. The online drug bazaar known as the Silk Road offered a place for vendors to sell illegal goods, like heroin and cocaine, for Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world almost instantly, essentially for free, and because the payments can be sent without either side knowing the identity of the other, the system is an obvious choice for criminal activity. Law enforcement officials have had some luck in tracking down Bitcoin users by looking at the I.P. address associated with a particular Bitcoin address, or by tracking down users on the blockchain ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. But this has proved to be a slow and relatively unsuccessful investigative method. The operator of the Silk Road was eventually apprehended, not because his Bitcoin transactions were traced, but because he accidentally left his personal email address on a public website. The Silk Road was quickly replaced by imitators that are still flourishing today, offering drugs for Bitcoins. The Silk Road helped demonstrate that Bitcoin could be used to send money quickly and cheaply around the world, without requiring a bank account. Slowly, there is increasing interest in using the Bitcoin network as a payment system for legitimate purposes. One often-discussed use is as way for immigrants to send remittances more cheaply to family members overseas who don’t have bank accounts or government identity cards. This has begun to catch on in places like Argentina, Indonesia and Africa. Other developers have looked to use Bitcoin for very small online payments, of a few cents, which are generally not possible in the existing financial system because of the minimum payments required for credit-card transactions. More recently, financial institutions have grown interested in the idea that the Bitcoin network — and its ledger, the blockchain — allows for direct online transactions of all sorts, even those that don’t involve Bitcoins. Banks and financial firms are now looking at using the blockchain to allow for cheaper, faster stock and bond trades.",0.151705,0.06287415824915825
108,"China, a Major Bitcoin Source, Considers Moving Against It",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/business/bitcoin-china-ban.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-04-09,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"HONG KONG — China is planning new steps that could put a stop to making Bitcoin there, a move that could cut off one of the world’s largest sources of the popular but unstable cryptocurrency. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, this week added cryptocurrency mining to a list of about 450 industries that it proposes to eliminate. If the move is approved, local governments in China will be prohibited from supporting makers of Bitcoin and other digital currencies through subsidies or other benefits. The commission said it would seek public comment until May 7 before making a final decision. China was once the world’s largest Bitcoin maker, though rising government pressure has forced many of those who make the cryptocurrency, known as miners, to other countries. Still, a number of Bitcoin miners could remain, especially if local governments ignored the instructions and found a way to prop up local producers, people in the business say. “It is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand, but it is not a ban,” said Zhao Qianjie, a former executive at BTCChina, which was China’s first cryptocurrency exchange. Instead, he said, some producers may learn to live without subsidies and benefits like discounted electricity. “The change will be the mining cost will rise,” said Mr. Zhao, who still owns a Bitcoin mine in China’s northern region of Inner Mongolia. Bitcoin miners use computers to crunch the mathematical formulas that create the basis for the currency. The business can be quite profitable, especially when Bitcoin prices are soaring, but the process requires amounts of electricity. Prices of the currency move up and down considerably and are currently above $5,000, according to Blockchain, a cryptocurrency firm. China initially embraced Bitcoin and saw local miners as the potential basis for a new industry focused on digital currencies. China also has plenty of power, thanks to its extensively built-out electricity system and the closing of a growing number of heavy industry factories as the economy matures. At one point, China accounted for roughly two-thirds of all Bitcoin produced. But China keeps a tight grip over how much money flows in and out of its borders, and cryptocurrencies — which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously — threatened to undermine those capital controls. Cryptocurrencies can also be used to circumvent laws to buy illegal goods, and Chinese officials were also spooked by the possibility that the wildly fluctuating prices could leave investors with big losses and lead to civil unrest. The Chinese authorities began to ratchet up pressure on Bitcoin miners. In 2017, China ordered cryptocurrency exchanges to close. It has also banned initial coin offerings, a method by which start-ups or online projects can raise funds by issuing cryptocurrency. Many miners began to hide or flee to places with friendlier laws or abundant electricity, including the United States. “All the policies have created fear,” said Chandler Guo, who owned Bitcoin mines in China but moved to Silicon Valley in 2016. “Many have moved abroad.” Still, China remains a significant force in the Bitcoin world. Based on different estimates, between 40 percent and 70 percent of the world’s mining power is still in China. The National Development and Reform Commission’s proposal is the first time a central government body has announced a restrictive policy on Bitcoin mining, and it could make it difficult for miners to get loans to expand, said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research organization in Beijing. “Local governments won’t act against it, so it will be more difficult for them to be approved or receive loans,” Mr. Wang said. Miners said that while the crackdown on cryptocurrency had driven some miners abroad, the total cost of mining was still lower in China, where most of the mining machines are produced. Yu Wei, a former executive with Bitmain, which makes products for mining cryptocurrencies, said the move could benefit the industry in the long run. “That means more miners will move abroad,” said Mr. Yu, who owns mines in Xinjiang and Yunnan Province in China, as well as in Central Asia. “That will be good for decentralization of cryptocurrency.”",0.030981818181818187,0.09404980541344177
109,Bitcoin’s ‘First Felon’ Faces More Legal Trouble,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/technology/bitcoin-charlie-shrem-winklevoss-twins.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-11-02T09:00:09+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Over the last year, Charlie Shrem, a 28-year-old Bitcoin investor, has bought two Maseratis, two powerboats — one of them 32 feet long — and a $2 million house in Florida, along with smaller pieces of real estate. In the world of cryptocurrencies, where millions can be made and lost in a day, that might not make Mr. Shrem stand out. But unlike most Bitcoin entrepreneurs, in 2016 Mr. Shrem got out of prison, where he spent a year after pleading guilty to illegally helping people turn dollars into Bitcoin to buy drugs online. Mr. Shrem, who had been the chief executive of Bitinstant, one of the first prominent Bitcoin businesses in the United States, has said in recent interviews that he went to prison with almost no money. So where did the money for the expensive toys come from? That’s what two former business partners want to know. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who turned money from a settlement with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg into a Bitcoin fortune, said they suspected Mr. Shrem had actually been spending Bitcoin that he owed them since 2012, according to a lawsuit unsealed in federal court on Thursday. The Bitcoin would be worth around $32 million at current prices. “Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or — more likely — he ‘acquired’ his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole from” the Winklevoss twins in 2012, the lawsuit says. The judge who oversaw Mr. Shrem’s earlier trial has already agreed to freeze some of Mr. Shrem’s financial assets, according to court documents. The lawsuit could blossom into an ever bigger problem for Mr. Shrem because an affidavit filed in court suggests that Mr. Shrem has also not paid the government $950,000 in restitution that he agreed to as part of his 2014 guilty plea. Mr. Shrem’s lawyer, Brian Klein, said in a statement that the claims by the Winklevoss brothers were baseless. “The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins,” he said. “Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name.”. The lawsuit from the twins threatens another reversal of fortune for Mr. Shrem, who went from being one of the earliest Bitcoin millionaires to being called Bitcoin’s “first felon.” When he was arrested in 2014, Mr. Shrem was accused by federal authorities of using his company, Bitinstant, to knowingly sell Bitcoin to people who wanted it to buy drugs from the online black market, Silk Road. Since his release in 2016, Mr. Shrem has said in numerous interviews that he recognizes his past mistakes and wants to cut a new and legal path. On the podcast “Death, Sex and Money,” Mr. Shrem said that in the first months out of prison, he worked as a dishwasher and didn’t look at his email. Over the last year, though, Mr. Shrem has already gotten involved with a number of troubled projects. He was among the leaders of two efforts — one a cryptocurrency credit card and the other an initial coin offering — that had to give money back to investors after various partnerships that Mr. Shrem had promised fell through. But those are likely to be mere headaches compared with what he could face in a confrontation with the Winklevoss twins. Mr. Shrem helped get the brothers interested in Bitcoin in 2012 and became their first adviser in the young industry. The twins asked Mr. Shrem to help them amass the beginnings of what would become an enormous stockpile of cryptocurrencies, giving him $750,000 to buy Bitcoin from other deep-pocketed investors. A few months into this partnership, the twins said, they realized that Mr. Shrem had not given them all the Bitcoin they were due. The brothers gave Mr. Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, but the lawsuit says that a month later, he delivered only around $189,000 worth of Bitcoin at the going price, which was around $12.50. The 5,000 or so missing Bitcoins became a point of tension between the twins and Mr. Shrem. They asked him numerous times for an accounting of the Bitcoins he had purchased and eventually brought in an accountant who documented the missing funds, according to court documents. “I have been patient, and at this point it’s getting a bit absurd,” Cameron Winklevoss wrote to Mr. Shrem in 2013 in an email quoted in the lawsuit. “I don’t take this lightly.” The missing Bitcoins, which were worth 98 percent less at the time, appeared to have been forgotten in a broader battle between the brothers and Mr. Shrem over an investment in Bitinstant. In 2013, Bitinstant fell apart, and the twins blocked Mr. Shrem’s efforts to revive the company with new investors because of their concerns about his management style. By the time Mr. Shrem was arrested in 2014, as a result of activities at Bitinstant that took place before the brothers invested, they had cut off contact with him. The Winklevoss twins’ problems with Mr. Shrem have not held them back. They were briefly each cryptocurrency billionaires last year, and they have built one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Gemini. Despite this year’s big drop in cryptocurrency prices, their holdings are still worth nearly a billion dollars. Cameron Winklevoss said that he and his brother decided to pursue the missing Bitcoins again after they saw Mr. Shrem’s recent spending patterns. “When he purchased $4 million in real estate, two Maseratis and two powerboats, we decided it was time to get to the bottom of it,” Mr. Winklevoss told The New York Times. The brothers hired an investigator, who found that 5,000 Bitcoins were transferred in 2013 through addresses associated with Mr. Shrem and onto the Bitcoin wallet services Xapo and Coinbase, according to the complaint. The investigator traced the money on the blockchain, the public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Jed S. Rakoff, a judge in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, approved an application the twins made in September to freeze any funds that Mr. Shrem holds with those companies. Judge Rakoff wrote in his order that Mr. Shrem had “evidenced an intent to frustrate the collection efforts of his creditors.” The court fight could cause problems for Mr. Shrem’s latest venture, Crypto.IQ. The company, which promises market intelligence to Bitcoin traders, is holding a conference for customers in Las Vegas this month promising “unparalleled insights from a roster of experts at the very epicenter of the crypto universe.” In an interview with Breaker magazine in September, Mr. Shrem said he was getting used to the ups and downs. “My personal life goes through bull and bear markets, too,” he said. “So the key is how to deal with it when you’re in the bear markets.”",-0.054467999999999996,-0.004977946127946132

It would be the biggest-ever takeover in the technology sector. The company is betting that its huge acquisition of another company grappling with swift changes in the technology industry will help it keep up with the times. Under the terms, Dell will pay the equivalent of $33.15 a share in a complicated transaction involving both cash and a special kind of stock. That price is about 27 percent higher than where EMC’s shares were trading before news of the deal first emerged. Dell is offering EMC shareholders both about $24.05 a share in cash and $9.10 worth of a so-called tracking stock for VMware that mirrors the roughly 20 percent of that company already trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Michael S. Dell took the company he founded private two years ago with the help of the investment firm Silver Lake. He wanted to shift toward corporate computing services without the glare of the public stock markets.
The purchase of EMC would give Dell one of the biggest names in data storage. “We’re continuing to evolve the company into the most relevant areas where I.T. is moving,” Mr. Dell said in an interview. “This deal just accelerates that.” Dell would acquire a huge amount of debt, but that money would be borrowed before an expected  increase in interest rates. Dell is also expanding at a time when companies believe smaller is better. Many tech companies have announced plans to split off into their components, each devoted to a particular part of the market. Hewlett Packard’s plan to split its enterprise-services business and personal computer business is nearly complete. EBay spun off PayPal from its e-commerce division. Proponents of breaking away from the conglomerate model argue that each business would have greater focus. EMC itself has been criticized for its collection of businesses. Mr. Dell and his counterpart at EMC, Joe Tucci, maintain that sticking with the one-stop-shop business model will draw corporate customers eager to buy servers. Dell’s business performance, at least, appears to be holding up. Its overall share of the global PC market has held steady at about 14 percent, in part because its sales have slipped less than those of its rivals. Taking EMC private could give it the same sort of breathing room Dell has enjoyed. 
 FERRARI LISTING MOVES FORWARD  |  The initial public offering market may not have looked so promising in recent weeks, but  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is still going spin off Ferrari at a valuation of $9.4 billion,
Leslie Picker reports in DealBook.  The luxury sports car maker will market 17.2 million shares for $48 to $52 each. Most of the proceeds from the $859 million listing will go to Fiat Chrysler, which will also maintain an 80 percent stake. Piero Ferrari, the son of the founder Enzo, will hold onto his 10 percent stake.  Ferrari shipped a mere 7,255 cars last year, a tactic the company uses to cultivate a reputation for exclusivity. But this low-volume strategy also limits revenue and profit growth. Ferrari’s stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RACE. 
 BANKERS GRAPPLE WITH EMERGING MARKETS  |  Bankers and policy makers want to stem the rush of investments out of emerging markets, but they can’t agree on how,
Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook. At the same time, fears abound that the flow out of emerging market stocks and bonds will worsen, especially if China’s currency weakens further. The root of the debate is whether the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates near zero has increased investor confidence in emerging markets or hurt it. The International Monetary Fund thinks the Federal Reserve should hold back on a rate increase because of the global economy is weak. But those on the front lines — central bankers in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Malaysia and Mexico — say the Fed’s restraint has made their job more difficult. Investors are rushing out even faster because they’re spooked that the Fed has larger fears about China and other emerging markets. Some argue that the money would continue to flow out regardless of the Fed’s movements. Chinese savers are looking to shift into dollars because the renminbi is expected to devalue more. Economists for countries vulnerable to outflows have called for capital controls to make it more difficult to take money out of these economies, but most central banks at the I.M.F. meetings in Lima rejected that. “The first thing an investor asks when he comes in is, ‘where is the exit,’” said Agustín Carstens, the head of Mexico’s central bank. “If he does not know where it is, he won’t come in.” The mantra for emerging-market governments is that they need to win back investor confidence by keeping their budget deficits and currency declines under control. Even so, analysts are not convinced that financial stability is possible without a firm sense of the Fed’s plans.

 E.U. BANKING CHAMPION WANTED  |  Two senior European bankers have voiced their fears about the finance sector on the continent.
John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays, told
The Financial Times that European investment banks should consider merging to compete with their rivals in the United States. “If you did want to create an investment banking champion for Europe, you would have to combine the investment banking arms of the main players, but you would have to swallow really hard and you would need political support,” he said. Frédéric Oudéa, chief executive of France’s Société Générale and president of the European Banking Federation, wrote in an F.T. op-ed that, “American investment banks are playing a bigger and bigger role in financing the global economy. A handful of robust U.S. universal banks are gaining market share abroad while strengthening their positions at home, in large part thanks to regulation that makes it more difficult for foreign players to operate in the U.S.” The comments highlight the angst that is growing over the industry in the region. European banks are cutting thousands of jobs and selling billions of euros of assets, while their rivals in the United States are expanding. “Americans do have the stronger positions than anyone else, and it is not quite game over but it is very severe,” Mr. McFarlane said. He did point out, however, that while he wouldn’t be opposed to a merger that was beneficial or neutral for Barclays’ shareholders, it didn’t seem realistic. The Bank of England will detail on Thursday how it will carry out the law to separate the retail arms of British banks from other operations. The move will make it hard for British banks to keep large investment banking operations.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  General Electric to Sell Part of Finance Unit to Wells Fargo  |  GE Capital is in advanced talks to sell a specialty finance portfolio worth more than $30 billion to Wells Fargo, The Financial Times reports, citing people familiar with the situation.

The twins, famous from their legal battles with Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, announced on Monday that they had received approval for their exchange from the New York State Department of Financial Services, the state’s top financial regulator. The agency, which has taken the lead in regulating the new virtual currency industry, had already approved another company, ItBit, to operate under a similar regulatory framework as a banklike trust company. The Winklevoss twins have been working on their exchange for more than a year, with help from veterans of other large technology companies. Gemini will hold customer money in federally insured bank accounts. The exchange aims to make it easier for large institutional investors to buy and sell Bitcoin. Wall Street banks have recently been expressing growing interest in harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin. But it is still unclear whether they and other large financial players will want to trade Bitcoin itself, as the Winklevoss twins are betting. Much of the interest from Wall Street is in the technology that allows direct digital transactions. The price of Bitcoin has been largely stagnant for most of this year and sits around $240 for a Bitcoin. ItBit, the other exchange, has not experienced outsize trade volumes so far. The Winklevoss twins have been actively working with Bitcoin since 2012. The first company they backed, BitInstant, did not survive. They quickly began working on a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund, which is expected to trade on the Nasdaq exchange. That fund is still waiting for regulatory approval. The twins have been vocal about the importance of working with regulators, rather than challenging the authorities, as some Bitcoin advocates have wanted to do. “Bitcoin is an island right now, and Gemini is building a bridge to the financial mainland,” Tyler Winklevoss, the chief executive of Gemini, said in a statement on Monday. “Gemini is simple and easy-to-use for a first-time Bitcoin buyer while at the same time powerful enough and feature-complete for a professional trader.”",0.29565555555555556,0.11035473785473787
112,Morning Agenda: Dollar Rises After Yellen’s Talk,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/morning-agenda-dollar-rises-after-yellens-talk/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-09-25T10:17:12+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"DOLLAR RISES AFTER YELLEN’S TALK  |  The dollar, Treasury yields and equities rose on Friday, after Janet L. Yellen said that the Federal Reserve still intended to raise its benchmark interest rate this year, The Financial Times reports.  The FTSE Eurofirst 300, a European stock barometer, was up 2.6 percent in early trading, while United States index futures suggested the S.&P. would open higher.   The demand for havens such as gold and the Japanese yen also eased. Asian markets were mixed on Friday, with the Hang Seng up 0.4 percent, but the Shanghai Composite down 1.6 percent.   The reiteration that a rate rise is coming continues to affect emerging market currencies. The Malaysian ringgit is at its weakest since the Asian financial crisis.   Ms. Yellen emphasized that the central bank was not planning to wait much longer, because labor market conditions were improving and inflation is still expected to follow, Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times.  Ms. Yellen played down the likelihood of delaying a rate increase because of slower growth in other countries.   “The committee is monitoring developments abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,” she said.  If growth fails to live up to Fed expectations, it might still delay an interest rate rise.   Ms. Yellen’s speech at the University of Massachusetts focused on explaining why the Fed expects inflation to return to a healthy annual rate of 2 percent.  Inflation has remained below 2 percent since the recession and prices have barely increased over the last year. Ms. Yellen acknowledged that economists do not entirely understand inflation movements, but said that the Fed remained confident in the longstanding view that inflation in the long term was determined by public expectations.   Inflation has been hampered by lower energy prices and a strong dollar. But Ms. Yellen said the economic slack was having less of an effect on keeping inflation low, so a rebound in inflation was expected.  Ms. Yellen also played down the importance of the decline in another measurement of inflation expectations, which is derived from the market prices of financial assets. She said recent declines most likely reflected other factors, like increased demand for safer assets, rather than a long-term shift. 
 VOLKSWAGEN EXPECTED TO NAME NEW CHIEF   |  Volkswagen is expected to name a new chief executive on Friday, Jack Ewing and
Melissa Eddy report in The New York Times.   Matthias Müller, who leads the division of Volkswagen that makes Porsches, is the most likely contender, according to people close to the company’s supervisory board.  The Porsche division has been untouched by the emissions scandal and accounts for most of the parent company’s profit, along with Audi.  The board is also expected to announce further management changes.  Pressure has continued to mount on the carmaker. Alexander Dobrindt, Germany’s transportation minister, said on Thursday that the software used to fool emissions tests might have been installed in millions of cars in Europe, not just the United States.  This means the deceptive software was more widely used than the company had disclosed and 10 million cars in Europe could be affected.  The European Commission urged its member nations to test vehicles. Investors are also nervous. Shares in BMW fell on Thursday after a magazine reported that one of its models produced suspicious test results. BMW denied the accusations. It is only a matter of time before the company has to deal with multiple civil and criminal penalties,
Peter J. Henning writes in the White Collar Watch column. The Environmental Protection Agency can impose penalties of up to $37,500 for every vehicle for violations of the Clean Air Act. Based on its sales of nearly 500,000 vehicles with the software installed, Volkswagen could face a penalty of $18 billion.  The Justice Department can also seek criminal punishment based on the same conduct. Volkswagen could also face fines based on its profits because of the violations or any losses suffered by victims as they failed to get the expected performance or mileage out of their vehicles.  The recent G.M. settlement is comparable because it involved criminal charges for making false statements to the government and wire fraud. Those charges will be dismissed if G.M. fulfills the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement — the outcome of its cooperation with the investigation.  To get a nice deal like G.M.’s, Volkswagen would have to demonstrate its cooperation by providing information on violations, including by executives, Mr. Henning says.  When Martin Winterkorn referred to the “terrible mistakes made by only a few” and maintained that he was unaware of any wrongdoing, it appeared that senior management was trying to put the focus on lower level employees.  The challenge for prosecutors will be getting information that implicates people higher up.  While many have been surprised that this happened at the largest carmaker in the world, Volkswagen’s history, culture and corporate structure make it a mystery that a scandal like this didn’t happen sooner,  James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column. Volkswagen’s recent history — a decades-long feud within the controlling Porsche family, a convoluted takeover battle and a boardroom coup — has dominated the German media.  Ferdinand Piëch, who reigned over the supervisory board, stepped down as chairman in April after failing to oust Martin Winterkorn. In 2012, shareholders elected Mr. Piëch’s fourth wife to the board in spite of protests over her lack of qualifications and independence.  Shareholders have little influence. Porsche and Piëch family members own over half the voting shares and vote as a bloc. Labor representatives hold three of the five seats on the executive committee. Half the board seats are held by union officials and labor. The remaining seats are split between the government of Lower Saxoy, representatives of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, a few more members of the Piëch and Porsche families. A management representative holds another seat.  Outside views rarely penetrate.  The recent scandal seems sure to intensify pressure for change, but the German public is used to companies having this sort of corporate governance. But given the serious financial and reputational damage, the long-term survival of Volkswagen is a real question, Mr. Stewart writes.

 CURRENCY DROP ADDS TO BRAZIL’S WOES  |  The Brazilian currency has been synonymous with the country’s financial stability since it was created and a plunge in its value has hit Brazilian businesses already struggling with recession,  Vinod Sreeharsha reports in DealBook.  The real dropped to a record low against the dollar this week.  The weakness has delayed plans and deals, as well as freezing the market for initial public offerings. Brazilian companies that have dollar-denominated debt and are hit especially hard. Petrobras, the oil giant, could see its debt increase to 455.8 billion reais this quarter from 344.6 billion reais, solely because of currency fluctuations.  It is not the only emerging market economy watching its currency tumble as commodity prices slide and the dollar remains strong. But it is also plagued by political turmoil and is seen as the most vulnerable country in emerging markets.  On Tuesday, it broke the psychologically important level of 4 reais to the dollar for the first time. Some analysts think it has further to fall.  So far this year, the number of deals, 501, is only slightly fewer than the 505 announced over the same period last year, according to Dealogic. In terms of dollar volume, however, Brazil has had $27.71 billion in mergers and acquisitions this year, down from $41.97 billion over the same period last year. It is the country’s lowest volume at this point since 2005. For foreign investors, Brazil still has factors in its favor, including strong institutions and an independent judiciary, but the country’s fiscal woes are expected to linger for some time yet.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Japan Tobacco Said to Be in Talks for Reynolds Assets  |  Japan Tobacco is in talks to buy cigarette assets worth about $5 billion from Reynolds American as the company seeks to expand outside of its shrinking home market, Bloomberg News reports, citing people familiar with the talks.

113,The Benefits of Allowing Bitcoin to Flourish,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/business/dealbook/the-benefits-of-allowing-bitcoin-to-flourish.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-09-21T17:47:16+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," Technological innovations that make it easier and faster for people to interact directly have spurred some of the largest periods of economic growth in recent memory. Consumers have benefited greatly from new products and services that have lowered costs and made lives better. Email drastically sped up and increased communications between people. Ride-sharing services connect drivers to riders faster and more cheaply. Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, quickly connect students with professors across the country. The common thread between all of these tools is that they connect peers directly, while also providing entrepreneurs with the tools to control and improve their lives. Finance is not a place where innovation is always thought of as a good thing. In fact, after the financial crisis, the prevailing wisdom was that most financial innovations, like derivatives, were dangerous. In the last few years, however, Bitcoin has proved to be a financial platform that follows in the tradition of the Internet, empowering people to interact directly with each other, while providing a platform for entrepreneurs to innovate. For example, in the same way that simple message text protocol, or S.M.T.P., allows messages to be sent and received globally for a fraction of the cost of a stamp, Bitcoin allows for — among other things — value transfer to occur in the same seamless manner. Think of it as digital cash or the “email for money.” The positive impact of Bitcoin is most clear for international money transfers. Right now, it costs nearly 8 percent of the total amount sent to transfer money around the world, largely because of a complex web of third-party approvers. With Bitcoin and its public ledger, the costly middlemen are unnecessary. But this obvious benefit is only the beginning. Like the larger Internet on which it’s built, Bitcoin is a global and open system. Anyone with a computer and Internet connection can plug into the network and participate. That is where its most promising potential lies. As the Internet was allowed to flourish by limiting government’s hand on the underlying protocol and its development, so too should Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin sat at the fringes of the technology landscape as developers and users worked to improve its functionality and further its reach. Bitcoin start-ups and the larger digital currency ecosystem have gone mainstream, receiving major venture capital investments from the New York Stock Exchange, Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs and others. Nasdaq is experimenting with trading assets on the blockchain, and Citibank is reportedly developing its own in-house digital currency. Most recently, the N.Y.S.E. began a real-time price index that tracks the valuation of Bitcoin based on data provided by Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin platform at the forefront of the industry and the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the United States. Coinbase was specifically chosen by the exchange because of its commitments to transparency, security and regulatory compliance in the Bitcoin market. But like other areas, we have to strike the right balance between helpful rules that protect and sustain progress and those that will stifle innovation and economic growth. Indeed, platforms like Coinbase are already carrying out robust protections required by third parties like the N.Y.S.E., illustrating their commitment to consumer protection and security. Calls to impose burdensome regulations on Bitcoin wallet platforms in an effort to stamp out illicit uses would do almost nothing to solve the root problem. The only real result of such regulation would be to make it more difficult for the Bitcoin wallets to serve all of the legal participants who simply wish to take advantage of the technology’s ability to facilitate frictionless transactions between parties. Such an outcome would be tragic, especially given that the industry is poised for explosive growth. With a few million regular users, and a vast amount of untapped potential, Bitcoin is well positioned to lead a cultural shift that results in more globalized markets and new business models. It is essential that policy makers give careful consideration to a balanced approach when determining the most effective regulatory solutions for the platform. For example, government regulators should continue to focus on the connections between physical and digital currency and shun any attempts to force modification or regulation of the underlying protocol itself. Meaningful, light-touch rules that create necessary safeguards for users are a welcome addition to the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, but we must not inadvertently stifle the growth and innovation of the service we seek to regulate. When it comes to Bitcoin, we simply can’t afford it.",0.28698235294117647,0.10181099333672865

The cosmetics maker considered bringing in a private equity firm for what is known on Wall Street as a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, — essentially a negotiated stake sale by a publicly traded company. It has also explored other options. Bids are expected within the next few weeks.   The company fended off an unwanted takeover bid by a cosmetics rival, Coty, three years ago, but has failed to reverse nearly five years of falling sales and almost four years of losses. Its share price has tumbled nearly 87 percent during the last five years.   The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the discussions, noted that Avon’s business of selling door-to-door had struggled to keep up with changing shopper habits and it had been slow to increase sales via the Internet.   The company’s shares closed on Thursday at $4.10, valuing it at just under $2 billion. Avon still had about $696.9 million in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. But it carries about $2.2 billion in long-term debt and its bonds are rated at junk level with a negative outlook by Moody’s. 
 JUSTICE DEPT. PROMISE HARD TO KEEP  |  The Justice Department gave a directive this week essentially saying, “Banks don’t break the law, bankers do.” But recent investigations suggest that the challenges that prosecutors face cannot be easily solved by new rules, Ben Protess and Matt Apuzzo write in DealBook.   Prosecutors today would probably still struggle to indict Angelo Mozilo, the founder of Countrywide Financial, who embodied the risk-taking in subprime mortgages before the financial crisis. The same goes for Lehman Brothers executives who, like Mr. Mozilo, never faced criminal charges. Prosecutors conducted investigations of those executives along the lines of the new guidelines, but said that they struggled to prove wrongdoing.   “Updated guidelines are not a panacea,” said David A. O’Neil, a defense lawyer and the former acting head of the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington. “White-collar cases are hard to prove, because they’re very complex and if you don’t have direct evidence of fraud, there’s room for argument on both sides.”  Even when cases reach the courtrooms, they won’t necessarily success. In several Wall Street cases that involved individual charges, juries and judges have spoiled the government’s efforts to secure convictions and prison sentences.   The difficulties in proving wrongdoing in an increasingly complex financial system are compounded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s allocating more resources to fighting terrorism than white-collage crime. Justice Department and F.B.I. officials acknowledge that the shift has come at the expense of white-collar cases.   “I’m not trying to tell you that this means that tomorrow, all of a sudden, corporate heads are going to be rolling,” Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general and author of the new guidelines, said in an interview. “It’s going to take some time for these changes to take effect. And we don’t have any way of knowing what the actual impact will be in terms of cases that are brought.” 
 DEWEY CASE PROSECUTOR APPEALS TO COMMON SENSE  |  Lawyers for the three former Dewey & LeBoeuf executives on trial for cooking the books at the law firm spend three days picking holes in the prosecution’s case. They pointed out the unreliability of email evidence and the paucity of testimony from accounting experts. On Thursday, the prosecution hit back, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook.   Peirce Moser, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, appealed to jurors to use their common sense. He reminded them that the men were on trial not over the collapse of Dewey in May 2012, but on charges that they engineered a scheme to mislead lenders and creditors by concealing the once-prominent law firm’s ailing financial situation during the financial crisis.   He said the defendants — Steven Davis, Stephen DiCarmine and Joel Sanders — treated Dewey like an A.T.M. and kept the firm, which once employed 1,200 lawyers, propped up so they could continue to pay themselves multimillion-dollar salaries.   He even asked the jury to disregard testimony from witnesses that said they liked the defendants. Mr. DiCarmine, the law firm’s former executive director, might be an “awesome” person, as one witness called him, but that did not matter if he broke the law, Mr. Moser said. His appeal was an effort to counter strong closing arguments made by the defendants’ lawyers, who rested their case without calling any witnesses.   The financial crisis period has yielded no headline-grabbing cases of accounting fraud, so it is easy to imagine that the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., thought he had struck gold when this case came along, James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column.   One thing seems clear, Mr. Stewart writes. “Dewey & LeBoeuf is no Enron, and Mr. Davis, Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders are unlikely to emerge from the proceedings as household names synonymous with accounting fraud, no matter what the verdict.”  There’s no doubt that the accountants, with the encouragement of their bosses, were doing their best to make Dewey’s financial statements look as good as possible during a difficult period. But it still isn’t entirely clear they believed they were committing crimes: several testified that at the time, they didn’t believe they were doing anything wrong.  Furthermore, none of the adjustments were on the same scale as the financial falsehoods that dominated previous scandals like Enron. Much of the testimony was about arcane, small-bore accounting issues.   The prosecution may well add to a growing concern over what Justice Elena Kagan of the Supreme Court referred to as “overcriminalization and excessive punishment” when she discussed the  overzealous prosecution of trivial matters.   The Justice Departments initiative this week to begin holding corporate executives accountable was a response to widespread frustration that so few high-level executives have been prosecuted since the financial crisis even as their corporate employers have admitted wrongdoing and paid billions of dollars in fines. But that doesn’t mean prosecutors should bring cases based largely on inference and flimsy evidence, Mr. Stewart writes.

 ADVISER ON CHINESE REVERSE MERGERS CHARGED  |  The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Benjamin Wey, the founder of the Wall Street advisory firm New York Global Group, and charged him with of securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy and money laundering, Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.   This was the second time he had been before a judge in a federal court this year. In June, he was found liable of sexual harassment and defamation.   This time, he is accused of fraudulently taking Chinese companies public in the United States through reverse mergers — a process that involved buying the shell of an American company that had been publicly listed.   Prosecutors say Mr. Wey used family members to help build secret ownership positions in the companies and manipulate their share prices. The tens of millions generated from this went into bank accounts of relatives in places like Hong Kong and Switzerland, prosecutors said. Later, the money would be repatriated to the United States.   “Ben Wey fashioned himself a master of industry, but as alleged, he was merely a master of manipulation,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. David Siegal, Mr. Wey’s lawyer, wrote in an email, “Mr. Wey denies the charges against him and looks forward to clearing his name.”  In a separate civil complaint filed on Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. Wey and Seref Dogan Erbek, his Swiss banker, of fraud.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Telenor and TeliaSonera Call Off Merger of Danish Operations  |  The companies were unable to win approval from European antitrust authorities to combine their mobile telephone businesses.NYT »

115,Morning Agenda: Justice Department Sets Sights on Wall Street Executives,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/morning-agenda-justice-department-sets-sights-on-wall-street-executives/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-09-10T09:59:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SETS SIGHTS ON WALL STREET EXECUTIVES  |  After years of criticism that it has coddled Wall Street criminals, the Justice Department has prioritized the prosecution of individual employees and not just their companies, Matt Apuzzo and Ben Protess report in The New York Times.   The department issued new rules in a memo telling civil and criminal investigators to change their focus. The new rules also put pressure on corporations to turn over evidence against their executives. Companies will not be able to obtain credit for cooperating with the government unless they identify employees and give up evidence. Credit for cooperation can save companies billions of dollars in fines and decide whether they end up with a civil settlement or a criminal charge.   “Corporations can only commit crimes through flesh-and-blood people,” Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in an interview on Wednesday.”It’s only fair that the people who are responsible for committing those crimes be held accountable. The public needs to have confidence that there is one system of justice and it applies equally regardless of whether that crime occurs on a street corner or in a boardroom.”  The first major policy announcement by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch since she took office in April acknowledges that the Justice Department under President Obama has punished few executives involved in the housing crisis, the financial meltdown and corporate scandals.   The Justice Department often takes aim at companies first, then turns to individuals after negotiating a corporate settlement. In many cases, the offending employees go unpunished. The rules could erase barriers to prosecuting corporate employees and inject new life into high-profile investigations.   The new rules take effect immediately, but they are not likely to apply to investigations that are far along, like one into General Motors over defects. Prosecutors in New York are struggling to charge the employees over problems linked to the deaths of more than 100 people, partly because the laws governing car companies require that prosecutors show that the employees intended to break the law.  The move is merely symbolic in some respects, Mr. Apuzzo and Mr. Protess note. The memo lays out guidelines, not laws, and its effect will be determined by how officials interpret it. Some of the points made merely codify policy that is already in place.   It is unknown whether the rules will encourage companies to turn in their executives, but Ms. Yates said the Justice Department would not allow companies to foist the blame onto low-level officials.   Even if the Justice Department’s effort is successful, it would not automatically put more executives behind bars. Brandon L. Garrett, a University of Virginia law professor, analyzed the cases in which corporate employees had been charged. More than half, he said, were spared jail time. 
 DISRUPTING BLOOMBERG  |  Bloomberg L.P. has become a target for competitors at a time when Wall Street is looking to cut spending on its terminals, Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook.   Bloomberg has been a difficult target for challengers because of its wide range of offerings, from market data to trading platforms. Many traders view their Bloomberg terminal as their most powerful and important tool, and speak of the terminals with an almost emotional fondness.   Symphony, a start-up created by Goldman Sachs and backed by the large banks, is introducing software that provides an alternative to the Bloomberg chat program, which many traders say is the most valuable part of the terminal. At Goldman, more than half of the people who have Bloomberg terminals use them primarily for chat and other simple functions, according to people briefed on the subject who were not authorized to speak publicly.   Being backed by 14 financial firms gives Symphony an advantage that previous competitors did not have. The thinking in the industry is that if Symphony catches on, it could allow companies to cancel many Bloomberg subscriptions. Bloomberg has never been willing to sell its chat program separately from the rest of the terminal.   Another start-up, Money.Net, built by a former Bloomberg executive, is challenging Bloomberg head-on and stealing customers. David G. Bullock, a former Lehman Brothers executive who runs his own financial advisory firm, signed up for Money.Net last year and cancelled his Bloomberg terminal. His banker friends have taken an interest when he mentions the service, particularly when he explains that it costs one-twentieth what Bloomberg charges for a terminal.   Mr. Bullock said Bloomberg had long been the subject of complaints among his colleagues about its unwillingness to negotiate on the price of terminals.   Morgan Downey, the man behind Money.Net, said he left Bloomberg to create a lowcost challenger after seeing how slowly Bloomberg was changing and how many of the company’s clients wanted a cheaper alternative. “The market has Stockholm syndrome in thinking this should cost $25,000 a year,” Mr. Downey said. “Bloomberg has big profits and a lot of waste.”   Mr. Downey said banks’ efforts to find alternatives to Bloomberg became more active in 2013 after Bloomberg was accused of allowing its journalists to snoop on the personal details of customers.   Bloomberg is not the only vulnerable service provider on Wall Street at the moment. The  financial industry is cutting costs aggressively as it grapples with new regulations and changes in the markets. A Bloomberg contract, which can be upward of $100 million at larger institutions, is a tempting target.   The number of Bloomberg terminals grew only 1.9 percent, to 325,000, last year. In the 10 years before the financial crisis, the number of terminals grew at an average rate of 12 percent each year, with most companies signing on for multiyear contracts.  Bloomberg has fended off competition before and it has cash reservoirs to help it, but its own history shows how difficult it is to maintain its dominant market position. Bloomberg rose to prominence in the 1990s by replacing data companies like Quotron and Telerate that failed to change quickly enough to protect their market share.   Hamza Khan, the 28-year-old head of commodities strategy at ING Bank in Amsterdam, said that even if Bloomberg’s competitors didn’t succeed, its terminals were losing their allure. “They are like Grandpa Simpson: They used to be with it, but then it changed,” Mr. Khan said.

 PUERTO RICO’S 5-YEAR PLAN  |  The governor of Puerto Rico has announced a plan to bail the island out of debt that would require at least five years of bruising reform if it is to succeed, Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook.   The governor, Alejandro García Padilla, stepped up his populist talk, trying to take the side of residents who would face losses on their Puerto Rico bonds if the plan went into effect. “We may be publicly attacked by outside interests who will want to force us to pay,” Mr. García Padilla said. “They will attack us, because they’ll want to see us on our knees.”   He tried simultaneously to show the island’s creditors that they would be better off working with him than fighting his proposals. Unilateral action, he said, “will result in years of litigation and defaults, and a major humanitarian crisis. It will force us to choose between paying a creditor, a teacher, a policeman or a nurse.”   The plan calls for a restructuring of about $47 billion of Puerto Rico’s $72 billion in total bond debt. Creditors would voluntarily accept reduced payments. It also includes an ambitious package of economic reforms designed to deliver public services, collect taxes more efficiently, stimulate business investment, create jobs, and carry out overdue maintenance on infrastructure.   Virtually every element of the plan requires either concessions negotiated from creditors or legislation enacted in San Juan or Washington, suggesting a long and difficult road ahead.  “There is a high probability of protracted litigation,” said Ted Hampton, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, “It is unlikely that holders of the many Puerto Rico bonds will agree to forgo, or defer, substantial sums of promised principal and interest.”  Puerto Rico’s proposal to restructure its debt, including its general obligation bonds, is challenging decades of precedent and investor expectations of the municipal bond market, Michael Corkery explains in DealBook. General obligation debt typically carries a government’s highest pledge to repay investors. In Puerto Rico, the payments are guaranteed by the island’s constitution. The restructuring proposal indicates that when a local government is stretched to breaking point, no pledge is sacrosanct.  The vast majority of cities and states in the United States are in stable fiscal condition and have ready access to the municipal debt market. But if the economy soured and struggling municipalities encountered budget problems, investors might reconsider lending them money in light of the way Puerto Rico has treated them.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Charles S.

116,Morning Agenda: David Einhorn Surveys Investors,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/morning-agenda-david-einhorn-surveys-investors/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-09-01T11:15:25+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"DAVID EINHORN SURVEYS INVESTORS  |  David Einhorn has a reputation as one of the savviest stock pickers on Wall Street, but even he has not been spared in the recent market turmoil. This year is shaping up to be one of  the worst in the history of his hedge fund. People briefed on the matter say the Greenlight Capital fund was down 5.3 percent in August and down 14 percent for the year. And Mr. Einhorn has been trying to find out what his investors think about the fund,  Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook. This year, Mr. Einhorn’s firm had retained an outside consulting firm to  conduct a survey of investors, according to people briefed on the matter. The firm started contacting Greenlight’s investors several weeks ago to conduct phone interviews, and gauge their thoughts about the hedge fund and its accessibility.  It is not clear what Mr. Einhorn intends to do with the results. He has conducted surveys from time to time before and a person briefed on the matter said the timing of the survey had nothing to do with the fund’s recent performance. Still, it is a sign of how hedge fund managers, even famous ones like Mr. Einhorn,  need to be sensitive to their investors.  Mr. Einhorn said in July that his investment in SunEdison was the “only significant winner,” but even its stock took a sharp dive in August. Along with gold, General Motors and Apple rank among his biggest long positions and both have had  uneven returns in recent months.  Some investors speculate that Mr. Einhorn might be managing too much money and  his firm is not as nimble as it once was, making it more difficult to exit losing positions. The poor results come after Mr. Einhorn opened the doors of his firm to new investors, raising money for the first time in years.  Other investors are willing to give Mr. Einhorn the benefit of the doubt, noting that the firm has generated an  annualized return of just over 19 percent since it opened for business  in 1996. August was also a torrid month for other hedge funds.   In his most recent note to investors, Mr. Einhorn made an  appeal to investors to sit tight, signing off with a quote from the inventor Thomas A. Edison. “A diamond is a piece of coal that stuck to the job,” Mr. Einhorn wrote. 
 DREAMERS AND THE DEFIANT  |  This relentless summer of business news has left little time for other reading, but if you have time in what is left of it, Andrew Ross Sorkin has a list of the best business books this year. “I’m obsessed with business books, especially ones that provide insight into the people behind the companies and inventions that drive the global economy,” Mr. Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.   Top of the list is Ashlee Vance’s “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.” Questions may remain about the sustainability of Mr. Musk’s business, but this biography gives a glimpse of what keeps the 44-year-old South African dreamer going. It is also reveals that he had a difficult childhood with an abusive father. Says a schoolmate of Mr. Musk: “Honestly, there were just no signs that he was going to be a billionaire.”  Mr. Sorkin also recommends, “The Richest Man Who Ever Lived: The Life and Times of Jacob Fugger,” by Greg Steinmetz. Jacob Fugger, a German banker in the 15th century, “could have been a Russian oligarch, a Latin American telecoms boss or an American railroad baron from the 19th century,” Mr. Steinmetz says. The grandson of a peasant, Mr. Fugger cornered the copper market in Europe and then became one of the world’s most influential bankers, counting even the pope as a client.   If you’re aiming to create your own billion-dollar start-up, or you just want to understand Silicon Valley, Mr. Sorkin recommends Peter Thiel’s “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.” One of the venture capitalist’s rules is to never invest in a company that pays its C.E.O. more than $150,000. He thinks a “cash-poor” executive will be hungrier to create value and it sets a good example to the rest of the company.   Mr. Sorkin’s other recommendation range from an examination of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to a look about the transformation of the television industry, to a book on the financial machinations behind modern baseball. He also recommends Nathaniel Popper’s fly-on-the-wall narrative of Bitcoin’s origins and the memoir of Bill Browder, an early hedge-fund investor in Russia, which reads like a John Grisham thriller.   All of these books, Mr. Sorkin says, give readers an understanding of the human drama behind every business saga.

 CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON ‘SPREADING RUMORS’  |  The Chinese Ministry of Public Security announced that it had punished at least 197 people in recent days for “spreading rumors” online, Edward Wong reports in The New York Times. The so-called rumors related to uncertainty in China’s stock market, the explosion in Tianjin and the parade scheduled for Thursday to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that the ministry’s actions were the core of a “special campaign” by the police.  One of the most prominent targets of the recent campaign was Wang Xiaolu, a reporter for a respected business magazine, Caijing. He was compelled to make a confession on television in which he said he had written a “sensational” and “irresponsible” article on the stock market. Chinese authorities have increasingly used confessions on the state network to humiliate detainees and to use as a warning for others.   Mr. Wang wrote an article published on July 20, reporting that the China Securities Regulatory Commission was seeking to withdraw funds from the stock market. He was detained by police on Aug. 25. Caijing issued a statement saying it did not know why he had been detained. Xinhua said his report had caused “abnormal fluctuations” in the stock market.  Along with Mr. Wang, several financial officials and executives were detained last week for contributing to stock market volatility and have been dealt with by “criminal compulsory measures,” according to Xinhua. Those detained include Liu Shufan, an official with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and four executives from Citic Securities Company, the country’s leading securities dealer.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Prospective Buyers of GE Capital Reportedly Narrowed Down to 3  |  Sankaty Advisors, Lone Star and HNA Group are said to be the final participants in an auction of the Australian commercial lending and leasing businesses of GE Capital.NYT »

117,Bitcoin Technology Piques Interest on Wall St.,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/business/dealbook/bitcoin-technology-piques-interest-on-wall-st.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-08-28T18:53:47+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Most people still think of Bitcoin as the virtual currency used by drug dealers and shadowy hackers looking to evade the authorities. But the innovations that helped turn Bitcoin into the most popular virtual currency are now being viewed as a potentially enormous disruptive force for several industries, including accounting, music and law.  Nowhere, though, are more money and resources being spent on the technology than on Wall Street — the very industry that Bitcoin was created to circumvent. “There is so much pull and interest on this right now,” said Derek White, the chief digital officer at Barclays, the British global bank, which has a team of employees working on about 20 experiments that explore how the technology underlying Bitcoin might change finance. “That comes from a recognition that, ‘Wow, we can use this to change the fundamental model of how we operate to create our future.’” For people like Mr. White, Bitcoin isn’t just a digital token to use for online purchases. Instead, many of the top minds in finance have come to believe that the software that brought the virtual currency into existence also enables a fundamentally new way of transacting and maintaining records online — allowing people and banks to directly exchange money and assets like stocks and bonds without having to rely on a long chain of expensive middlemen. A few banks have gone public with their work, but most of the activity has been happening behind the scenes. At one private meeting, held in April at one of the Manhattan offices of Bank of America, executives from more than a dozen large banks gathered to confidentially discuss how the technology underlying Bitcoin could be used to change foreign currency trading, the largest financial market in the world, according to people who attended the meeting. Central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have their own teams looking at the technology. “A year ago, it was more of an idea,” said Max Neukirchen, the head of corporate strategy at JPMorgan Chase. “Now, it is a real opportunity. You test it and realize that this can play a big role in our thinking about how our own infrastructure will evolve.” This is a long way from the derision that many bankers — including JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon — expressed when Bitcoin burst into the public consciousness in 2013, when the price of a Bitcoin was bouncing around wildly in a speculative frenzy that was often compared to the Dutch tulip bulb mania. At the time, some large companies like Dell and Overstock announced that they would start taking Bitcoins for online purchases, but few consumers showed much interest in using the digital money to pay their bills, and the furor around Bitcoin largely died down. The institutions that are now becoming involved are generally not interested in selling goods for Bitcoins or owning the virtual currency. They are, instead, looking at the network and software that make it possible for Bitcoin to move around the world instantly, and almost free. Until now, digital transactions have always gone through some sort of central authority that can move the money and update the records on both sides — as PayPal and Visa do for many online purchases. The Bitcoin network, on the other hand, is run by a decentralized network of users who jointly keep track of transactions and update the records in real time, with no single user or company in charge. The records of all transactions are kept on a public ledger — essentially just a big, publicly available spreadsheet — known as the blockchain that is visible to anyone and has, at least so far, proven impossible to tamper with. Much of the work being done inside banks, and in other industries, is looking at whether the blockchain technology can be used independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which was the first thing to be recorded on the blockchain ledger. The music publication Billboard recently wrote about how several start-ups are aiming to use a digital ledger like the blockchain to keep track of musical downloads and distribute the royalties to artists without relying on a central record keeper. Vermont’s state government commissioned a study in June to look at how a blockchain could be used as a legal method of record keeping under state law; it is one of several governments, many of them outside the United States, looking at the technology. But the most intense work is being done by financial companies like the Nasdaq OMX Group, which has several programmers in Manhattan preparing software that the company plans to roll out this year. The Nasdaq software will allow the trading of stocks in private companies, like tech start-ups, on a new kind of blockchain. This will replace the existing system in which private companies issue and trade shares using paper certificates — a process that means that even basic trades can take weeks to complete. Beyond the immediate trial, Nasdaq is experimenting with several other markets in which blockchain-like ledgers could be used to make trading faster and cheaper. The work is being overseen by Fredrik Voss, who recently shifted from his work in the company’s commodity division to become its top blockchain executive. “We believe that blockchain technology holds great promise in allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently while simultaneously providing greater transparency and security, all of which are fundamental to the public interest,” Nasdaq’s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, said in a July call with investors. Financial firms first began talking publicly about Bitcoin in late 2013. Back then, though, most of the attention was negative, focused on the speculative aspect of the virtual currency. More recently, banks like Goldman Sachs, Santander and BBVA have made their first investments in outside start-ups working on Bitcoin technology, several of which were started by former employees at big banks. But the banks have generally been less public about the work they have been doing internally with their own employees. At Citigroup, for instance, there are six different in-house experiments, building software that harnesses the blockchain technology, according to people briefed on the company’s work. In one test, the bank has created its own virtual currency, Citicoin, that employees can experiment with. Aside from Nasdaq’s project, there is much debate about where the technology is likely to gain its first real world use. At Barclays, some of the 20 internal experiments — most of them conducted at two Barclays offices in London dedicated to the technology — are looking at ways to use the blockchain to speed up and lower the cost of consumer payments, to compete with credit cards and direct money transfers. But bankers generally say that most of the work is aimed at changing the systems that big Wall Street traders and investors use to buy and sell sophisticated assets like syndicated loans and corporate bonds. Because any innovation in this area would require the cooperation of multiple banks, the banks have had joint meetings to discuss how they could work together, often led by outside start-ups looking to provide the software. One of the most advanced of those conversations has been coordinated by a start-up known as R3Cev that is led by a former Wall Street executive, David E. Rutter. R3Cev has put together models for how banks could trade foreign currencies on a communally maintained spreadsheet like the blockchain, according to people briefed on the project. It was R3Cev that convened the April meeting at Bank of America, which was attended by more than 75 people from 15 financial institutions, these people said. This can seem like rather esoteric business, but these are the markets where huge amounts of money turn over each day, and these markets influence the profits of the largest financial institutions. For instance, more than $3 trillion changes hands each day on the foreign currency market. For many bankers, the question is not if the technology is put to use but when. Mr. Neukirchen, at JPMorgan, is one of many bankers who expect that it will take a few years for the first significant use of blockchain technology to gain traction. Mr. White at Barclays expects it even sooner, in the next year. The prospect of banks capitalizing on the technology can be disappointing to early Bitcoin adherents, many of whom were drawn to the technology because it provided a way to move and store money that did not rely on banks. Many in the financial industry hope they can find a way to use the blockchain concept — what is often referred to as a distributed ledger — without using the blockchain associated with Bitcoin. Although the bankers working on the idea disagree on how this will happen, they show surprisingly little disagreement on whether it will happen. One of Goldman’s top Internet analysts, Heath Terry, said in a recent company podcast that “the whole blockchain tech behind Bitcoin has massive implications for really any kind of asset — and the ability to transfer ownership of digital goods.” “It’s hard to see a world where that blockchain technology doesn’t end up changing the way we think about asset ownership,” he said.",0.21815660377358492,0.1359847123526369

The buyback bug, which has bitten big companies from Apple to General Electric, has led to a backlash from investors and government officials. They doubt that using profits like that is a productive way to deploy capital compared with reinvesting in businesses and jobs.   Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Tammy Baldwin have made explosive claims that buybacks might be a form of market manipulation. Both senators have urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the practice. “These buybacks were treated as stock manipulation for decades because that is exactly what they are,” Ms. Warren said.   Hillary Rodham Clinton also got the attention of industry in a speech when she said, “Investors and regulators alike need more information about these transactions. Capital markets work best when information is promptly and widely available to all.” She pointed out that in places like Britain and Hong Kong, stock buybacks have to be disclosed in one day, whereas in the United States, companies can go an entire quarter without disclosing.   Mr. Sorkin notes that if the disclosure rule were changed, it would probably  make it tougher and more expensive  for American companies to buy back shares.   The surge in buybacks followed a provision that gave companies so-called safe harbor against charges of manipulation if they bought their stock in the open market under certain circumstances. Buybacks are considered shareholder friendly, and tax efficient because there is no tax to be immediately paid, unlike a dividend.  But they also benefit executives seeking to lift their pay. Buybacks allow companies to issue more stock to executives without diluting other shareholders.   Another point of contention is that buybacks increase earnings per share, a metric that some compensation committees use to determine the pay of their executives. On top of that, it also increases stock price in the short term regardless of operational success, potentially letting executives cash out of some of their shares at artificially high prices.   Although buybacks can have their drawbacks, it is hard to tell a company how it can or cannot spend its money, Mr. Sorkin writes. “Ultimately, the pressure for companies to invest in their operations and new jobs is only going to come when managements see a real business opportunity — and shareholders demand it.” 
 MAN CHARGED WITH BITCOIN SCHEME IN COURT  |  Anthony Murgio, a Florida man, was charged with running an illegal bitcoin money exchange company and is thought to have information about the hacking attack last summer against JPMorgan Chase. He said nothing when he appeared in court, letting his lawyer do the talking, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook.   Mr. Murgio remains free on $100,000 bail, which was posted a week ago. He was arrested on July 21 in Tampa and spent a few nights in the Pinellas County jail while he and his family secured the money.   Federal authorities contend that his company, Coin.mx, allowed online criminals to illegally exchange bitcoin for cash as part of a money-laundering scheme. Mr. Murgio could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if convicted. His partner in the company, Yuri Lebedev, faces a similar charge and is free on $25,000 bail.   Neither has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the hacking at JPMorgan. But federal authorities want to know what information Mr. Murgio may have about the attack, as his name surfaced early in the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people briefed on the investigation have said.  One of his friends, Joshua Aaron, also came to the attention of the F.B.I. He has been charged with operating a series of schemes to pump up the prices of otherwise worthless stocks. Authorities have declined to discuss what led them to think Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron might have information about the JPMorgan attack. People briefed on the matter said that Mr. Aaron might have used information gathered in the breach, like purloined email addresses and customer home addresses, to put together a list of potential victims to pitch stocks.   They both visited Russia in the last few years. The authorities suspect the actual hackers may be in Russia or another European country. 
 WARREN BUFFETT BUCKS THE TREND  |  When Berkshire Hathaway first invested in Precision Castparts three years ago, Warren Buffett had hardly heard of the metal parts manufacturer. Now he has bought the company in his biggest takeover ever. The $32 billion purchase will help Berkshire Hathaway move further into the industrial sector, Michael J. de la Merced and Chad Bray write in DealBook. It is also betting that Precision Castparts, whose turbine airfoils and valves are used by companies like Boeing and Airbus, will benefit from growing numbers in airline travel.  Berkshire Hathaway is generally expected to strike huge deals — the company generates an enormous amount of cash and is sitting on nearly $67 billion as of June 30.   Although the acquisition fits Mr. Buffett’s mold, it also  coincides with cyclical highs  in plane orders, stock valuations, and mergers and acquisitions, Antony Currie writes in Breakingviews.   Mr. Currie notes that Precision Castparts’ shares have tumbled 40 percent since their peak in June of last year — just the sort of opportunity Mr. Buffett is known to relish.  Although aircraft orders have increased, it is not clear that this pace of growth can be sustained, and a minority of analysts published by Reuters have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. This makes the deal a  rather contrarian investment, Mr. Currie notes. 
 THE F.D.A. AND THE FREE-SPEECH FIGHT  |  The Food and Drug Administration takes the position that when it approves a drug for a particular treatment, the manufacturer of that drug cannot promote it for other uses even if those statements are true. That policy has been called into question in a decision by Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, who found that the First Amendment protects drug companies that want to make truthful statements about their drugs, even if it is for an unapproved use, Peter J. Henning writes in the White Collar Watch column. This sets up a likely appeal to determine just how far the government can go to punish speech that is truthful.  Amarin Pharma, a small drug manufacturer, challenged the F.D.A. when it wanted to promote the off-label use of its cardiovascular health drug, Vascepa, for patients with a different condition. An F.D.A.-approved study showed that the use of the drug was effective, but the agency denied approval for use by those patients.  The company and four doctors sued the F.D.A. after it threatened to bring civil charges against them if they used the study to help sell off-label use of Vascepa. They claim that the agency’s rule violates their First Amendment right to free speech, asking the district court to block enforcement. Judge Engelmayer sided with the company.   Mr. Henning notes that the decision is “not a license for pharmaceutical manufacturers to start bombarding doctors with promotional materials for new uses of their products. They need to be careful to stay well within the requirement that any statements be truthful and not misleading, lest they cross the line into fraud. As long as they do, then the type of blockbuster settlements for off-label promotions may be a thing of the past.”

 MALLINCKRODT TO ACQUIRE THERAKOS  |  Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs and medical devices, said that it had agreed to buy Therakos from the American private equity firm Gores Group for about $1.33 billion, Chad Bray reports in DealBook. The purchase of Therakos, which makes immunotherapy treatment devices, is expected to  broaden Mallinckrodt’s specialty segment and to expand its business in hospitals. This would give it a larger presence in the market for pain management and critical-care respiratory therapies in neonatal intensive care units. It is also the latest in a  deal-making binge  by Mallinckrodt, which last year acquired  Cadence, a biopharmaceutical company in San Diego, for $1.3 billion and bought Questcor Pharmaceuticals for $5.6 billion. It also acquired Ikaria, a maker of treatments for critically ill infants, for $2.3 billion in March. Mallinckrodt is under pressure because the growth of its biggest product, HP Acthar Gel, seems to be slowing, only a year after Mallinckrodt obtained the ultraexpensive, immune-modulating drug. Its shares fell last week after the company  lowered sales expectations for Acthar in announcing quarterly earnings.    |  Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  Terex Corporation and Konecranes of Finland Agree to Merge  |  The combined company would be a big supplier of cranes and heavy equipment, with estimated revenue of about $10 billion a year.NYT »

119,Man Charged in Bitcoin Scheme Appears in New York Court,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/business/man-charged-in-bitcoin-scheme-appears-in-new-york-court.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-08-10T22:23:40+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Anthony Murgio, a Florida man who was charged last month by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with running an illegal bitcoin money exchange firm and is thought to have information about last summer’s hacking attack against JPMorgan Chase, seemed to be taking the unfolding criminal case against him in stride during a court appearance on Monday morning. Mr. Murgio, 31, made small talk with the two federal agents in the hallway of the federal court in Lower Manhattan, while waiting to appear on those charges before the United States magistrate judge, James C. Francis IV. At one point, he even rushed to see if a woman who had fallen in the hallway was hurt and needed help getting up. But when he appeared in court, Mr. Murgio said nothing, letting his lawyer, Gregory W. Kehoe of the big law firm Greenberg Traurig, do the talking. The hearing was brief and the judge allowed Mr. Murgio, who has run a number of less-than-successful businesses since graduating from Florida State University, to remain free on $100,000 bail. Mr. Murgio posted the bail a week ago after his arrest on July 21 in Tampa after spending a few nights in the Pinellas County jail while he and his family secured the money. Both Mr. Murgio and his lawyer declined to comment after the proceeding in federal court. Federal authorities contend that Mr. Murgio’s company, Coin.mx, allowed online criminals to illegally exchange the digital currency bitcoin for cash as part of a money-laundering scheme. Mr. Murgio could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the money-laundering charges. The judge, at the request of Eun Young Choi, a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, ordered Mr. Murgio not to talk to anyone associated with his company and not to work for any other money-transfer firm. Mr. Murgio’s partner in running the small bitcoin firm, Yuri Lebedev, who also lives in Florida and was similarly charged by prosecutors, is out on $25,000 bail. Neither man has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the hacking at JPMorgan that compromised the personal contact information of 83 million customer accounts at the bank. But federal authorities are particularly interested in what Mr. Murgio may know about the attack, as his name surfaced early in the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people briefed on the investigation have said. Joshua Aaron, a friend of Mr. Murgio and one of his college classmates from Florida State, also came to the attention of the F.B.I. early on. Mr. Aaron was one of three men charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with operating a series of schemes to pump up the prices of otherwise worthless stocks who also is said to have some link to the JPMorgan attack. Two of those men were arrested in Israel on the day that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev were arrested in Florida. Mr. Aaron, who moved to Israel several years ago, could not be arrested at his home in Tel Aviv because he was out of the country. Mr. Aaron, 31, is thought to be staying in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen, based on social media posts from several weeks ago. The authorities have not formally declared him a fugitive, but people briefed on the matter said it was being considered. On Monday, the two men arrested in Israel, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, appeared in a Jerusalem court and were ordered by a judge to remain in custody until at least Sept. 1. Both men have been detained by Israeli authorities at the request of federal prosecutors since their arrest on July 21. Lawyers for Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein had asked for the men to be released from prison and confined to home arrest. Israeli prosecutors had wanted both men held for an additional 40 days. Federal prosecutors are beginning to seek to extradite Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein to New York. But the process could take months. As with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev, neither Mr. Aaron nor his associates in Israel are facing any charges arising out of apparent theft of information from JPMorgan. The authorities have declined to discuss what led them to conclude Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron might have some information about the JPMorgan attack. People briefed on the matter said that Mr. Aaron might have used information gathered in the breach, like purloined email addresses and customer home addresses, to put together a list of potential victims to pitch the stocks for their various schemes. People familiar with stock manipulation schemes said a high-quality list of email addresses — like the customer contact information taken from JPMorgan — could sell for several million dollars on the black market. Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron were known to have visited Russia in the last few years. The authorities suspect the actual hackers may be in Russia or another European country. Federal authorities are under some pressure to develop information that could lead to the filing of charges related to the breach, especially against Mr. Aaron, Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein, now that charges have been filed against them with regards to the stock manipulation. Legal experts said once a defendant was extradited from a foreign country it was difficult to file new charges against that person, especially if the charges arose from a different offense. The time constraint facing authorities then would seem to give leverage to anyone charged in either case but willing to take a plea and provide evidence linking the crimes to the attack.",-0.12234927536231884,-0.016301419997072172
120,A Cryptocurrency Millionaire Wants to Build a Utopia in Nevada,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/nevada-bitcoin-blockchain-society.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-11-01T19:30:06+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"STOREY COUNTY, Nev. — An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert — bigger than nearby Reno — has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year. The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery. He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin. After his driver stopped the Polaris on a high desert plateau, surrounded by blooming rabbit brush and a grazing herd of wild horses, Mr. Berns, who is 56, pointed to the highlights of his dream community. “You see that first range of mountains,” he said, pointing south. “Those mountains are the border of our South Valley. That’s where we’re going to build the high-tech park,” a research campus that would cover hundreds of acres. There are also plans for a college and an e-gaming arena. As strange — even fantastical — as all this might sound, Mr. Berns’s ambitions fit right into the idiosyncratic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. The blockchain began as a digital ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some aficionados have grander plans. They think it could be a new way of taking power back from the institutions they believe are calling all the shots. Just as Bitcoin made it possible to transfer money without using a bank, blockchain believers like Mr. Berns think the technology will make it possible for ordinary people to control their own data — the lifeblood of the digital economy — without relying on big companies or governments. There is a fuzzy line between these utopian visions and get-rich-quick schemes. Several cryptocurrency projects have been shut down by regulators; apparent hucksters have been arrested; and a plan to transform Puerto Rico with cryptocurrencies has been criticized as nothing more than a bid to take advantage of the island’s status as a tax haven. Mr. Berns was drawn to Nevada by its tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. And the breadth of his ambitions certainly raises the risk of a boondoggle. But he is different from his crypto-brethren in one big way: He is spending his own money. So far, he said, he has spent $300 million on the land, offices, planning and a staff of 70 people. And buying 67,000 largely undeveloped acres is a bit of old-fashioned, real estate risk-taking. Still, Mr. Berns said his ambition was not to be a real estate magnate or even to get rich — or richer. He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a “distributed collaborative entity,” is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone’s ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet. Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn’t discouraged him. “I don’t know why,” he said over the roar of the Polaris engine. “I just — something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.” Mr. Berns has managed to win over local officials who are eager for economic development. Nevada’s governor, Brian Sandoval, read a proclamation that named the Blockchains property “Innovation Park” at an event last month where Mr. Berns sat on a panel with the governor and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, which has been described as the largest building in the world, is surrounded by Blockchains’ land. Companies like Google, Apple and Switch also have properties in the industrial park that is surrounded by Mr. Berns’s holdings. This week, he announced a memorandum of understanding with one of the state’s main power companies, NV Energy, to team up on projects that will run energy transactions through a blockchain. The Nevada county where this is all located, Storey County, has only about 4,000 residents and was best known, until recently, for its history of silver mining and its modern brothels, including one owned by a county commissioner. That same county commissioner, Lance Gilman, bought the land surrounding the brothel and turned it into the industrial park where Tesla and Google are now located. Blockchains has already received preliminary county support for a new town along the Truckee River, with thousands of homes, a school and a drone delivery system, and is working closely with the county on a broader master plan. But for now, Blockchains is empty land and a repurposed office building. Mr. Berns said the company won’t begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county. The office manager from Mr. Berns’s old law office in Los Angeles, Joanna Rodriguez, moved with her four children and husband to Nevada. “He has these crazy ideas — but I know that every time he sets his mind to something he will get there,” said Ms. Rodriguez, 29, who has worked with Mr. Berns for eight years and is now the manager of the Blockchains office in Nevada. “That’s why I decided to move.” Mr. Berns spent most of his professional life on class-action lawsuits, many of them against financial companies. He learned about Bitcoin in 2012 but was won over by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which makes it possible to store more than just transaction data on a blockchain. Mr. Berns bought Ether, the digital token associated with Ethereum, in a big sale in 2015. Thanks to an astronomical increase in the price of Ether and some well-timed selling last year before it crashed, he became wealthy enough to fund his dream project. Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data. Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved. That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic. Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet. He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people’s private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. He has already purchased vaults that are burrowed into mountains in Sweden and Switzerland, and he plans to build additional vaults in the mountains in Nevada. The other thing holding back Ethereum, Mr. Berns believes, has been a lack of real-world laboratories. His Nevada land, he hopes, will change that. “This will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,” Mr. Berns said. “I don’t know which one. I believe it’s the former, but either way it’s going to be one hell of a ride.”",0.07398607594936708,0.05469911593329315

Gox, the exchange that served as the largest hub for storing and trading the virtual currency Bitcoin, law enforcement officials and angry clients have been asking what happened to nearly half a billion dollars in Bitcoins that the company said had vanished from its computer systems. On Saturday, the Japanese police arrested Mark Karpeles, the head of the exchange, which was based in Tokyo, on suspicion that he had used the popular online financial platform, which he developed, to illicitly add $1 million to an account under his control. But the arrest, and the small amount of information divulged by Japanese law enforcement officials, shed little light on the larger mystery of the missing Bitcoins. Television news video showed officers from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department leading Mr. Karpeles, a 30-year-old French national, from his apartment early Saturday morning. In a statement, the police said they believed that Mr. Karpeles had “unjustly inflated the balance” of an account held under his name by manipulating transaction records on a system that Mt. Gox used to swap Bitcoins for dollars. “He created false information that $1 million had been transferred into the account, when in fact it had not been,” the police said in a short statement. The implosion of Mt. Gox, which Mr. Karpeles nurtured from humble beginnings as a platform for trading collectible cards from the game Magic: The Gathering, shook the still-developing world of virtual currencies. The sophisticated encryption that makes it possible to use Bitcoin conveniently and anonymously did not, the episode seemed to show, necessarily protect it against theft or security lapses at one’s virtual bank. Before it filed for bankruptcy in February of last year, Mt. Gox said 850,000 Bitcoins, mostly belonging to its clients, had been either lost or stolen by hackers, an amount worth more than $450 million at the time. The company also said it had lost $27 million in cash. Mt. Gox later said it had recovered 200,000 of the missing Bitcoins from an overlooked part of its computer systems. With its accounting in disarray, however, it said it could not be sure what had happened to the rest, or even verify exactly how many Bitcoins it had actually held to begin with. Mr. Karpeles has apologized for “weaknesses in the system” but denied that he had taken any of his clients’ assets. On Friday night, in response to reports in the Japanese news media that he would soon be arrested, he sent instant messages to The Wall Street Journal saying the accusations made by the police were “false” and that he would “of course deny” them, The Journal reported. Lawyers at an international law firm that has represented Mr. Karpeles did not respond to calls seeking comment. Mr. Karpeles has not been formally charged. The Japanese authorities can hold suspects for several weeks before deciding whether to bring charges. The police did not say where they thought the $1 million that they claimed was falsely shown in Mr. Karpeles’s account had come from or what he intended to do with it. After the exchange’s collapse, former employees came forward to accuse Mr. Karpeles of dipping into clients’ accounts to cover the exchange’s operating costs. The practice, they said, was common at Mt. Gox well before the mass disappearance of Bitcoins that ultimately sank it. The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s largest newspaper, citing unnamed police sources, said the money was suspected to have been siphoned from accounts held by Mt. Gox users. In any case, the amount cited by the police represents only a tiny fraction of the value of the Bitcoins that went missing from Mt. Gox.",-0.11089736842105263,-0.018076441102756892
122,U.S. Extends Investigation of JPMorgan Chase Hacking,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/business/us-extends-bank-breach-investigation.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-07-29T01:01:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"During the government’s long crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, investigators often looked for ties among a loose circle of friends. Now, federal authorities believe that some of the people suspected in last summer’s big online attack against JPMorgan Chase also turned to friends and acquaintances to further their ends. Three of the five men charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan a week ago in two criminal cases that grew out of the continuing investigation into the JPMorgan hacking attended classes at Florida State University at roughly the same time. Two of those men, Joshua Samuel Aaron and Anthony R. Murgio, both 31, belonged to the same fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, according to records kept by the Florida State fraternity and LinkedIn. A third man charged by prosecutors, Yuri Lebedev, 37, also went to that university with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron. On his LinkedIn page, Mr. Lebedev describes himself as working for a company led by Mr. Murgio’s brother, Joseph, another Florida State alumnus. But the circle of connections to the university and fraternity is bigger than the three alumni charged by prosecutors. At least five of the people whom the authorities contend Mr. Murgio appointed to a small credit union in New Jersey — which he is said to have taken control of last summer — also took classes at Florida State. Others were involved in a number of small companies that Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio formed in Florida over the last decade, most of which are no longer in operation. None of those university friends or past business associates of Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio have been charged with wrongdoing. Those people may also have known nothing about the specific criminal charges against Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio or the hacking of JPMorgan Chase. Still, criminal defense lawyers say the friends and acquaintances could represent a rich source of information for investigators trying to learn more about Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron and their activities. “What the investigators will do is look at people who know each other and have had contact with each other during critical junctures,” said Michael Bachner, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer who has represented a number of people charged with insider trading and stock manipulation. “People who have gone to school or are in business together are expected to speak to each other, and these investigators are going to follow all leads.” The names of Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron surfaced last fall in the early days of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the JPMorgan Chase breach that led to the theft of email addresses and contact information for more than 83 million customer accounts, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Federal authorities have not commented on what led them to identify Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron early in the inquiry and no one has been charged with the attack against JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank. So far, Mr. Murgio, Mr. Aaron, Mr. Lebedev and two other men also charged by prosecutors are accused of committing crimes that on the surface appear to be unrelated. Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev are charged with running an illegal Bitcoin money transfer operation called Coin.mx, which processed transactions for web criminals who plant malicious software, called ransomware, to seize control of computers. The software generally can be removed only by paying a ransom, often in the form of the digital currency Bitcoin. Mr. Aaron and two Israeli citizens, Gery Shalon, 31, and Ziv Orenstein, 41, were charged with overseeing a multiyear stock manipulation scheme involving largely worthless penny stocks. Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein were arrested in Israel and were being held in custody pending an Aug. 10 hearing. Mr. Aaron, an American citizen who grew up in Maryland but has been living in Israel for the last several years, was not arrested and is believed by the authorities to be in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen. Last Thursday, two F.B.I. agents visited Mr. Aaron’s parents’ home in Potomac, Md., and the home of his grandparents in Silver Spring, Md., seeking information about his whereabouts, said one person who was approached by the agents. Federal authorities are said to suspect that Mr. Aaron and Mr. Shalon may have wanted to use some of the millions of email addresses stolen in the JPMorgan hacking to further a stock manipulation scheme by sending out spam emails promoting penny stocks. It was not clear how Mr. Aaron, who majored in real estate at Florida State but did not graduate, became connected with Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein. People briefed on the matter said they suspect others in Russia may have carried out the actual attack on JPMorgan on the instructions of Mr. Aaron and others. Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio were said to be frequent visitors to Russia. Mr. Murgio was released from the Pinellas County Jail on Friday after posting a $100,000 bond. His brother, Joseph Murgio, speaking by phone, said that Mr. Murgio, who graduated from Florida State in 2007 with a degree in marketing, was now focused on putting together his legal team. He said that his brother wanted to tell his story but would first see what was written about him in the news media. “His main concern right now is his legal representation,” Joseph Murgio said. Prosecutors contend that Anthony Murgio tried to conceal some of the illegal activities of his Bitcoin exchange by taking control of a small credit union in Jackson, N.J., called Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union, which caters largely to lower-income members. The authorities did not identify the “individuals close” to Mr. Murgio who they said had been appointed to the board. But an archived profile page for the credit union filed with the National Credit Union Administration, the industry’s federal regulator, lists the names of five people on the board, all of whom attended classes at Florida State. Mr. Lebedev is listed in the archived filing as vice chairman of the credit union. One of those people appointed to the board is a lawyer in New Jersey who graduated from Florida State’s law school in 2011. The lawyer declined to comment, as did the two other people with Florida State ties on the credit union board. In November, the credit union regulator forced Mr. Lebedev and the other board members with connections to Mr. Murgio to step down after it became concerned about a sharp increase in the dollar value of transactions being processed by a credit union with less than $300,000 in assets. The federal prosecutors’ criminal complaint said the credit union did not have the appropriate anti-money-laundering procedures in place to “handle such voluminous payment processing.” The complaint also referred to some of the board members as “co-conspirators.” Both Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio also had a number of business ventures in Florida, several of which either failed or were discontinued. Mr. Murgio, for instance, operated restaurants in Tallahassee and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Mr. Aaron, while in Florida, formed two companies with another Florida State classmate and fraternity member. He also formed a venture with Mr. Murgio, according to Florida corporate records. On Tuesday, Mr. Lebedev, wearing a gray suit and gold-patterned tie, appeared before United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas in the Federal District Court in Manhattan to respond to the criminal charges against him. No plea was entered and he remained free on a $25,000 bond. His lawyer, Mark Barnett, declined to comment after the proceeding. Mr. Murgio is expected to travel to New York in the next few days for a similar court appearance.",-0.03665729166666667,-0.02433503080638497
123,"The World Wide Web, the New Frontier in Fraud",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/28/business/dealbook/the-world-wide-web-the-new-frontier-in-fraud.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-07-27T18:49:48+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Welcome to the latest frontier in white-collar crime, where just finding the criminals is often the greatest challenge. Charges filed last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan in two seemingly unrelated cases give a small peek into the dark world of online crime, in which client information is swapped and the proceeds are sent over networks using new digital currency. As The New York Times reported, what may tie the cases together is a suspected link to the hacking of JPMorgan Chase’s network in 2014. In that incident, contact information for 83 million customer and small-business accounts was obtained, although the bank says that no financial information such as account numbers was taken. The security breach appears to have some connection to hackers operating in Russia. That makes it more challenging to find the perpetrators because of that nation’s continuing political tensions with the United States. Who was behind the breach, and how the information might have been used, remains shrouded in mystery at this point. The charges filed last week in the two cases make no mention of hacking into JPMorgan’s network, and it is unclear whether any of the bank’s client contact information was used or sold. But there are hints at how defendants in one case might have used the information from the breach. The Justice Department charged three men with securities fraud, identity theft and money-laundering conspiracy related to manipulation of penny stocks in 2011 and 2012, in what are known as pump-and-dump schemes. Two of the defendants, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, are Israeli citizens. They were arrested there last week and are being held. The third defendant, Joshua Samuel Aaron, is an American citizen living in Israel who is thought to have been in Russia recently, but he has not yet been arrested. The indictment is a bare-bones set of allegations that gives few details about how the shares were manipulated. A statement by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, asserts that the defendants funneled “millions of dollars in unlawful proceeds through a web of international shell companies.” But the indictment itself has nothing about how much money they made from the scheme or the amount of losses that investors suffered. The money-laundering conspiracy references transactions totaling about $1 million, but little else about any connection to the penny-stock fraud. The government’s filing is clearly a placeholder intended to allow the Justice Department to request the arrest of the three defendants by Israeli authorities and begin the extradition process. We can expect more details as the government supplies evidence to have Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein sent to the United States, but those proceedings can be slow if the defendants fight extradition. It may seem far-fetched that the JPMorgan breach figures into a penny-stock fraud. But a pump-and-dump scheme is built on the axiom attributed to P.T. Barnum that “there’s a sucker born every minute.” To make such a fraud work requires finding enough gullible investors to buy shares in thinly traded companies so that those who control the shares can sell their positions. The indictment accuses the three defendants of sending out spam email that promoted the shares of various companies to generate buying interest. Because penny stocks are not followed by the major brokerage firms, it is easy to drive up the price through sham trading and false rumors and make the so-called suckers think that the price is escalating because of corporate developments. A price rise of just 50 cents from the pump can generate enormous profits when millions of shares are quickly dumped. The lifeblood of this type of fraud is a fresh supply of potential customers, so gaining access to the JPMorgan customer contact information could be quite valuable. Prosecutors have not yet shown such a link between the security breach and the defendants. But it is a tantalizing possibility that customer information was used for something as prosaic as an old-fashioned penny-stock fraud. The links between the pump-and-dump scheme and the JPMorgan attack grow with the second case filed last week in Manhattan against Anthony R. Murgio and Yuri Lebedev. That complaint accuses them of operating an illegal money-transfer firm called Coin.mx that converted Bitcoin, the digital currency, into cash for criminals. The Times described on Sunday how Bitcoin had become “a new preferred method for hostage takers” who seize computers and websites and then demand ransom payments in the form of the digital currency. A memorandum from the Federal Bureau of Investigation written last year identified Mr. Murgio as having some link to the JPMorgan breach, although the details remain sketchy. In an interesting twist, Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev attended Florida State University with Mr. Aaron, the missing defendant in the penny-stock case who was last thought to be in Russia. The penny-stock defendants are accused of using accounts for Cyprus-based shell companies to launder the profits from the stock sales. The complaint against the Bitcoin exchange defendants describes using accounts in Cyprus, Hong Kong and Eastern Europe for their transactions. Mr. Murgio is also accused of taking control of a credit union in New Jersey to process transactions, showing the vulnerability of domestic financial institutions to misuse. This all may be just a grand coincidence, but it shows the web of connections in the world of online crime and the challenges that investigators face when they try to build cases. Digital currency can disappear in the blink of an eye and bounce through numerous accounts in places where there is little transparency. Penny-stock frauds can be conducted anywhere in the world as long as there is access to servers and email. We have become accustomed to hearing about computer network attacks and identity theft involving a number of different companies. And the controversy about Bitcoin being involved for illegal transactions is nothing new. Yet, unlike other types of white-collar crime such as insider trading, prosecutors are struggling to even identify suspects behind these attacks, let alone preventing them from being so profitable. In the Old West, it was a matter of chasing down train robbers like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Today, it requires penetrating the layers of secrecy provided by the Internet and countries that encourage bank secrecy. It is easy to see that a crime has taken place, but getting the robbers is more difficult than ever.",-0.14824038461538458,0.017431283993783995

The transaction would create a company with estimated, pro forma revenue of $26 billion in 2016, including about $11 billion in sales outside the United States, Teva said. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan would receive $33.75 billion in cash and shares worth about $6.75 billion, representing an ownership stake of under 10 percent in Teva.  The deal could bolster Teva’s market position as the world’s biggest seller of generic medicines, Michael J. de la Merced notes in DealBook. The acquisition may also end Teva’s monthslong pursuit of Mylan, a rival that has rebuffed takeover offers and is trying to buy another drug maker. The Wall Street Journal, which had reported the deal, notes that Teva is under pressure because its top selling product, a brand-name multiple sclerosis treatment called Copaxone, is facing lower-priced competition in the United States.   Allergan is a powerhouse with a market value of more than $120 billion, made up of Actavis, a generic drug maker; and Allergan, best known as the maker of Botox. The old Allergan entity had been fending off an unwanted takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and the hedge fund magnate William A. Ackman. Actavis trumped Valeant’s $53 billion offer by paying $66 billion and then took Allergan’s name.   The Actavis-Allergan deal was aimed at diversifying beyond generic drugs, a business that is increasingly saturated with products with lower profit margins. Allergan is now looking at parting ways with this major business line and announced on Sunday that it had agreed to buy a developer of drugs for depression and other central nervous system disorders. 
 FIDELITY SEEN AS MUSCLING IN  |  The steward of Fidelity Management and Research, a $5.2 trillion mutual fund and asset management empire, promises to treat investors fairly and put their interests first, but shareholders in the small British telecom company Colt say Fidelity is taking a decidedly different approach, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. They say the mutual fund is putting its own interests ahead of other Colt owners by forcing them to accept its buyout offer for the company at a bargain-basement price.   After being a star in the early 2000s, Colt’s stock collapsed when the tech stock bubble burst and has rarely traded above 200 pence, or about $3, in the last decade. But its fortunes may be changing, shareholders say. They object to Fidelity’s 190-pence bid for the shares it doesn’t already own, saying that recent acquisitions of operations similar to Colt’s were completed at much higher prices.   Although dissenting shareholders agree that an auction of the company, where interested companies could make their best offers, is the right thing to do, Fidelity has made this impossible. Its bid notes that it would not sell its shares to any third party before December 2016.   “In this situation where Colt is an illiquid stock, it’s difficult for a white knight to show up and protect the minorities,” says Andrew Sinwell, a longtime telecom investor and chief executive of an investment firm that owns Colt shares. 
 PEARSON DISCUSSES SELLING ECONOMIST STAKE  |  The British education company Pearson said it was in talks to sell its 50 percent stake in the Economist Group, Ravi Somaiya reports in DealBook. Pearson just last week reached a deal to sell The Financial Times to the Japanese media group Nikkei for $1.3 billion, saying it wanted to focus on its core education business. Pearson’s stake in the Economist Group is reported to be worth more than $600 million.   The talks about The Economist are focused on other shareholders of the group, including wealthy families like the Schroders, the Cadburys and the Agnellis, The Financial Times reports. Exor, the Agnelli family’s holding company, is reported to be in talks to raise its 4.72 percent stake in the Economist Group.   The German media company Axel Springer and the financial information company Bloomberg have also been approached after they came close to buying The Financial Times, but both declined to pursue the purchase because owning shares would not allow control.

 BITCOIN IS THE NEW RANSOM CURRENCY  |  Forget the briefcase of unmarked bills. Modern-day hostage takers want the virtual currency Bitcoin, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Victims of mob shakedowns these days find that their only way out is through a Bitcoin payment.   Criminals like the virtual currency because it can be held in a digital wallet that does not have to be registered with the authorities and can easily be exchanged for real money. At the moment, a single Bitcoin is going for about $290.   Bitcoin makes the delivery of a ransom more seamless and untraceable. Its system is run by a decentralized network of computers that collects no personal information about users. An in-person meeting is unnecessary. Its transactions are also irreversible — victims cannot reclaim their money as they might with a credit card or PayPal transaction.   Although Bitcoin has gained mainstream appeal recently, the proliferation of ransom demands is an unhappy reminder of its continued appeal in the criminal underworld, even after the online black market bazaar Silk Road was shut down.   Some in the Bitcoin community have suggested potential ways to fend off ransom threats, such as digitally marking coins used for ransom payments, but solutions have been held up because of the value that many Bitcoin believers have put in the virtual currency’s unfettered free movement.

These days, there’s a new preferred method for hostage takers: the virtual currency Bitcoin. In a modern day version of a mob shakedown, hackers around the world have seized files on millions of computers, taken down public websites and even, in a few cases, threatened physical harm. The victims — who have ranged from ordinary computer users to financial firms and police departments — are told that their only way out is through a Bitcoin payment that is sometimes more than $20,000. One set of attackers, believed to be based in Russia and Ukraine, collected about $16.5 million in Bitcoins in a little over a month, primarily from victims in the United States, according to the security firm Sophos. Criminals like the virtual currency because it can be held in a digital wallet that does not have to be registered with any government or financial authority — and because it can be easily exchanged for real money. At the moment, a single Bitcoin can be sold online or on the street for around $290. “The criminal underground very much likes Bitcoin,” said Curt Wilson, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Arbor Networks. “It’s enabled a greater sense of obfuscation.” Bitcoin, which was released by an anonymous creator in 2009, has recently been gaining mainstream appeal. Start-ups in the industry have won investments from big names like Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange, which have praised the technology as a faster, more efficient way to complete financial transactions. But the proliferation of ransom demands has provided an unhappy reminder of the virtual currency’s continuing appeal to the criminal underworld, long after the authorities shut down the online drug bazaar, Silk Road, where heroin and cocaine were sold using Bitcoin. The latest reminder of Bitcoin’s underbelly came last week with the arrest of two Florida men. The authorities said victims of malware were steered to Coin.mx, a site run by the two men, to buy the Bitcoins to pay the ransom demanded by the malware. The complaint suggested that the criminals also used the site to launder their proceeds. In a separate set of recent cases, security experts said, several financial firms have been attacked by a criminal, or circle of criminals, going by the name DD4BC, who have threatened to overwhelm the firms’ public websites with message traffic unless a Bitcoin payment was made. These corporate victims are generally asked to pay about $10,000, the security experts said, and the attacks have shown no signs of abating. “Do not ignore me, as it will just increase the price,” DD4BC said in one email that was made public. “Once you pay me you are free from me for the lifetime of your site.” Ted Weisberg, the president of the brokerage firm Seaport Securities, which was hit in June, said that he initially thought the message was a joke. But as he called competitors, he said, he quickly learned that the threat was real. Seaport’s website ended up being down for a day and a half. Mr. Weisberg’s firm did not pay the ransom and repelled the bombardment of traffic with the help of one of its technical providers. The extortion attempts have been widespread enough that the brokerage industry’s self-governing regulatory agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, warned its members in June to contact the F.B.I. if they received a message from DD4BC. Ransom payments entered the digital world long before Bitcoin came on the scene. Previously, though, the methods for paying attackers could be cumbersome and risky for the extortionist. A credit card payment or bank transfer could easily be traced by the police, so the victims were usually asked to buy prepaid cards like Green Dot’s MoneyPak. Partly because of their use by swindlers, these cards were recently taken off the market. Bitcoin has made the delivery of ransom more seamless and untraceable for criminals because the virtual currency system is run by a decentralized network of computers that collects no personal information about users. Unlike the days of bulging briefcases, Bitcoin payments can be made without an in-person meeting. What’s more, Bitcoin transactions are designed to be irreversible, so victims cannot reclaim their money as they could with a credit card or PayPal transaction. Early Bitcoin users quickly realized that the currency could be useful for ransom payments. But in late 2013, the threat spread far beyond the virtual currency community when the first version of Bitcoin-fueled ransomware, known as CryptoLocker, began to spread around the globe. The software encrypted all of the files on a computer and offered a key to unlock the files in exchange for a Bitcoin payment. Victims were directed to several websites where they could buy Bitcoins through a bank transfer. When an alliance of international authorities took down CryptoLocker in mid-2014 and identified the mastermind as a 30-year-old Russian named Evgeniy Bogachev, the group said that the software had spread to 234,000 computers. Since then, much more virulent strains have popped up, most of them under the name CryptoWall, and spread even more widely to the computers of anyone who opened infected attachments. The authorities have had trouble estimating the number of victims because many do not report their problem and quietly pay the price. But in late 2014, Dell SecureWorks said CryptoWall had infected over 800,000 computers. New versions of the malware, going by names like TorrentLocker and Dirty Decrypt, have popped up frequently since then.  A police department in Durham, N.H., that was hit by CryptoWall in June 2014, refused to hand over the ransom and was able to revert to backup files. But more recently, police departments in Dickson County, Tenn., and Tewksbury, Mass., have said that they chose to pay the roughly $500 ransom rather than deal with the headache of trying to circumvent the hackers.  Beyond these attacks, extortionists went after two longtime Bitcoin advocates last year, threatening to exploit personal information about the men’s families if they did not pay up. When one of the men, Hal Finney, refused to submit, the assailant called the local police and reported a murder at Mr. Finney’s home, resulting in a SWAT team taking over the home, the family has said. The other victim, Roger Ver, threw off his attacker by offering a Bitcoin bounty of roughly $20,000 for his attacker’s arrest.  Some leaders in the Bitcoin community have suggested potential ways to fend off the ransom threats, digitally marking any coins used for ransom payments, similar to how dollar bills used in hostage situations are marked with invisible dye. But such solutions have been held up because of the value that many Bitcoin believers have put in the virtual currency’s unfettered free movement.",-0.17209166666666667,0.04142892215808882

Murgio attended a college friend’s wedding in Atlanta, seemingly without a care in the world. Yet the day before, unbeknown to Mr. Murgio, federal prosecutors in Manhattan had filed two criminal complaints, under seal, that accused him and another former college classmate, Yuri Lebedev, of running an illegal Bitcoin money exchange operation that enabled criminals operating online to convert the digital currency to cash. Both men were arrested at their homes in Florida Tuesday morning. That same day, the authorities in Israel seized two other men, who were charged with running a multiyear stock manipulation scheme. A third man was indicted but not arrested because he was not at his home in Israel. The two cases — which on the surface appear unrelated — are the first tantalizing clues to a long-running federal investigation into the huge hacking of JPMorgan Chase’s vast network last summer. That breach compromised some personal contact information for 83 million customer accounts. Federal authorities have suspected for months that some of the people arrested this week had a role in helping to carry out the attack, but have yet to officially link any of them to it. At least three of the people charged apparently knew one another for at least a decade, going back to when they were students at Florida State University. While their potential connection to the JPMorgan attack is unclear, two of those charged were identified last fall by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as having some link to the attack on the bank, people who were briefed on the matter said. One of those people said tens of millions of customers’ email addresses and phone numbers stolen from the bank may have been used as part of a subsequent stock manipulation scheme in which the accused would send spam emails promoting worthless stocks. The person said it was possible the actual hacking was done by others in Eastern Europe on the instructions of those overseeing the stock pump-and-dump scheme. While many questions remain, what is clear is that federal authorities were forced to move much sooner than they had wanted, partly out of concern that the investigation was becoming too public and that some of those charged might try to move to countries with no formal extradition process to the United States. On July 2, federal prosecutors sent a letter to Israeli authorities asking them to arrest three men charged with running a four-year stock manipulation scheme as soon as one of the men returned home to Tel Aviv from a trip outside the country. Prosecutors said they were concerned about news organizations making public some aspects of the investigation. In the letter, the prosecutors said a United States judge had issued arrest warrants for the men on June 2, after a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted the three on 11 counts of securities fraud in a sealed indictment. The letter from the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs included photographs of the three men and brief physical descriptions. On Tuesday, two of the men, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, were arrested at home in Israel when prosecutors in Manhattan asked a federal judge to have the indictment made public. The third, Joshua Samuel Aaron, was not arrested because he remained abroad and did not return to Israel by the middle of the month as federal prosecutors had expected. The authorities suspect Mr. Aaron may be in Russia, judging by photographs posted several weeks ago by his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, on several social media accounts. The letter asking Israel to assist with the arrests was made public during a court proceeding for Mr. Shalon, 31, and Mr. Orenstein, 41. An Israeli judge ordered both of them to remain in custody pending a hearing on Aug. 10. Mr. Aaron, 31, who was born in the United States and grew up in Maryland, lives in Tel Aviv. In the letter to Israeli authorities, federal prosecutors said that in the past “Shalon caused the massive quantity of spam emails to be transmitted through his and Aaron’s control of numerous servers, domain names, email accounts and accounts with third-party email distribution companies under Shalon’s control.” Federal prosecutors said they would seek to extradite the Israeli defendants for trial in Manhattan. In the United States, Mr. Lebedev, who lives in a town near Jacksonville, was released on Tuesday after posting a $25,000 bond. Mr. Murgio remained in custody late Thursday at the Pinellas County Jail in Clearwater, having failed to post a $100,000 bond. Mark Barnett, a lawyer for Mr. Lebedev, declined to comment. Adam Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. Murgio, did not return a call seeking comment. Mr. Murgio, Mr. Aaron and Mr. Lebedev were all students at Florida State University. In 2008, Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron formed a business in West Palm Beach, Fla., called Health Universe L.L.C. It closed about a year later. Mr. Lebedev, 37, who graduated from Florida State with degrees in computer science and mathematics in 2004 and 2008, lists himself as a software architect for company led by Mr. Murgio’s brother. Mr. Murgio, 31, who graduated with a degree in marketing in 2007, had run a number of failed restaurant businesses and other ventures. In 2012, then living in Tallahassee, Mr. Murgio filed for bankruptcy, claiming he had $545,000 in debts.  Mr. Aaron, who majored in real estate, left Florida State in 2005 without a degree, a university spokesman said. For a time he ran a small business called Josh Aaron L.L.C. out of his parents’ home in Potomac, Md., before moving to Israel. Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev went into the Bitcoin money exchange business in 2013, providing a platform for criminals who put malicious malware on computers and then demand a ransom payment in Bitcoin to unfreeze those computers. The prosecutors said Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev sought to conceal their money transfer activities by taking effective control of a small credit union in New Jersey that mainly served low-income members. They did not identify the credit union, but people briefed on the matter said it is Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union in Jackson, N.J. Charles E. Blue Sr., the credit union’s chief executive, said, “We cannot comment on ongoing investigations.” It is not clear how Mr. Aaron became associated with Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein. Federal authorities contend that the men began orchestrating so-called pump-and-dump penny stock schemes in 2011. In pump-and-dumps, promoters drive up the price of worthless stocks and pitch them to unsuspecting investors. The organizers then sell the shares before the price crashes. In an odd twist, Mr. Aaron’s elderly grandparents in Maryland were almost victims of fraud in 2012. Late that year, a person called up pretending to be a relative and demanding money. In this case, the caller claimed to be Mr. Aaron and said he was in jail in Greece and needed $3,500. It’s a familiar ruse that consumer advocates have called the “grandparent scam.” But Mr. Aaron’s grandparents knew that the caller was not their grandson and that the story was a hoax.

127,Nathaniel Popper’s ‘Digital Gold’ Looks at Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/books/review/nathaniel-poppers-digital-gold-looks-at-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-07-02T13:42:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"If you wanted to create an entirely new world, like that in “Star Wars,” or in Neal Stephenson’s “Cryptonomicon,” you would certainly need an entirely new form of money. As Nathaniel Popper points out in his new book, “Digital Gold,” which tracks the roller-coaster ride of the digital currency called Bitcoin, it’s not surprising that part of its appeal to its devotees is that it could enable the creation of that new world, a libertarian utopia. Bitcoins — which are created, or mined, via complex computer algorithms, and are stored in digital wallets — offer privacy: Although every transaction is recorded, the users are identified only by wallet IDs, which are difficult, if not impossible, to track back to their owners. Theoretically, Bitcoins also allow users to avoid any fees or meddling by a middleman like a bank, because buyers and sellers can deal directly with one another. At its grandest, Bitcoin promises freedom from the clunkiness of cash, from the dominance of central banks and from technology that allows us to be tracked, even by our own governments. On a more prosaic level, why shouldn’t money be as vulnerable to technological disruption as, say, music? Popper tells his story through a global cast of characters — technologists, altruists, evangelists, crooks and money men — who are every bit as memorable as Han Solo. There is the enigmatic, mysterious figure calling himself Satoshi, who in 2008 wrote what came to be known as the “Bitcoin White Paper,” which provided the basis of the code that created Bitcoins. “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future,” Satoshi writes just as his invention is becoming more widely adopted, and while Popper never figures out who Satoshi actually is, he does, toward the end of his book, come to what seems to be a decent guess. (In a subsequent article, Popper has elaborated on what he calls “one of the great mysteries of the digital age.” He writes that there’s a “quiet but widely held belief” that Satoshi is one Nick Szabo, a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent who has played a critical role in Bitcoin’s development, but who denies that he is actually Satoshi.) One of the early adopters of Satoshi’s invention was a man named Hal Finney, who was, Popper writes, “particularly drawn to Satoshi’s claims that users could own and trade Bitcoins without providing identifying information to any central authorities.” The late Finney, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, and used his early stash of Bitcoins to pay for home care as his illness intensified, was a true and pure believer, as is the entrepreneur Roger Ver, who described Bitcoins as “the most important invention since the Internet itself. The world is changing because of Bitcoin right in front of our eyes.” But Popper uses his characters to show the diverse set of intentions and motivations among Bitcoin’s promoters. He ­introduces us to the Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares, who sees in Bitcoin a way to fix the woes his own country has experienced with a currency its citizens can’t trust. It’s Casares who helps get money men into Bitcoin — including Pete Briger, who runs the Fortress Investment Group — and they have their own reasons for buying in. “Pete’s job as an investor in distressed companies made him good at spotting broken systems, and the more he thought about it, the more broken the current methods of moving money around the world seemed to him,” Popper writes. Bitcoin grows, and Popper pulls its ­contradictions to the surface. For instance, many people were willing to compromise the purity and power of the code for the convenience of having someone else handle the work before them. As Popper writes, “The choice was between security and principles on one hand and convenience on the other.” So Jed McCaleb, an iconoclastic math and science prodigy, creates a site called Mt. Gox, where people could buy and sell Bitcoins without having any understanding of the code themselves. After the demands of running it prove too much, McCaleb sells Mt. Gox to a disenfranchised young man named Mark Karpeles, whose inability to deal with real human beings would prove to be his, and perhaps Bitcoin’s, downfall. Popper reports that Karpeles, who sets up shop in Tokyo, was “two years into running the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, but he had still not attended a single Bitcoin event abroad — a fact that he blamed on the sickness of his cat, Tibanne, who needed daily shots that Mark believed only he could administer.” The meltdown at Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014, is a story so deliciously weird that it would stand all on its own. But Mt. Gox is only one of the strange threads Popper follows through the history of Bitcoin. He also tells its darkest side through Ross Ulbricht, the surfer scientist and libertarian child of hippies, who ­created Silk Road, where people could engage in illegal transactions under the shroud of anonymity generated by Bitcoin. Silk Road became the Internet’s most infamous illicit bazaar and was the first killer app for Bitcoin. Popper perfectly juxtaposes the tale of federal agents’ old-school efforts to apprehend Ulbricht — who took the name Dread Pirate ­Roberts and justified his most morally reprehensible ­decisions in the name of freedom — with the growing mainstream interest in Bitcoin, from Silicon Valley to New York to the Federal Reserve itself, not as a revolutionary tool but as a practical way to update our currently creaky and pricey methods of moving money. (In May, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison.) In an irony of sorts, the cryptographic technologies at the heart of Bitcoin might themselves have great value as a tool for authenticating previously hard-to-trace transactions. As Bitcoin is adopted by the moneyed class as a better mousetrap for the establishment, it inevitably risks becoming something its original adherents despise. Popper also charts the rise of a stealth company called 21e6, backed by the Valley’s elite, which harnesses technology to create Bitcoins more efficiently than anyone else, thereby mining money for those who already have plenty. The most poignant moment in the book comes when Popper contrasts a conference for the more ideologically minded Bitcoiners at a racetrack on the outskirts of Austin, where Ulbricht grew up, with the gathering of the rich and powerful at the South by Southwest festival, where Ulbricht’s mother is politely dismissed as she pleads for funds to help defray her son’s legal costs. It was an “unhappy reminder of a side of Bitcoin” that its new adherents “wanted to put behind them,” Popper writes. And as he notes, “If this was the new world, it didn’t seem all that different from the old one — at least not yet.” Popper wants to tell us every last ­detail, and while the anecdotes have a you-were-there quality, the book does border on ­becoming encyclopedic at times. I wish he had left some characters out in order to let other stories unspool a little more slowly and pointedly, like when a hacker who manages to track Finney through Bitcoin targets him and his family, demanding ransom as Finney is dying. Nor can “Digital Gold” be a tale with a satisfying ending, because the future of Bitcoin is unknowable right now. As the venture capitalist Barry Silbert says at a Goldman Sachs conference, Bitcoin “is either going to change everything, or nothing.” But if Bitcoin doesn’t change every­thing, people will keep trying to find something that will, and so Popper’s book stands as necessary reading, and very intriguing at that, regardless of the eventual fate of his subject.",0.15040857142857145,0.1275818559747131

Lawsky, New York’s top financial regulator, on Wednesday released rules for running a Bitcoin business in the state. In a speech at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington, Mr. Lawsky announced the final set of rules that govern virtual-currency businesses, concluding a nearly two-year effort to regulate the growing Bitcoin industry. Mr. Lawsky said that the final form of the so-called BitLicense would put in place crucial guidelines for protecting consumers and preventing money laundering. “We are excited about the potential digital currency holds for helping drive long-overdue changes in our ossified payments system,” he said. “We simply want to make sure that we put in place guardrails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity, without stifling beneficial innovation.” The new rules are among the last initiatives Mr. Lawsky will put in place before he leaves government this month to start his own legal and consulting firm. In his four-year tenure, he has fashioned a name for himself as a tough overseer of the banking and insurance industries, cracking down on the likes of Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered. Such has been his reputation that The Village Voice once depicted him on its cover with a cowboy hat and sheriff’s badge, calling him “Johnny Lawsky.” His push to create rules governing virtual currencies may be among the most sweeping to date. New York is the first state to do so, seeking to create a replacement for money transmission guidelines that, Mr. Lawsky said, date to the Civil War. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have grown in popularity both in the global technology community and on Wall Street. The Nasdaq OMX Group and the New York Stock Exchange have announced initiatives tied to Bitcoin. And last month, Goldman Sachs invested in Circle, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments. Among the requirements outlined in the new regulations are the presence of a compliance officer and the maintenance of capital reserves determined by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Throughout the process, some Bitcoin advocates have questioned whether Mr. Lawsky was overstepping his boundaries and proposing regulations that could throttle the nascent technology. Critics on the Internet site Reddit satirized the regulator by depicting him atop the Iron Throne from the HBO series “Game of Thrones” with the caption “Hail King Lawsky.” In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Lawsky said that the main goal had been to provide useful guidelines for virtual currency businesses rather than stifle the emerging technology altogether. The BitLicense, he said, applies only to financial operations and not to software developers, individual users or retailers who accept Bitcoin payments. “Financial regulators and policy makers need to recognize that when it comes to digital currencies and other new payments technology, the genie is already out of the bottle,” he said. Mr. Lawsky added that regulators and proponents of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies needed to work together to make sure that new technologies continue to flourish while protecting consumers. Still, some within the virtual currency industry took a dim view of the new rules. Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, took issue with anti-money-laundering provisions of the final guidelines, which it contended were too vague. “It’s a mixed bag, is the best that can be said about the BitLicense,” Jerry Brito, Coin Center’s executive director, said in a statement. “Other states are already looking to the BitLicense as a model for their own frameworks. We are working with them to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes made here.”",0.16301666666666667,0.049314674523007855

130,I Created ‘The Bernank’ on YouTube. And I Was Mostly Wrong.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/business/dealbook/bernank-financial-crisis.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-10-01T15:15:02+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"In November 2010, as the Federal Reserve embarked on its second round of bond buying, Omid Malekan uploaded to YouTube a cartoon called “Quantitative Easing Explained,” which was critical of the central bank’s response to the financial crisis. Within weeks, millions of people had viewed it. Here, nearly eight years later, he says that he got it largely wrong. It has been 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the unofficial start of the financial crisis. For those of us in finance who lived through that period, and the countless others affected by it, it remains hard to think of it as just a moment in history. A decade removed, the experience feels more like a mass injury that — grateful as we are to have survived — still lingers, and often manifests itself in the ongoing controversy over the government’s response. I am a small part of that controversy, thanks to a YouTube cartoon I published in 2010 criticizing the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The popularity of that cartoon surprised me. Like most things that go viral, it was more a testament to what was on people’s minds than the quality of the work. Nevertheless, terms used in the cartoon like “The Bernank” entered the economic zeitgeist, resonating with people who knew that they didn’t like what was happening but lacked the technical vocabulary to express why. Most of the targets of my cartoon, including Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have defended their actions and maintained that their work was effective in keeping the economic harm from worsening. I’m inclined to agree. Quantitative easing worked, just not in the way it was intended. Before I explain why, I need to admit what I got wrong. Contrary to what one of my cartoon characters predicted, Q.E. didn’t “blow up the global economy.” Instead, both economic growth and the financial markets have been remarkably steady. If anything, the expansion of central bank balance sheets has dampened volatility. It’s still possible that the reversal of those policies will have a destabilizing effect, but even if that does happen — and I hope it doesn’t — I was still way off the mark. The current economic expansion is one of the longest in history, and that too has surprised me. If you had asked me to predict the odds of another major recession eight years ago, not only would I have called it likely, I probably would have added that the very policies used to deal with the 2008 financial crisis would cause it. I was wrong about that, too. So what did I get right? There’s a false belief in some circles that my cartoon was among the chorus of critics that predicted an inevitable debasement of the dollar — a belief possibly spurred by Mr. Bernanke’s reference to my work in his memoir. But my focus, as can still be seen in the cartoon, was on the mechanics of Q.E. Ironically, those mechanics are something that Mr. Bernanke and I have always agreed on. He has often defended his actions by arguing that Q.E. is not the same as printing money because it only affects reserves in the banking system. Leaving aside the obvious overlap between the two concepts, I believe he’s right. Q.E. was, first and foremost, a policy designed to enrich banks. In that sense, it worked remarkably, and tragically, well. Thanks to the one-two punch of the bailouts (some of which were also financed by the Fed) and Q.E., our banking system came back from the brink of collapse in just a few years. In 2010, Wall Street managed near-record profitability and paid near-record bonuses. This was no accident. As Mr. Bernanke argued in a Washington Post op-ed in late 2010 (and exactly one week before the publication of my cartoon), the two primary outcomes of Q.E. are lower interest rates and higher asset prices. Nobody benefits from either of those more than Wall Street does. Left unmentioned in the op-ed were those guaranteed to not benefit, like the substantial portion of the population that doesn’t own any assets, or the countless people that could never get a loan. Lower rates are viewed as desirable in a downturn because they spur borrowing. But that belief — held by the vast majority of economists — leaves out the inconvenient truth of who it is that gets to borrow in the first place, especially in the aftermath of a crisis. The millions of people who lost their homes in foreclosures, for example, don’t. Nor do the millions more who lost their jobs. Who does benefit? All the parties that have done disproportionately well in the past decade, like investment funds, large corporations and the wealthy. Debt levels have exploded among those groups, as have the valuations of the assets they tend to own: private companies, premium real estate and stocks. For this, I give Mr. Bernanke credit. History turned out almost as he predicted in his op-ed: “Almost” because the only thing missing from his prediction were the words “for some people.” One of the great ironies of monetary debates over the past decade is the consensus that you should not just print money and hand it out to ordinary citizens. That, as Mr. Bernanke argued in a series of essays published by the Brookings Institution a few years ago, should only be considered as a last resort. It is better, he argues, to send money to the banks. According to government data, almost a fifth of the United States population is either “underbanked” or entirely disconnected from the financial system — a percentage that grew after the 2008 crisis. These are the people who have suffered the most in the past decade. Their existence outside the banking system almost guaranteed that they would not benefit from policies like lower interest rates. Quantitative easing worked, but not for those who needed it most. There was one other thing that I got wrong about the government’s response to the financial crisis. I assumed that the effects, and side-effects, would be felt in the economic realm. But today, it’s the political, social and even technological consequences that stand out. The growing wealth gap, which we now understand to be at least partially caused by such policies, has fueled many political and social movements. In this era of political polarization, the one belief that the far left and the far right increasingly share is that our economic system is somehow rigged. That perception has played a part in everything from the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Most surprising of all, though, is that there is now a new kind of money — one borne out of the chaos of the financial crisis and the controversial policies enacted thereafter. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are the technological solution to a legacy monetary system that increasingly looks unfair. The decentralized nature and radical transparency of cryptocurrencies are a response to a banking system where institutions that were “too big to fail” have been enriched by Q.E. The code that underpins the Bitcoin blockchain is designed to treat the poorest citizen exactly the same way as the most powerful banker. After everything that’s happened in the past decade, we can no longer say the same thing about the Fed. I disagree with some of my colleagues in the so-called cryptosphere on the potential for such coins to ever fully replace fiat money. But I am a proponent for many reasons, including the lifeboat they offer from poorly conceived economic policy. Despite the enduring controversy of the policies enacted in response to the financial crisis, their architects promise to repeat them in the future. But next time, those of us who are adversely impacted by such policies, or just morally opposed to them, won’t have to stand idly by. Next time, we can take our money elsewhere.",-0.045844444444444445,0.06814744668911336

But even among those who said this, few could resist debating the clues the founder left behind. As I had these conversations with the programmers and entrepreneurs who are most deeply involved in Bitcoin, I encountered a quiet but widely held belief that much of the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo. Mr. Szabo is nearly as much of a mystery as Satoshi. But in the course of my reporting I kept turning up new hints that drew me further into the chase, and I even stumbled into a rare encounter with Mr. Szabo at a private gathering of top Bitcoin programmers and entrepreneurs. At that event, Mr. Szabo denied that he was Satoshi, as he has consistently in electronic communications, including in an email on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that his history left little question that he was among a small group of people who, over decades, working sometimes cooperatively and sometimes in competition, laid the foundation for Bitcoin and created many parts that later went into the virtual currency. Mr. Szabo’s most notable contribution was a Bitcoin predecessor known as bit gold that achieved many of the same goals using similar tools of advanced math and cryptography. It may be impossible to prove Satoshi’s identity until the person or people behind Bitcoin’s curtain decide to come forward and prove ownership of Satoshi’s old electronic accounts. At this point, the creator’s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin’s future. Since Satoshi stopped contributing to the project in 2011, most of the open-source code has been rewritten by a group of programmers whose identities are known. But Mr. Szabo’s story provides insight into often misunderstood elements of Bitcoin’s creation. The software was not a bolt out of the blue, as is sometimes assumed, but was instead built on the ideas of multiple people over several decades. This history is more than just a matter of curiosity. The software has come to be viewed in academic and financial circles as a significant computer science breakthrough that may reshape the way money looks and moves. Recently, banks like Goldman Sachs have taken the first steps toward embracing the technology. Mr. Szabo himself has continued to be quietly involved in the work. In the beginning of 2014, Mr. Szabo joined Vaurum, a Bitcoin start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., that was operating in stealth mode and that aimed to build a better Bitcoin exchange. After his arrival, Mr. Szabo helped reorient the company to take advantage of the Bitcoin software’s capability for so-called smart contracts, which enable self-executing financial transactions, according to people briefed on the company’s operations who spoke on condition of anonymity. After Mr. Szabo led the company in a new direction, it was renamed Mirror, and it recently raised $12.5 million from several prominent venture capitalists, these people said. The company declined to comment for this article. Mr. Szabo’s role at Vaurum has been kept a secret because of his desire for privacy, and he left in late 2014 after becoming nervous about public exposure, according to the people briefed on the company’s operations. While he was still there, though, the array of arcane skills and knowledge at his command led several colleagues to conclude that Mr. Szabo was most likely involved in the creation of Bitcoin, even if he didn’t do it all himself. I met Mr. Szabo, a large bearded man, in March 2014 at a Bitcoin event at the Lake Tahoe vacation home of Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, Pantera Capital. Mr. Szabo worked for Vaurum at the time. Mr. Morehead and other hedge fund executives in attendance dressed in expensive loafers and slim-cut jeans; Mr. Szabo, his bald pate encircled by a ring of salt-and-pepper hair, wore beat-up black sneakers and an untucked striped shirt. While he kept to himself, I managed to corner him in the kitchen during the cocktail hour. He was notably reserved and deflected questions about where he lived and had worked, but he bristled when I cited what was being said about him on the Internet — including that he was a law professor at George Washington University — and the notion that he had created Bitcoin. “Well, I will say this, in the hope of setting the record straight,” he said acidly. “I’m not Satoshi, and I’m not a college professor. In fact, I never was a college professor.” The conversation grew less heated when I asked about the origin of the many complicated pieces of code and cryptography that went into the Bitcoin software, and about the small number of people who would have had the expertise to put them together. Mr. Szabo mentioned bit gold, saying it harnessed many of the same obscure concepts, like secure property titles and digital time stamps, that made Bitcoin possible. “There are a whole bunch of parallels,” he told me. “I mean, the reason people tag me is because you can go through secure property titles and bit gold — there are so many parallels between that and Bitcoin that you can’t find anywhere else.” When I asked if he believed that Satoshi had been familiar with his work, Mr. Szabo said he understood why there was so much speculation about his own role: “All I’m saying is, there are all these parallels, and it looks funny to me, and looks funny to a lot of other people.” Dinner began, interrupting the conversation, and I never got another chance to talk to Mr. Szabo. When I emailed him on Wednesday, he repeated his denial: “As I’ve stated many times before, all this speculation is flattering, but wrong — I am not Satoshi.” Many concepts central to Bitcoin were developed in an online community known as the Cypherpunks, a loosely organized group of digital privacy activists. As part of their mission, they set out to create digital money that would be as anonymous as physical cash. Mr. Szabo was a member, and in 1993, he wrote a message to fellow Cypherpunks describing the diverse motivations of attendees at a group meeting that had just taken place. Some people, he wrote, “are libertarians who want government out of our lives, others are liberals fighting the N.S.A., others find it great fun to ding people in power with cool hacks.” Mr. Szabo had a libertarian mind-set. He was drawn to those ideas partly, he told me, because of his father, who fought the communists in Hungary in the 1950s before coming to the United States, where Mr. Szabo was born 51 years ago. Reared in Washington State, Mr. Szabo studied computer science at the University of Washington. Several experiments in digital cash circulated on the Cypherpunk lists in the 1990s. Adam Back, a British researcher, created one called hashcash that later became a central component of Bitcoin. Another, called b money, was designed by an intensely private computer engineer named Wei Dai. When these experiments failed to take off, many Cypherpunks lost interest. But not Mr. Szabo. He worked for six months as a consultant for a company called DigiCash, he has written on his blog. In 1998, he sent the outline for his own version of digital money, which he called bit gold, to a small group that was still pursuing the project, including Mr. Dai and Hal Finney, a programmer based in Santa Barbara, Calif., who tried to create a working version of bit gold. The concept behind bit gold was very similar to Bitcoin: It included a digital token that was scarce, like gold, and could be sent electronically without needing to pass through a central authority like a bank. This history points to the important role that Mr. Szabo and several others played in developing the building blocks that went into Bitcoin. When Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper describing Bitcoin appeared in the fall of 2008, it cited Mr. Back’s hashcash. The first people Satoshi emailed privately were Mr. Back and Mr. Dai, both men have said. And Mr. Finney, who recently died, helped Satoshi improve the Bitcoin software in the fall of 2008, before it was publicly released, according to emails shared with me by Mr. Finney and his family. It is, though, Mr. Szabo’s activity in 2008, as Bitcoin emerged into the world, that has generated much of the suspicion about his role in the project. That spring, before anyone had ever heard of Satoshi Nakamoto or Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo revived his bit gold idea on his personal blog, and in an online conversation about creating a live version of the virtual currency, he asked his readers: “Anybody want to help me code one up?” After Bitcoin appeared, Mr. Szabo reposted the item on his blog in a way that changed the date at the top and made it appear as though it was written after Bitcoin’s release, archived versions of the website show. Mr. Szabo’s writing about bit gold from that time contains many striking parallels with Satoshi’s description of Bitcoin, including similar phrasings and even common writing mannerisms. In 2014, researchers at Aston University, in England, compared the writing of several people who have been suspected to be Satoshi and found that none matched up nearly as well as Mr. Szabo’s. The similarity was “uncanny,” said Jack Grieve, the lecturer who led the effort. When I went back and read Mr. Szabo’s online writings, it was obvious that in the year before Satoshi appeared on the scene and released Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo was again thinking seriously about digital money. He wrote frequently, over several months, about the concepts involved in digital money, including those smart contracts, a concept so specialized that Mr. Szabo is often given credit for inventing the term. Smart contracts later showed up as an essential piece of the Bitcoin software. Mr. Szabo’s blog explained why he was examining these issues with such passion: The global financial crisis then underway suggested to him that the monetary system was broken and in need of replacement. “For those who love our once and future freedoms, now is the time to strike,” Mr. Szabo wrote in an item on his blog in late 2007 endorsing the libertarian Ron Paul’s bid for the presidency, in part because of Mr. Paul’s views on the financial system. For many Bitcoin watchers, just as notable as what Mr. Szabo wrote in that period was his silence once Bitcoin appeared in October 2008. After all, the virtual currency was an experiment in everything he had been writing about for years. Unlike Mr. Dai, Mr. Finney and Mr. Back, Mr. Szabo has not released any correspondence from Satoshi from this period or acknowledged communicating with him. Mr. Szabo first made brief mention of Bitcoin on his blog in mid-2009, and in 2011, when the currency was still struggling to gain traction, he wrote about it again at greater length, noting the similarity between bit gold and Bitcoin. He acknowledged that few people would have had the expertise and the instinct to create either of them: “Myself, Wei Dai and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai’s case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).” That item, in May 2011, was one of the last posts Mr. Szabo made before he went on a lengthy hiatus to work, he said later, on a new concept he called temporal programming. May 2011 was also the last time Satoshi communicated privately with other Bitcoin contributors. In an email that month to Martti Malmi, one of the earliest participants, Satoshi wrote, “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future.” Whoever it is, the real Satoshi Nakamoto has many good reasons for wanting to stay anonymous. Perhaps the most obvious is potential danger. Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has concluded that Satoshi Nakamoto most likely collected nearly a million Bitcoins during the system’s first year. Given that each Bitcoin is now worth about $240, the stash could be worth more than $200 million. That could make Satoshi a target. With his modest clothes and unassuming manner, Mr. Szabo could be the kind of person who could have a fortune and not spend any of it — or even throw away the keys to the bank. People who know him say he drives a car from the 1990s. That modest outward appearance hasn’t diminished the deference toward him among Bitcoin cognoscenti. Potential employees were drawn to Vaurum when they heard that Mr. Szabo worked there, people who interviewed at the company said. They wanted to work alongside the person they suspected could be Satoshi Nakamoto — or who at least participated in Bitcoin’s invention.",0.08097279411764706,0.06755747724497724
132,Morning Agenda: 2 Banks Agree to Erase Zombie Debts,https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/morning-agenda-2-banks-agree-to-erase-zombie-debts/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-05-08T11:27:36+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"2 BANKS AGREE TO ERASE ZOMBIE DEBTS   |  Some of the nation’s biggest banks have come under fire for keeping debts alive on credit reports even when they were discharged in bankruptcy, essentially forcing borrowers to make payments on bills that they do not legally owe, as Jessica Silver-Greenberg of DealBook reported last year. Relief may finally be at hand for the consumers whose discharged debts have kept them from getting jobs or renting apartments, now that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have agreed to update borrowers’ credit reports within the next three months to reflect that the debts were extinguished, Ms. Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook.  The agreement emerged this week in Federal Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, where the two banks, along with Citigroup and Synchrony Financial, formerly GE Capital Retail Finance, face lawsuits accusing them of deliberately ignoring bankruptcy discharges to fetch more money when they sell off pools of bad debt to financial firms. The banks are also being investigated by the United States Trustee Program, an arm of the Justice Department, about whether the banks are deliberately flouting federal bankruptcy law.  In agreeing to ensure bankruptcies were registered on credit reports, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase admitted no wrongdoing. A lawyer for JPMorgan Chase, according to court documents, said that by August the bank would ensure that all debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy were correctly recorded. Bank of America promised to go further by fundamentally changing the way the bank reports all the stale debts that are sold to financial firms. As for the other institutions, a spokesman for Citigroup said the bank has made a proposal “consistent” with what the other banks have proposed.
 
 SYNGENTA REJECTS MONSANTO’S $45 BILLION BID  |  The Swiss seed and insecticide maker Syngenta said on Friday that it had rejected an unsolicited takeover offer of more than $45 billion from Monsanto, its American rival, Chad Bray reports in DealBook. Syngenta said that its board of directors believed that the Monsanto bid undervalued “Syngenta’s prospects and underestimates the significant execution risks, including regulatory and public scrutiny at multiple levels in many countries.”  Monsanto’s offer valued Syngenta at 449 Swiss francs a share, or about $490, and consisted of 45 percent in cash, Syngenta said. The offer valued Syngenta at more than $45 billion and represented a 35 percent premium to its closing price on Thursday. Syngenta’s shares rose 16.7 percent to 388.70 francs in early trading in Zurich on Friday after the company announced its rejection of the offer.
 
 JONATHAN STEINBERG’S REBIRTH  |  Second acts are rare on Wall Street, where the stigma of lost fortunes can linger, so when Jonathan L. Steinberg sold his failing business media company in 2001, his chances of a comeback were slim, Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook. Not only did he have to bear the burden of his own history, but he had to contend with investors’ memories of the failures of his father, Saul, a noted corporate raider whose financial decline attracted wide scrutiny. But the younger Mr. Steinberg, also known as Jono, heeded his late father’s advice — to have the courage of his convictions — and the tiny stock indexing division that the younger Mr. Steinberg pulled from the ruins of his old firm has become one of the fastest-growing fund companies.  In the first quarter of this year, Mr. Steinberg’s firm, WisdomTree Investments, which oversees $60 billion, took in more cash than any other asset management company save for the fund giants Vanguard and BlackRock. “Jono has gone from zero to $60 billion in less than 10 years,” said Michael H. Steinhardt, the retired hedge fund pioneer who took a big stake in WisdomTree in 2004 and remains its chairman and largest shareholder. “That is almost too good.”  Arthur Levitt Jr., the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says the younger Mr. Steinberg shares many of his late father’s good qualities, “and many better qualities on top of that.” And the father is not far from his son’s mind: “I always saw myself running a publicly traded financial services company,” Mr. Steinberg said. “I am the product of my father — doing exactly what I expected to be doing.”

 BRITISH POUND AND STOCKS GAIN ON ELECTION RESULTS  |  The British pound and stocks climbed sharply in London in early trading on Friday after projections and partial results showed that Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative Party won a surprisingly solid victory in the British general election, David Jolly reports in The New York Times’s live-blog coverage of the results. The market reaction reflected relief among investors who had braced for days of uncertainty in the event of a muddled electoral outcome.  Analysts at Barclays said the market cheered “the removal of substantial uncertainties and the likely introduction of policies generally believed to be more favorable to business.” The Barclays analysts said the market rise could be short-lived, however, as investors look toward threats to stability like the Conservative Party’s plans for a referendum in 2017 on Britain’s membership in the European Union. They called the referendum “an event that is likely to generate a substantial amount of uncertainty, particularly if polls fail to show more substantial support for E.U. membership in the coming weeks and months.” The Wall Street Journal’s MoneyBeat blog also rounded up the opinions of top British fund managers and strategists.

133,Bitcoin Exchange Receives First License in New York State,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/business/dealbook/bitcoin-exchange-receives-first-license-in-new-york-state.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-05-07T15:01:24+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"New York State’s top financial regulator has granted the first license to a Bitcoin exchange, allowing it to open legally to customers across the country. The exchange, itBit, said Thursday morning that it was beginning to take on customers in the United States immediately after receiving a banking trust charter from New York State’s Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Benjamin M. Lawsky, who has been trying for some time to bring new rules to the fledgling virtual currency industry. In addition to the new license, itBit, which has offices in New York and Singapore, also announced on Thursday that it had won $25 million in new financing and had appointed three prominent board members: Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator; and Robert H. Herz, a Morgan Stanley director. The trust company charter gives itBit a banklike status and appears to make it the winner in a race among Bitcoin exchanges to become the first to be fully regulated in the United States. “This is a big deal, not just for us, but for the entire Bitcoin industry,” itBit’s chief executive, Charles Cascarilla, said. In the past, several unregulated Bitcoin exchanges have collapsed under questionable circumstances, tarnishing the public reputation of the virtual currency and losing coins worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Earlier this week, an enforcement arm of the Treasury Department fined a virtual currency company, Ripple Labs, $700,000 and said it “willfully violated” the bank secrecy act and failed to report suspicious activity. Mr. Lawsky has been working for more than a year to establish a regulatory procedure to deal with the unusual nature of virtual currencies and the unique security risks that they present. He has proposed a so-called BitLicense and has said he hopes to complete it later this month. ItBit avoided the need for a BitLicense by instead applying for a trust company charter, which appears to come with even stricter regulations. It is the first trust company to be created in New York since the financial crisis. “The technology behind Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could ultimately hold real promise, and it is critical that we set up appropriate rules of the road to help safeguard customer funds,” Mr. Lawsky said in a statement on Thursday. “Indeed, we believe that regulation will ultimately be important to the long-term health and development of the virtual currency industry.” Many Bitcoin companies have been held back by the difficulty of opening accounts with banks, which have been hesitant to deal with the risks of virtual currencies. As a trust company, itBit will be able to be the custodian of customer funds by itself. The process of obtaining the charter has been arduous and expensive and occupied itBit for more than a year. It has already been operating for foreign customers from Singapore. Because of the extensive requirements for opening an account with the company, itBit is planning to focus primarily on larger investors and financial institutions. The company was founded by several people with Wall Street experience, including the chief executive, Mr. Cascarilla, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. The company’s chief operating officer, Andrew Chang, came to itBit from Google. Although the price of Bitcoin has stagnated over the last year, interest in its technology has been growing among large financial and technological companies. Last week, Goldman became the first bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin company when it helped lead a $50 million funding round for the Bitcoin payment company Circle. Many banks are most interested in the financial network, called the blockchain, that allows the Bitcoin digital tokens to be transferred quickly and cheaply. The focus at itBit will be on allowing customers to buy, sell and hold the digital tokens as an asset, like a sort of digital gold. Since Bitcoin was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator named Satoshi Nakamoto, the largest exchanges have mostly been outside the United States. Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, was the dominant exchange for years, but it declared bankruptcy last year and said that nearly $400 million worth of customer coins were either lost or stolen. A criminal investigation is continuing. Mt. Gox was overtaken by Bitstamp, an exchange based in Slovenia. Earlier this year, though, Bitstamp was hacked and lost about $5 million in coins. More recently, a company in San Francisco, Coinbase, said it was opening the first Bitcoin exchange to have all the necessary licenses in the United States. But soon after that announcement, Mr. Lawsky’s office said that Coinbase did not have the licenses needed to operate in New York. The Winklevoss brothers, famous from their legal battles with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, announced their intention this year to open the first regulated United States Bitcoin exchange, but that has not come to fruition yet. Many early Bitcoin users, who were drawn to the virtual currency because of its independence from government, have opposed efforts to win regulatory approval for the technology. But itBit and other companies have said that approach is unlikely to work in bringing virtual currencies into the mainstream. “While some see Bitcoin as alluring for its potential to operate outside this system, we see it differently,” Mr. Cascarilla said in a blog post Thursday morning. “We believe Bitcoin and blockchain technology have immense potential within the system — to help make it more efficient, to offer new solutions and to bring us all into the future.”",0.12045999999999998,0.05867821067821069
134,Bitcoin Comes Out of the Shadows and Into Wall Street’s Sights,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/business/dealbook/bitcoin-comes-out-of-the-shadows-and-into-wall-streets-sights.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-05-01T16:06:29+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"At the end of a panel discussion at the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York this week – billed as the largest such event in the world – a supporter of the cryptocurrency pointed to one of the three lawyers discussing Bitcoin’s struggle for mainstream acceptance. “You all say you want Bitcoin to just work,” he said. “But the only way that will happen is if regulators are completely out of the way.” There’s a fat chance of that with all the attention lavished recently on Bitcoin, which on Wednesday reached a new peak of financial industry acclaim with Goldman Sachs’ first investment in the technology via Bitcoin finance start-up Circle. It’s a sign of a pivotal change. Die-hards like the conference questioner will mourn the lost privacy and edginess of Bitcoin’s geeky existence. The flip side is that mainstream financial industry acceptance is in sight. The digital currency, which emerged six years ago from the computer of a programmer calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto, is entering a new age, one where its future will be guided mainly by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s premier investment bank, and a growing flock of lawyers. This week’s conference nicely illustrated Bitcoin’s efforts to emerge from the shadows. For starters, the panel in question was entitled “Beyond Mt. Gox and Silk Road,” referring to the signature scandals that have largely defined the world of cryptocurrencies in the public’s eye. The former was a Bitcoin exchange that went bust, mainly as a result of incompetence, losing some $450 million. The latter was a dark drug racket that foolishly relied on Bitcoin’s apparent anonymity to cover up its users’ identities. Some panels looked at the mechanics behind Bitcoin, but the most widely attended sessions were about regulation. These had titles like “Emerging Issues in Regulatory Compliance and Law Enforcement Efforts,” “Banking MSBs: A Compliance Officer’s Perspective” and “How to Stop Bitcoin Theft.” If there is to be a grand future for Bitcoin, it will not be as a reserve currency to replace the dollar or yen or as a subfusc network for anarchists, libertarians or mobsters. Rather, it will be as a tool for the financial services industry. “All of us are invested in the price of Bitcoin going up, and you can forget about the price going up and you can forget about mainstream adoption unless regulators get involved,” said Ted Rogers, chief strategy officer at Xapo, a start-up that combines “the convenience of an everyday Bitcoin wallet with the security of a deep cold storage vault.” Mr. Rogers – also a trained lawyer – is betting his career on Bitcoin crossing into the mainstream, “because net-net, a regulated Bitcoin that helps everybody is better than one that operates in the shadows.” To wit, Goldman unveiled its first investment in a Bitcoin business, jointly leading a $50 million funding round for Circle along with the Chinese venture capital firm IDG Capital Partners. Rather than a passive investment, this is a bet made by the Wall Street firm’s principal strategic investments group, a division that puts money to work in start-ups that could disrupt – or in this case, make more efficient – the way the bank does business. Again, it’s not Bitcoin as a borderless currency or a store of value that’s intriguing to Goldman so much as its underlying technology. Every Bitcoin and all users are encrypted with a unique identity, and each transaction is recorded on a decentralized public ledger, known as a blockchain. The Congressional Research Service put it this way in a white paper prepared for United States legislators: This “solves the so-called double spending problem (i.e., spending money you do not own by use of forgery or counterfeiting) and the attendant need for a trusted third party (such as a bank or credit card company) to verify the integrity of electronic transactions.” The application of blockchain technology could be spread across the sorts of activities that Goldman engages in, principally the trading, settling and clearing of securities. First, however, Bitcoin has to become legit. That means “working within the existing regulatory regime and its constraints,” according to Constance Choi, another lawyer who advises digital currency companies and attended the Bitcoin conference. Indeed, 17 of the 26 pages produced by the Congressional Research Service are dedicated to legal and regulatory issues. For Bitcoin pioneers and purists, all of this may be hard to swallow. Acquiescing to federal government watchdogs and hard-nosed bankers couldn’t be further from the original idea. Like it or not, though, that’s where Bitcoin is headed – and where its real mettle will be tested.",0.16745555555555555,0.09822751322751325

That was the big question Wednesday following a report by Bloomberg News that the cloud software giant had hired financial advisers to field takeover inquiries after it was approached by a potential buyer. Unidentified people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News that it was not certain that any deal would be struck, and they didn’t name any possible buyers.   After its stock subsequently rose 11.6 percent on Wednesday, Salesforce now has a valuation of about $49 billion. A takeover of Salesforce would be “the largest ever of a software company,” Bloomberg News reports. Steven R. Koenig, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News that given that Salesforce is not “under duress,” only “a motivated buyer” would be willing to pay a premium for the company.  ReCode posted a list of suitors that could realistically afford to buy Salesforce, and it was very short: Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and Google. Fortune noted that Salesforce has become increasingly friendly with Microsoft since Satya Nadella became Microsoft’s chief executive and that Marc Benioff, Salesforce’s C.E.O., has repeatedly praised Mr. Nadella’s leadership. However, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR & Co., said in a research note on Wednesday that Oracle would be the most “realistic buyer,” Bloomberg News reports. “Oracle is desperate to establish itself as a leader in the cloud, and acquiring the leading cloud company and bringing on board a visionary leader in Marc Benioff would help toward accomplishing this goal,” he wrote.  
 GOLDMAN SACHS BACKS BITCOIN COMPANY    |  Goldman Sachs became the first major bank to give a vote of confidence to the virtual currency Bitcoin by announcing late Wednesday that it had made a significant investment in a Bitcoin-focused company, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Goldman said it would partner with a major Chinese investment firm, IDG Capital Partners, to lead a $50 million investment into Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments.  Bitcoin’s reputation has taken a hit as criminal activity has been linked to the virtual currency, but major financial institutions have been closely examining the opportunities offered by the technology. “While Goldman will not be Circle’s bank, and will not hold any Bitcoins itself, its investment in Circle should help solidify Bitcoin’s reputation as a technology that serious financial firms can work with,” Mr. Popper writes. Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and chief executive of Circle, called Goldman’s investment “a vote of confidence.”
 
 PROGRAMMER’S TRIAL RESUMES AFTER 2 JURORS REMOVED  |  Jury deliberations in the criminal trial of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer accused of stealing some of the firm’s high-frequency trading code, resumed on Wednesday after a judge removed two feuding jurors, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. The proceedings had been suspended on Tuesday when a female juror accused a male juror of trying to poison her and of tampering with an avocado on her sandwich, and the lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, Kevin Marino, had requested a mistrial.  However, Mr. Marino withdrew his motion for a mistrial on Wednesday, and Justice Daniel Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan removed the two jurors after determining that the female juror’s accusation was not credible and that the second juror was unnerved by the incident, which could influence his deliberations.

 SECRET SHUTS DOWN  |  Start-ups fail every day, but the rise and fall of Secret, an anonymous-sharing app, was “breathtakingly fast” even by Silicon Valley standards, Mike Isaac writes in The New York Times.  When Secret was introduced 16 months ago, big-name investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers rushed to buy into the start-up, which focused on the hot issues of privacy and anonymity. But Secret quickly found out that creating buzz was far easier than sustaining it. Secret couldn’t stop the number of its users from falling, and the app was criticized as a tool for cyberbullying. On Wednesday, David Byttow, one of Secret’s founders, said he was shutting down the app and returning money to investors. “They raised a lot of money and had a good reaction initially,” Brian Blau an analyst at Gartner, a research company, told Mr. Isaac. “But how do you build viral growth when the community is anonymous?”   Mylan Raises Offer for Perrigo Again and Is Rejected Again  |  Seeking to fend off an unwanted bid from Teva, Mylan increased its cash-and-stock offer for Perrigo.NYT »

But over the coming decades, as the financial health of the Roman Empire declined — largely because of its increasingly independent army, which demanded ever more money to subdue the rebellious provinces — the emperors began, slowly at first, mixing in copper to stretch the silver further. By 280 A.D., a denarius was 98 percent copper, with a thin silver wash on the surface. The implication was clear to every Roman: Here, in their hands, was a physical manifestation of the empire’s deepening desperation. Whatever proclamations the emperor might make, the coin told the truth. The lesson, perhaps, is that money shapes — and is shaped by — the society at large. And the last century has seen far more transformation in money than any other to date. A hundred years ago, paper money was still just a reference document, the real value hidden away in a vault full of gold. But with the rise of information technology, money has increasingly become an abstraction. We’ve created A.T.M. and debit and credit cards, electronic transfers and 401(k) accounts. Since 1980, computers and deregulation have allowed Wall Street firms to experiment exuberantly with new securities that blur the line between finance and gambling. By the early 2000s, banks were selling securitized mortgage-backed assets as “money-good,” and it was largely this mistaking of junk for cash that brought about the financial crisis of 2008. They do their best to hide it, but today the world’s central bankers are in something like a state of panic. Money is, quite clearly, uncontrollable. This manifests in large ways — like the six years of continuous crisis that have roiled the eurozone — but also in smaller, more technical matters. For example, the Federal Reserve has no idea how much money is out there, at least in all its digital forms, or how fast the overall supply is growing. This is alarming, because the whole concept behind the Fed is to monitor and control the money supply. That was a much easier task in an era of physical banks and highly regulated savings accounts. But today, each of us has the power to increase the money supply by simply carrying a balance on a credit card. (If you ever meet a central banker and want to get her stammering, ask this question: “How much money is there, precisely?”) One way to understand this chaos is to see that power is shifting. The authority to create, move and define money — once confined to central banks and treasury departments — is being dispersed to an odd mix of entrepreneurs, libertarian hackers and old-line banking institutions. Even for the most technologically skeptical, this monetary chaos isn’t something we can choose to avoid. It’s a new and pivotal force in our economy, and it will change the way we work and live. In this Money Issue, we’ve collected four articles that capture ways that technology is changing the very nature of money. Two of these articles are about Bitcoin and Kickstarter — two phenomena that represent, in extreme form, two contradictory aspects of money that have been there from the beginning: total anonymity and rich social context. As a digital form of currency, Bitcoin receives its authority not from a government but from an algorithm that is everywhere and nowhere. It allows for an anonymity of exchange and a creation of value all but completely unmoored from history. Kickstarter, by contrast, calls upon money’s other characteristic: its deeply social nature. It’s impossible to make an anonymous donation to Kickstarter, which is precisely the point, since our donations are often performances of sorts, put on for the benefit of friends or people we admire. The other two articles revolve around technology that seeks to reduce the influence of money or even bypass it entirely. One of them profiles a Silicon Valley start-up that claims its technology can ameliorate some of the precariousness of working life — a precariousness that technology, paradoxically, has helped to create. The other documents how a software engine has enabled a profound form of nonfinancial exchange: a “kidney chain,” in which friends and family of patients with kidney failure, potentially as many as 70 in total, donate in an act of reciprocal generosity. It’s a wonderful example of an algorithm, built on the latest computer science, that allows for the most ancient form of exchange — that is, barter — to save the lives of loved ones. There is a common perception that economists believe money drives human behavior. In fact, it’s almost precisely the opposite. Most modern economics is predicated on an idea first espoused by David Hume in his 1752 essay, “Of Money,” that currency, gold, bank slips, checks and so on are beside the point. What actually matters is what we make and do and feel and want. Money is just an imperfect tool to add it all up, to assign value to our fundamental human desires. We need money only because it, unlike passion, can be stored and traded and counted. Arguably the two greatest economists of all time — Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes — both wrote about money as a way to get at something far more important: who we human beings really are and how we can have the best possible lives. Smith believed that the core desire of all people was to be both loved and worthy of love. Keynes believed the highest possibility of human life came from creating and appreciating artistic works of true beauty. In either case, money is not some separate force, easily divided from other, more human, concerns. Money is changing now, very fast, but only because we are, too.",0.15290666666666666,0.09612177328843995
137,Goldman and IDG Put $50 Million to Work in a Bitcoin Company,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/business/dealbook/goldman-and-idg-put-50-million-to-work-in-a-bitcoin-company.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-04-30T04:01:18+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Goldman Sachs is becoming the first major bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin-focused company, giving a vote of confidence to the embattled virtual currency. The Wall Street bank announced late Wednesday that it had struck a partnership with a major Chinese investment firm, IDG Capital Partners, to lead a $50 million investment into Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments.  Since first grabbing widespread attention in 2013, Bitcoin has been dented by criminal activity tied to the virtual currency and by flurries of speculative buying and selling. The price of one Bitcoin on Wednesday hovered around $225, far below the high above $1,200 that it hit in late 2013.  Even as public interest has waned, however, major financial institutions have been quietly but seriously examining the opportunities offered by the technology, and particularly the new financial network that hosts the Bitcoin digital tokens and allows them to be sent around the world securely, cheaply and almost instantly. A few other Bitcoin companies have recently announced small investments from European banks, and several bank executives have spoken of their interest recently. But Goldman is the first major bank to make such a prominent investment. “Having a franchise like Goldman Sachs as an investor, who has done due diligence, is a vote of confidence,” said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and chief executive of Circle.  The investment is coming from Goldman’s principal strategic investments group, which generally puts money into projects that could have some relevance for the bank’s own business.   Goldman did not comment on the investment beyond a statement from the head of the principal strategic group, Thomas F. Jessop. The statement did not mention Bitcoin, but did say that the firm sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.” Circle, which does not generate Bitcoin, had previously received investments from venture capital firms like General Catalyst Partners and Breyer Capital.   Unlike most big Bitcoin companies, which have focused on making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoins, Circle is hoping to use the virtual currency primarily as a way to cheaply and quickly move money both domestically and internationally.  Circle customers who want to buy and hold Bitcoin will be able to. But for those who do not want to deal with the volatile price of the virtual currency, Circle is preparing to make it possible for customers to keep balances in dollars in an insured bank account. For these customers, Bitcoin will be used only as a means of moving money, to avoid the fees charged by payment processors and money transmitters.   The network underlying Bitcoin is generally a cheaper alternative because it is powered by a decentralized network of computers rather than a single company, like Visa or PayPal, that can extract fees.   The founders of Circle are aiming to use Bitcoin to move into the burgeoning industry of peer-to-peer payments. The industry is currently led by companies like Venmo, a PayPal-owned application that allows friends to quickly send one another money rather than using a check or a bank transfer, which can take days to go through.   While Circle will, in the near future, offer much the same services as Venmo — including free, instant money transfers — the company hopes that Bitcoin will allow it to move money with same ease across international borders, something Venmo cannot do.   The international ambitions should eventually be helped by the participation of IDG Capital, a firm that has backed some of China’s biggest start-ups.   Bitcoin gained popularity as a speculative investment in China in late 2013, but the government there shut down much of the excitement by barring payment processors and banks from dealing with Bitcoin companies. Mr. Allaire said that IDG should help Circle navigate the tricky regulatory landscape in China.   While Circle did not provide the size of Goldman’s investment, Mr. Allaire said that Goldman and IDG had provided the majority of the $50 million.  Circle already had a tie to Goldman through M. Michele Burns, the former chief executive of Mercer who serves on the boards of both companies.   Goldman is one of several banks that have recently written research reports about Bitcoin’s potential. A Goldman report in March listed Bitcoin among the four “megatrends” that are likely to transform payments, which it called a $1.2 trillion industry.   “Although Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are still in the early stages of development, they could gain traction once clear use cases become more established,” the report said.   In the United States, many Bitcoin start-ups have been hampered by the unwillingness of banks to open accounts for virtual currency companies. So far, Silicon Valley Bank has been almost the only American bank willing to deal with companies that hold Bitcoins for customers.   While Goldman will not be Circle’s bank, and will not hold any Bitcoins itself, its investment in Circle should help solidify Bitcoin’s reputation as a technology that serious financial firms can work with.   Many banks have been waiting for more clarity on how bank regulators view Bitcoin companies. New York state’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, is completing a BitLicense for virtual currency companies that is expected to be out in late May.  Circle intends to apply for a BitLicense, and already holds ordinary money-transmitter licenses from many other states.   “Up until now Bitcoin has really been driven by the speculative value phase,” Mr. Allaire said. “We’ve said it needs to move to the utility value phase.” ",0.277808,0.057507099129826406
138,Can Bitcoin Conquer Argentina?,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/how-bitcoin-is-disrupting-argentinas-economy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2015-04-29T11:03:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Dante Castiglione stalked through the doors of a glass-walled office tower on the edge of downtown Buenos Aires, just a few hundred feet from the old port district. In the crowded elevator, he shook his head and muttered under his breath about the stresses of the day and his profession. “I swear, this job can kill me,” he said, his eyes cast downward. On the 20th floor, he hustled into an impersonal, windowless office and quickly removed the tools of his trade from his backpack and set them on the desk: locked blue cash box, cellphone and clunky Dell laptop with the same yellow smiley-face sticker that he puts on all his electronics. Then he unbuckled the fanny pack from around his waist, which contained the most important part of his business: bricks of $100 bills and 100-peso notes. This room, rented for the day, was not one of Castiglione’s regular haunts. He mostly drifts among the old cafes in Buenos Aires, where the bow-tie-wearing waiters serve small glasses of seltzer water with each coffee. In his line of business as a money-changer, temporary meeting places are preferred; they make things harder for would-be thieves, whom he has so far avoided. On this Friday in late February, Castiglione had run around the city in his camouflage-patterned sandals, trying to distribute cash to some clients and pick it up from others. Once back in his temporary office, his outdated LG phone alternately chirped, buzzed and sang with incoming text messages and emails. Ordinarily, Castiglione would have help. His 18-year-old daughter, Fiona, often deals with customers, but she was about to give birth to her first child. Her twin brother, Marco, who used to make cash runs, was now focusing on school. So Castiglione was alone, his stress evident in the sweat on his forehead and the agitation on his face. When his business partner, who lives in Rosario, Argentina’s third-largest city, called to ask why he hadn’t taken care of one particularly insistent client, Castiglione erupted in frustration. “If you want it done faster, you pick up the phone and call her yourself,” he growled in Spanish, before switching to another call. After hanging up, he told me in English: “Everybody wants everything now, and I am just trying to do it. I’m not magical, as people think.” Magical, no, yet something new all the same. His occupation is one of the world’s oldest, but it remains a conspicuous part of modern life in Argentina: Calle Florida, one of the main streets in downtown Buenos Aires, is crowded day and night with men and women singing out “cambio, cambio, cambio, casa de cambio,” to serve local residents who want to trade volatile pesos for more stable and transportable currencies like the dollar. For Castiglione, however, money-changing means converting pesos and dollars into Bitcoin, a virtual currency, and vice versa. That afternoon, a plump 48-year-old musician was one of several customers to drop by the rented room. A German customer had paid the musician in Bitcoin for some freelance compositions, and the musician needed to turn them into dollars. Castiglione joked about the corruption of Argentine politics as he peeled off five $100 bills, which he was trading for a little more than 1.5 Bitcoins, and gave them to his client. The musician did not hand over anything in return; before showing up, he had transferred the Bitcoins — in essence, digital tokens that exist only as entries in a digital ledger — from his Bitcoin address to Castiglione’s. Had the German client instead sent euros to a bank in Argentina, the musician would have been required to fill out a form to receive payment and, as a result of the country’s currency controls, sacrificed roughly 30 percent of his earnings to change his euros into pesos. Bitcoin makes it easier to move money the other way too. The day before, the owner of a small manufacturing company bought $20,000 worth of Bitcoin from Castiglione in order to get his money to the United States, where he needed to pay a vendor, a transaction far easier and less expensive than moving funds through Argentine banks. The last client to visit the office that Friday was Alberto Vega, a stout 37-year-old in a neatly cut suit who heads the Argentine offices of the American Bitcoin company BitPay, whose technology enables merchants to accept Bitcoin payments. Like other BitPay employees — there is a staff of six in Buenos Aires — Vega receives his entire salary in Bitcoin and lives outside the traditional financial system. He orders what he can from websites that accept Bitcoin and goes to Castiglione when he needs cash. On this occasion, he needed 10,000 pesos to pay a roofer who was working on his house. Commerce of this sort has proved useful enough to Argentines that Castiglione has made a living buying and selling Bitcoin for the last year and a half. “We are trying to give a service,” he said. That mundane service — harnessing Bitcoin’s workaday utility — is what so excites some investors and entrepreneurs about Argentina. Banks everywhere hold money and move it around; they help make it possible for money to function as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. But thanks in large part to their country’s history of financial instability, a small yet growing number of Argentines are now using Bitcoin instead to fill those roles. They keep the currency in their Bitcoin “wallets,” digital accounts they access with a password, and use its network when they need to send or spend money, because even with Castiglione or one of his competitors serving as middlemen between the traditional economy and the Bitcoin marketplace, Bitcoin can be cheaper and more convenient than Argentina’s financial establishment. In effect, Argentines are conducting an ambitious experiment, one that threatens ultimately to spread to the United States and disrupt some of the most basic services its banks have to offer. Bitcoin first appeared in early 2009, introduced by a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The software underlying its creation established that Bitcoins would be released slowly and steadily until there are 21 million of them; at that point, more than 12 decades from now, no more Bitcoins will be generated. These rules produced two somewhat predictable results, especially coming in the immediate wake of the financial crisis and the government bailouts of the big banks. The limited and regular release of Bitcoins appealed to libertarians, who have been skeptical of currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. (When Rand Paul announced his candidacy for president last month, his campaign’s website began accepting donations in Bitcoin.) The built-in sense of scarcity also led people to regard Bitcoin as a kind of digital gold, its value likely to increase over time — in other words, something to buy and sell as a speculative investment. The millions of traders, many of them in China, who have bet on the price of the virtual currency have kept the cumulative value of all outstanding Bitcoins well above $2 billion since late 2013. At the same time, that speculative activity has left much of the general public wondering why these virtual coins should be worth anything at all. But the wild fluctuations in price — the value of a Bitcoin has bounced between $70 and $1,200 over the last two years — have obscured a significant aspect of the currency’s broader potential. Bitcoin digital tokens are part of a new kind of online financial network, which runs on the computers of those who use the virtual currency. People who join and support the network — hosting its open-source software, serving as record-keepers of sorts — receive new Bitcoins as they are released in a kind of recurring lottery, thus encouraging user participation. The details of how the network operates can be mind-numbingly complicated, involving lots of advanced math and cryptography, but at the most basic level, the network makes it possible for the first time to send valuable digital money around the world almost instantly, without moving through an intermediary like a bank or credit-card company or a service like PayPal. In a sense, the Bitcoin network was designed to be a financial version of email, which enables messages to be delivered without passing through a national postal service, or like the broader Internet itself, which allows people to publish news and essays without going through a media company. Instead of just delivering words, though, the Bitcoin network makes it possible to deliver money from New York to Shanghai in a matter of minutes without paying any financial institution. The number of Bitcoin users in Argentina is relatively small; it barely registers on most charts of global Bitcoin usage. But Argentina has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only, place where Bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions. A number of large American companies have started accepting Bitcoin payments, but so far there has been little economic incentive for their customers to pay with Bitcoins. In contrast, the best-known Bitcoin start-up in Argentina, BitPagos, is helping more than 200 hotels, both cheap and boutique, take credit-card payments from foreign tourists. The money brought to Argentina using Bitcoin circumvents the onerous government restrictions on receiving money from abroad. Castiglione has some hotel clients, but he says that many of his 800 or so registered customers are freelancers who use Bitcoin to get paid by overseas clients, or companies that want to move money in and out of Argentina. A popular new online retailer, Avalancha, began accepting Bitcoin last summer and has seen the volume of Bitcoin transactions grow steadily since then. Avalancha offers customers a 10 percent discount when they use the virtual currency, because accepting credit cards generally ends up costing Avalancha more than 10 percent as a result of the vagaries of the Argentine financial system. The Bitcoin community in Buenos Aires has been vibrant enough to produce what’s known as the Bitcoin Embassy in the center of the city, a four-story building that serves as the home to eight start-ups whose businesses depends on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proponents like to say that the currency first became popular in the places that needed it least, like Europe and the United States, given how smoothly the currencies and financial services work there. It makes sense that a place like Argentina would be fertile ground for a virtual currency. Inflation is constant: At the end of 2014, for example, the peso was worth 25 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year. And that adversity pales in comparison with past bouts of hyperinflation, defaults on national debts and currency revaluations. Less than half of the population use Argentine banks and credit cards. Even wealthy Argentines fear keeping their money in the country’s banks. Wences Casares grew up on a remote sheep ranch in Patagonia and now lives on an estate looking out over Silicon Valley. He is, as much as anyone, responsible for making Bitcoin known in both Argentina and the United States. In 2001, he sold his first major start-up, a sort of ETrade for South Americans, to the Spanish bank Santander for $750 million. He sold his next big company, an online bank, to Banco Brasil. By the time he first heard about Bitcoin, in late 2011, he was in his first year of his latest start-up, Lemon, a mobile wallet for smartphones, not unlike Apple Pay, which came out three years later. His fascination with Bitcoin had less to do with professional experience, however, than a childhood spent in a country whose financial system seems to be terminally broken. There was rarely a time during Casares’s youth when Argentina was not enduring some sort of financial crisis. In 1983, after years of inflation, the government created the new peso: each new one was worth 10,000 old pesos. In 1985, the new peso, its value eroded by inflation, was in turn supplanted by the austral, worth 1,000 new pesos. Eventually the government went back to the peso, this time pegged to the dollar, an effort that also failed. “I think I understand economics better than most people because I grew up in Argentina,” Casares, now 41, told me. “I’ve seen every single monetary experiment you can imagine. This is the street-smart economics. Not the complex Ph.D. economics.” One particular episode is seared in Casares’s memory. In 1984, during the first significant episode of Argentine hyperinflation following the military junta’s loss of power, Casares’s mother came to get him and his two sisters from school one day. His mother carried two grocery bags filled with cash — the salary she had just been paid. She rushed with Casares and his sisters to the grocery store and made them run through the aisles, grabbing as much food as they could before the prices changed. (An employee walked through the store all day doing nothing but re-pricing the goods on the shelves to keep up with the rapidly changing value of the peso.) After paying at the register, Casares and his sisters ran back for more food to spend the leftover money on. In this hyperinflationary environment, holding on to pesos was the same thing as losing money. Casares is descended from one of Argentina’s old landholding families — a town called Carlos Casares, near Buenos Aires, is named after one of his ancestors — but his branch of the family went through hard times and ended up ranching sheep. When his father sold wool and the buyer’s check took a month to clear, that income could be halved by inflation, forcing yet more household cutbacks. Whatever savings accumulated were quickly exchanged for dollars, which held their value better than pesos. In 2003, Casares and five friends bought a school bus and drove it on a three-week road trip from Buenos Aires, the capital, to Tierra del Fuego, at the southern end of South America. After the vehicle was stolen upon their return, the friends vowed to buy a second bus for another trip. In December 2011, one of them, Jorge Restelli, finally found a bus for 60,000 pesos, or $14,000, in the classified ads. The friends who lived in Argentina quickly paid their shares to purchase and fix it up, but Casares stalled, knowing how much it cost in time and fees to move money from the United States to Argentina. Then Restelli told him that Bitcoin might be just the answer. At the time, the virtual currency had a small cult following in the United States and was essentially unheard-of in Argentina, but Restelli had read about it on an American tech blog. The same day Casares heard about Bitcoin, he found someone online who agreed to meet him at a cafe in Palo Alto and sell him 2,700 or so Bitcoins for about $8,000 in cash. Casares sent Restelli the Bitcoins that evening. Casares was fascinated by the transaction. Here was money that anyone could buy online and that promised to hold its value better than the peso. (That promise would later be tested by extreme price swings.) It also seemed to offer access to the financial system for those who couldn’t open bank accounts or secure credit cards. Even Casares, who created his first start-up in the country, had never held an Argentine bank account. He sent articles about Bitcoin to his bus-trip friends and explained how easy it was to move thousands of dollars in and out of Argentina. One friend went on to found the central Bitcoin advocacy group in Argentina and opened the Bitcoin Embassy in Buenos Aires. Casares began stockpiling Bitcoins, and when he visited Argentina during 2012, he posted offers to sell them on an Internet message board that was becoming a small, impromptu national marketplace for the virtual currency. He organized the first Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina in December 2012, though only a handful of people besides Restelli showed up at the whiskey bar where it was held. By then, Casares was proclaiming Bitcoin’s promise to any Silicon Valley friend who would listen. He had come to believe that the advantages of its network would push the value of each Bitcoin to astronomical values, just as slivers of the airwave spectrum increased in worth as more communication companies sought to use it. In the meantime, each Bitcoin could serve as an easy, secure place to store money, comparable to gold. Many of Casares’s friends in the United States were initially skeptical: What could Bitcoin do that their credit cards couldn’t? But Casares explained how places like Argentina were different. His first big convert among his friends, and the one whose opinion in this area mattered the most, was David Marcus, who had recently become the president of PayPal. Marcus’s light-bulb moment came in the fall of 2012, when the Argentine government ordered PayPal to bar direct payments between Argentines, part of the government’s effort to slow the exchange of pesos into other currencies. As the policy went into effect, and Marcus watched the price of Bitcoin rise against the peso, he figured that Argentines were using Bitcoin to circumvent the government’s restrictions. Marcus began buying Bitcoins himself and also pushed PayPal to start investigating the currency’s use. In March 2013 Casares attended an exclusive technology conference near Tucson hosted by the investment bank Allen & Company. At dinner the first night, Casares won the attention of a table full of investors by describing his childhood experiences in Argentina and how Bitcoin equipped people to avoid similar situations. He demonstrated the capabilities of the Bitcoin network by sending $250,000 worth of the virtual currency to the phone of a table mate, who was then directed to pass the money along to the man next to him with no more than a few taps of his iPhone keypad. During the next two days of the conference, a steady stream of attendees who had seen or heard about the Sunday-evening conversation approached Casares, including Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. On a hike Wednesday afternoon, Casares spent the entire time explaining the concept to Charlie Songhurst, Microsoft’s head of corporate strategy. At the time, Casares was still running his mobile-wallet start-up and had no business stake connected to Bitcoin beyond his own holdings of the virtual currency, which had become substantial. He urged his friends to make their own purchases. On Monday, the first full day of the conference, the price of a Bitcoin jumped more than $2, to $36, and on Tuesday it rose more than $4, its sharpest rise in months, to more than $40. After everyone flew home from the conference, Songhurst wrote a paper and distributed it privately to some of the most powerful investors in Silicon Valley. “We foresee a real possibility that all currencies go digital, and competition eliminates all currencies from noneffective governments,” it said, channeling Casares’s arguments. “The power of friction-free transactions over the Internet will unleash the typical forces of consolidation and globalization, and we will end up with six digital currencies: US Dollar, euro, Yen, Pound, Renminbi and Bitcoin.” The buzz generated by the conference was not the only factor that pushed up the price of Bitcoin in March 2013. A financial crisis in Cyprus came to a head in the middle of the month; the closure of some bank accounts there led to conjecture that Russians were seeking refuge from the Cypriot banking system in Bitcoin. But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100, and that surge generated the first widespread media coverage in the United States and Argentina (some of it, not coincidentally, from journalists cultivated by Casares). The crowd at the next Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina, hosted in April by one of Casares’s friends, was about five times larger than the first one organized by Casares just a few months earlier. Dante Castiglione first heard about Bitcoin that same March. A Canadian who hired him to do some software consulting asked if he could pay him in Bitcoin. Castiglione, who grew up in a small apartment in downtown Buenos Aires, ran his own consulting firm, the latest in a long line of jobs after he dropped out of college. He is a successful version of what Argentines refer to as a buscavida, a person who gets by finding opportunities on the fringes of society, a more expansive career option in Argentina than in most countries. When it came to working for overseas clients, the biggest issue for Castiglione, like many Argentines, was the government-set exchange rate between dollars and pesos. In an attempt to tamp down inflation, the government has long forced banks to sell dollars at artificially low rates. In March 2013, the government said a dollar was worth around 5 pesos. But anyone could go to one of the money changers on Calle Florida and trade a dollar bill for about 8 pesos, the black-market rate, also known as the dólar blue. (Economists and people outside Argentina often regard the dólar blue as the real exchange rate, a closer reflection of the peso’s actual worth.) The official exchange rate was costly for businessmen like Castiglione. When dollars from foreign customers came in through traditional means, banks automatically converted them at the mandated rate, and Castiglione ended up with three fewer pesos for each dollar than he would have gotten by exchanging them on the street. Castiglione had to sacrifice nearly 40 percent of a foreign payment to turn it into pesos. When the Canadian customer paid Castiglione in Bitcoins, Castiglione found someone online willing to meet him in Buenos Aires and pay him in pesos at something close to the dólar blue rate. The demand for his Bitcoins was, in fact, so great that Castiglione, whose company was limping along, began to think there might be a business opportunity there. If he bought Bitcoins for slightly less than he sold them, he could make a profit on every trade, even if the price of Bitcoin didn’t go up. By September 2013, he had become a full-time Bitcoin broker. In-person Bitcoin trading, as Castiglione does it, happens in many other cities around the world. But if this were the only way to procure Bitcoins, the interest in trading them would not have exploded as it has in the United States and China, where exchanging money directly with strangers — without a trusted middleman, in other words — is not a routine part of business. In most places where Bitcoin has become popular, there have been ways to buy the virtual currency online. This, of course, requires cooperation with banks or other payment networks, which happened in the United States and Europe. The American company Coinbase, for instance, allows customers to transfer money from their bank to a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoins online. In Argentina, the banks refuse to work with Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, which isn’t surprising, given the government’s tight control over banks. This hasn’t deterred Argentines, long accustomed to changing money outside official channels. For Castiglione and his company, DigiCoins, this means operating at the edge of the law, but he takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with. Instead of bank tellers and branches, Bitcoin users in Argentina have come to rely on Castiglione and his competitors, some of whom are even willing to make house calls. This financial system developed much more slowly than it has in the United States, where American companies could take deposits from banks anywhere in the country. But as a result, Argentina’s Bitcoin economy is much more resistant to bank policies, government regulations and full-service companies like Coinbase that undermine Bitcoin’s decentralizing spirit. I first met Castiglione when I visited Buenos Aires in June 2014. At the time, he was working downtown, out of a stuffy single room in the same building as a Berlitz language-school office. A joker playing card was lodged in the corner of the whiteboard on the wall. A friend of Castiglione’s son was at a desk, working on the DigiCoins website. His daughter, Fiona, was in touch with customers by phone and online. His son, Marco, was in and out, taking cash to clients, which he carried in his backpack. Sitting behind his own desk next to the door, Castiglione was describing the life of a money-changer, especially when it comes to matters of security. He spoke with tough confidence: “Not many people will like to mess with us.” But he acknowledged that he and his children remained safe largely because they successfully kept their clients ignorant of their location by switching offices frequently: “Right now, maybe God is on our side.” One of Castiglione’s main competitors was another Bitcoin broker named Brenda Fernández. Originally from the Buenos Aires suburbs and a college dropout, she previously smuggled electronics into the country and sold them on the local equivalent of eBay. She talked in loud bursts, punctuated with high-pitched laughs, and proudly made provocative statements about breaking the law and ignoring standard business practices when I met her at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy. “I find a way to market myself as the crazy Bitcoin girl,” she told me. In a more serious moment, Fernández, who is 24, attributed both her attitude and her embrace of Bitcoin in part to the gender transition she made in her early 20s, after years of struggling with traditional gender categories. “It feels good, doing things that you are not supposed to, saying to the structures of power that they don’t have power over you,” she said. After the event at the embassy, Fernández took a small black-and-yellow taxi to a hostel near the National Congress that wanted to exchange about $1,000 worth of Bitcoins. The Rock Hostel, with band-themed rooms, caters to a young clientele. A number of people were drinking beer in the common area when Fernández showed up. The owner, a tattooed 29-year-old named Soledad Rodriguez Pons, had already transferred the Bitcoins to Fernández online, so after a bit of flirting, Fernández quickly handed over the cash; the transaction took place at the reception desk, where a sign offered customers a 10 percent discount if they paid by credit card. On top of the desk, under glass, were paper currencies from around the world. The Rock Hostel is one of hundreds of hotels in the country using the Argentine start-up BitPagos to collect credit-card payments from foreign customers. If Rodriguez Pons accepted credit-card payments from American customers through the usual financial channels, customers would be billed in dollars, and when those dollars came to Rodriguez Pons’s Argentine bank account, they would be converted at the official rate, about 30 percent lower than the black-market rate. It would also take 20 days for Rodriguez Pons to get her pesos. BitPagos helped counter these drawbacks by taking the credit-card payment in the United States and then using the dollars to buy Bitcoins, generally from Coinbase, before sending them to Rodriguez Pons immediately. When Rodriguez Pons needed to pay the rent or laundry bills, she called Fernández or Castiglione — her two standbys — to sell the Bitcoins for pesos at a rate close to the dólar blue. Rodriguez Pons saved so much money this way that she could offer the 10 percent discount for credit cards and still easily come out ahead. In June 2014, BitPagos moved about $150,000 for the Rock Hostel and other tourist establishments, nearly twice what it handled three months earlier. Rodriguez Pons, like many BitPagos clients, knew little about how Bitcoin worked and hadn’t tried hard to figure it out. She once, somewhat accidentally, held onto her Bitcoins at a time when the price was rising, and ended up with a small windfall when she sold. She used the proceeds to build a rooftop bar and a music-rehearsal space. Beyond those extras, Rodriguez Pons credited the savings from using BitPagos with keeping her business alive in Argentina’s very difficult business environment. The hardest part was often reaching Fernández and Castiglione. “I had to call Brenda four times today,” she said with a smile. As anyone who has dealt with Western Union or wired money abroad already knows, Argentina is not the only place that could benefit from Bitcoin’s easier and cheaper way of moving money across international borders. A Hong Kong firm called Bitspark recently opened a shop in a mall popular with Filipino domestic workers, through which they can send money back home using Bitcoin. Another firm, BitPesa, allows customers to convert Bitcoins into Kenyan shillings and deliver them into mobile wallets within Kenya. Transactions of this sort inevitably stir up fears of money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks currently serve as the front line in stopping illicit money transfers. If these regulated institutions are cut out of the business of moving money, the banks and government officials say, who will ensure that terrorists and organized crime are not using the network to move millions across borders? The fact that there is no single authority responsible for supervising the Bitcoin system has also made it easier for con men and thieves to defraud companies holding Bitcoins for customers — something that became clear last year when Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, declared bankruptcy after nearly half a billion dollars of clients’ Bitcoins were fraudulently transferred out of their accounts. (A hacker generally needs only an owner’s password to steal his or her Bitcoins.) Oddly enough, American regulators have actually been friendlier than banks toward the new technology. Even before the advent of Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve was looking into ways to update the relatively antiquated American payment networks, which often take two or three days to complete a simple money transfer. Several different branches of the Federal Reserve have released research papers over the last few years praising the improvements that Bitcoin might spur, even if Bitcoin itself isn’t adopted by the mainstream as a virtual currency. In 2013, when he was chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to a Senate committee studying Bitcoin in which he praised its “long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” Banks are aware that this is an area in which they will likely have to adapt or lose business, perhaps even be made irrelevant. While most of the major banks have criticized Bitcoin and refused to work with virtual-currency companies, many of them are nonetheless spending a lot of time and energy behind the scenes studying the technology. JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank, decided in early 2014 not to conduct business with Bitcoin companies. But it did form its own Bitcoin Working Group, which consists of about two dozen executives throughout the bank who have been meeting fortnightly or monthly to discuss how the technology could change their business. Banks are captivated, in particular, by the ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded: what is known as the blockchain. Unlike traditional financial ledgers, kept by a central institution, the Bitcoin ledger is updated and maintained by everyone on the network, not unlike how Wikipedia is written and monitored by its users. One virtue of this approach is that the network has no central point subject to failure, like Visa and the New York Stock Exchange in their financial realms. It also means there is no middleman collecting fees with each transaction. And because the bookkeeping is publicly accessible, records can’t be manipulated in secret or after the fact. JPMorgan belongs to an association of big banks, the Clearing House, that has been confidentially putting together a “proof of concept” for a decentralized ledger, or blockchain, that would run on the computers of all the participating banks. According to people involved, this network, which is still in the conceptual phase, could allow instant transfers between accounts at all the member banks and eliminate the current risks involved in having billions of dollars in limbo for days at a time. For many bankers, the most valuable potential use of the blockchain is not small payments but very large ones, which account for the vast majority of the money moving around the world each day. The banks, though, are moving slowly, even as several start-ups are trying to use the Bitcoin blockchain to do the same thing on a global basis, cutting out the banks altogether. One of the most recent entrants into this area is a start-up led by a former top executive from JPMorgan. The Federal Reserve has had its own people looking at how to utilize the blockchain technology and potentially even Bitcoin itself. If someone can find a way to minimize the volatility of Bitcoin prices — as many are trying to do — it would be much easier for people to keep their savings in Bitcoin instead of a bank account. “In the long run, Bitcoin will be very disruptive to the developed world,” Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a hedge fund focused on Bitcoin, told me. Things are happening sooner in Argentina, he said, because its financial system creates hassles for the people there. But, he added, “Argentina is just a more extreme example of the situation in every country.” When I returned to Argentina in February this year, the price of Bitcoin had been falling for some time, scaring off many speculators in the United States. There was no sign of waning interest in Argentina, however. Several new companies were trying to provide a more seamless and reliable version of Castiglione’s service. BitPagos had recently started a service allowing its users to buy and sell small quantities of Bitcoin online and was closing in on a million-dollar fund-raising round with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including Dan Morehead’s firm. A new company, Bitex, which had its own office down the street from the Bitcoin Embassy, was focused on using Bitcoin to transfer money among Latin American countries. All of the Argentine Bitcoin companies were working on expanding into Venezuela, where inflation is an even greater problem. Castiglione was so busy running around the city, trying to keep up with the competition, that he was hard to pin down. When we finally met near the Bitcoin Embassy, late at night, he was with a tough-looking friend who was joining DigiCoins to help with the physical deliveries of cash, bringing with him a motorcycle and experience handling large amounts of money. The men had just come back from a trip to a town three hours west of Buenos Aires, where they had sold $20,000 worth of Bitcoins. They had been forced to make the trip at the last minute because another big sale had fallen through, and they did not otherwise have enough dollars to conduct business for the next few days. “If I hadn’t gotten that cash, I was done,” Castiglione told me, before heading out for a last trade just before midnight. Earlier that day, as I sat with Fernández in a Subway sandwich shop, which was her temporary office, chosen for its free Wi-Fi, she did not try to hide her difficulty in adapting to the more competitive environment with her “crazy Bitcoin girl” routine, which was making it hard to keep big customers. She did have one business in the United States that sent her about $5,000 worth of Bitcoins each month and had her exchange the money and deposit the pesos into the company’s Argentine bank account, in order to make payroll. But a lot of her customers were young people who wanted to buy a few hundred pesos worth of a Bitcoin so that they could pay online for a Netflix subscription or a video game. “The market moved in another direction,” she said, “and I didn’t move in that direction.” She had come to have serious doubts about whether Bitcoin would end up being any better than the old system if it was dominated by the ruling class, which would be immune to any popular backlash, thanks to the lack of a central Bitcoin authority. “The key turning point is when the rich elite see it as a way to safeguard their wealth,” she said. Among the people Fernández and Castiglione were both contending with was Wences Casares. He decided in late 2013 that he cared too much about Bitcoin to leave its development to others. He quickly sold his digital-wallet start-up and started his own Bitcoin-centric company with one of the friends from the bus trip, Federico Murrone, an Argentine who was the head programmer on Casares’s past start-ups. Within two months of selling their old company, Casares and Murrone had secured $40 million in funding from investors like Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder. The office that Casares’s new company, Xapo (pronounced “zappo”), opened in Buenos Aires has none of the scrappiness of other virtual-currency players in the country. It occupies a full floor of a building in a fashionable part of the city; amenities included table tennis, glass walls and large, wall-mounted televisions. Xapo initially concentrated on ultrasecure storage for customers who own lots of Bitcoins — it holds the Bitcoins of many of the wealthy tech moguls who followed Casares’s advice. But Casares has ambitions to turn the company into a one-stop financial provider for the virtual-currency industry. The global aspirations were evident from the Hindi-language site that I saw his staff creating. Casares spent months establishing a partnership with Taringa, the most popular Argentine social network. This month, millions of Taringa members in Argentina and the rest of Latin America automatically had a Xapo Bitcoin wallet opened for them. Users will be able to put Bitcoins or fractions of Bitcoins in their wallets by depositing cash at local drugstores, in the same way they pay utility bills. From those accounts, Argentines can pay for things online without a credit card or make online micropayments of 5 or 10 cents for video games and other digital goods (credit cards usually charge a minimum of 25 or 30 cents for each purchase). When I asked Castiglione what he thought about a global venture like Xapo, he evinced a workingman’s skepticism. “We might not be as big as Wences, but the real thing happens here,” Castiglione said, as we sat in his temporary office between client visits. “People get the cash to spend.” Whether his endeavors would help Bitcoin live up to its grand promise — supplanting Wall Street and central banks — was something Castiglione would consider only in the most pragmatic terms. “If people don’t use it, it will go to trash, like anything that isn’t used in this world,” he told me. “If people use it, then it has a future.”",0.16460850202429148,0.08953095393884866

In announcing his candidacy for president this week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky waded into new waters when he said he would accept campaign contributions in Bitcoins, a largely untraceable virtual currency, in amounts up to $100. Interested donors at randpaul.com were given three options for making a contribution: a credit card, PayPal or Bitcoins. While some state and federal candidates in California, Colorado, New Hampshire and elsewhere have started accepting Bitcoins, Mr. Paul, a Republican, is the first presidential candidate to do so. The novelty of the payment method is likely to help Mr. Paul highlight his edgy appeal to other libertarians, tech-savvy voters, young people and others who favor Bitcoins. But it also raises questions about whether illegal contributions could make their way into campaigns more easily. The Bitcoin itself is essentially untraceable if the owner wants to maintain anonymity, and political candidates who accept them must rely largely on donors’ disclosing their identity. Federal law bans contributions to individual candidates from foreigners, corporations or straw donors, among other restrictions, and campaigns are expected to make their “best efforts” to collect and publicly identify donors who contribute more than $200 in a year and to detect contributions that may be illegal. “At some level, we are trusting candidates,” said Richard L. Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. The system already relies on some measure of trust from candidates, he said, “but the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.” In a ruling last year, the Federal Election Commission agreed to allow a political action committee to accept Bitcoins with a voluntary limit of $100, but the commissioners split over how the online currency — which can fluctuate widely in value — should be treated on a broader scale or whether it should be capped. “Bitcoins are no more anonymous than any other contribution,” wrote Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner who was then the chairman of the panel. He said that technological innovations should be embraced in the political system and that Bitcoins should be treated no differently than a computer, securities, a painting or other legal, “in-kind” contributions. But the three Democratic commissioners — Ann M. Ravel, Steven T. Walther and Ellen L. Weintraub — were much more cautious in endorsing the limited use of Bitcoins. Bitcoins should be treated the same as cash, with a cap of $100, to protect against unethical and illegal activities, the three commissioners wrote. “The fact that Bitcoins are ultimately untraceable makes prophylactic measures at the outset of the transaction particularly important,” they said. The commission did not adopt the cap. For Mr. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the government’s electronic surveillance programs as an attack on privacy, his embrace of Bitcoins — with their added layers of privacy — is a way to establish his bona fides with younger voters who put a premium on Internet freedom and technology. “Senator Paul will run the most tech-innovative campaign in 2016,” a spokesman, Sergio Gor, said when asked about the decision to accept the digital currency. “From Snapchat to Bitcoin, we’ll engage in various forums before anyone else.” “This is certainly new territory,” said David Mitrani, a Washington lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law and has represented several candidates who have accepted Bitcoins. “It is traceable, but only if the campaign follows the strict instructions that were given by the commission” for identifying the donor, he said. “If a committee doesn’t implement these strict measures, there’s certainly a concern.” As an experiment, Mr. Mitrani tried to make an online donation of more than $200 in Bitcoins on Mr. Paul’s campaign website — above the voluntary limit that his campaign placed on Bitcoin donations. The donation was rejected. “Bitcoin donations are limited to $100,” the automated response said. “If you would like to contribute more than $100, you may select Credit Card as your payment option and contribute up to $2,600 for the primary election and up to $2,600 for the general election.” Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, became the first member of Congress to accept Bitcoins as donations last year. Mr. Polis said he collected $1,986 in Bitcoins, a tiny fraction of the nearly $1.2 million he raised over all in his 2014 re-election. He said Bitcoins were not only a way to give people another way to donate, but also to show his support for Internet freedom, a cause he has championed. “It’s no riskier than any other kind of contribution,” he said. Bitcoin enthusiasts predicted that Mr. Paul would be the first of many presidential candidates to rake in Bitcoins. “He’s at the forefront of a tech revolution, like the first candidates to have websites,” said Brian Klein, a Los Angeles lawyer and a Bitcoin supporter who has represented many clients involved in the currency. “I bet other presidential candidates will follow his lead, and soon,” Mr. Klein said. “I also believe in a year or two, this won’t be a story because every candidate will accept Bitcoins — just like every candidate has a website.”",0.12587272727272728,0.07059749278499279

It’s a big test of whether stock investors want to jump aboard the crypto bandwagon, despite the volatility of digital currencies. Back story: Bitmain is one of the world’s biggest sellers of equipment used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (A brief explainer: New digital currency tokens are created by computers solving complex equations.) Citing data from the consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, Bitmain claimed in a regulatory filing to control nearly 75 percent of the world’s crypto-mining hardware market. Bitmain’s big break: Soaring interest in cryptocurrencies last year lifted the company’s revenue to $2.5 billion, from $137.3 million in 2015, according to its regulatory filing. Its profit hit $701 million in 2017, up from $38.6 million in 2015. That growth alone is likely to draw interest from investors. But: Bitmain is selling shovels in a gold rush. Its fortunes are largely tied to those of cryptocurrencies — and they have suffered this year. The price of Bitcoin has tumbled nearly 54 percent this year, to $6,491.65, according to CoinMarketCap. And the price of Ethereum, a rival currency, has slid about 26 percent over the same time period, to $216.39. Such plunges could force the company to slash the price of its hardware, hurting profitability. While they have not dented profits for the first six months of 2018, Bitmain warns in its filing that price whiplashes “may adversely affect our business.” (Falling currency prices have also reduced the value of the digital tokens that the company owns.) What to watch: The air of legitimacy from Bitmain going public could buoy the value of Bitcoin and its competing digital currencies. In the longer term, other big cryptocurrency companies may decide to test the public stock markets if Bitmain convinces investors that it’s a safe long-term bet. If it stumbles, expect its peers to hold off.",0.14392,0.03614808802308802

Somehow that creature of infinite detachment emerged as the symbol of incessant attachment here at South by Southwest. In this festival of interactivity, connectivity, sharing and Tinder-ing, the two big stars were Grumpy Cat, who groggily greeted an endless stream of fans, and Meerkat, the live-streaming video app pounced on by presidential candidates eager to seem hip. (The meerkat is actually from the mongoose family.) Animal shelters hosted “yappy hours” with free beer, and Friskies cat food set up the Haus of Bacon, where Internet cat stars took photos with groupies. There was even an attempt to rebrand cats to be less snobby and more in tune with the huggy Internet age. Jackson Galaxy, the tattooed, pierced, catwhispering host of “My Cat From Hell,” on Animal Planet, held a standing-room-only session called “CATastrophe: Good, Bad and Ugly of Internet Cats.” He advised the crowd — some wearing orange cat ears — that, rather than calling cats “aloof,” it might be better to describe them as “free thinkers,” “Zen masters” and “Buddhists.” Galaxy’s attempt to warm up the image of cats was undercut by research suggesting that the only species that seems to show no regret or forgiveness after spats are cats. “I would hesitate to call cats domestic animals,” he told me, adding that he liked the fact that they are not “slavish,” but rather “no compromise” creatures who “kill stuff really well.” The focus on felines made me wish I could roam the festival with Tobermory, the barbed British cat with the “velvet tread and studied unconcern” from the Saki short story. In the 1911 yarn, a member of Lady Blemley’s house party teaches Tobermory, or Toby for short, to talk. Indifferent to the feelings of humans, Toby is brutally honest, exposing the guests’ dalliances, deceptions and foibles. I needed someone like Toby to help me cut through the verbal clutter and Panglossian spin in a world where celebrities are “influencers,” people are “users,” news is “content,” “platforms” are not shoes, the “Deep Web” is no place for Charlotte, and virtual reality trumps plain old reality. Toby would glide coolly past the drones in the Robot Petting Zoo. But he would make quick work of Yik Yak co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, former frat brothers wearing matching turquoise Yik Yak socks for their interview on stage. They tried to push back against criticism that their anonymous, location-based social app used by students is a magnet for crude sexual hazing, bomb threats and bullying: the intimidating “Wild West of anonymous social apps,” as a law professor put it in a Times article. Droll and Buffington said they wanted to create a site that would offer “a level playing field for content,” no matter your race, gender, ethnicity or popularity. They talked about how it could provide lifesaving help on donation drives and showed a sample of innocent “yaks.” In one, a lost girl was escorted back to her building; in another, redheads were praised as awesome. “Do you think we’re so feebleminded that we believe this flimflam about Yik Yak?” Toby would say serenely. “Look at any anonymous comments section online. Even I shudder, and I have claws and highly developed feral instincts.” At a Marie Claire dinner for “Veep” at The Spotify House, I asked Tyler Winklevoss, who is developing a stock market for Bitcoin with his twin brother, to explain the invisible currency. “Bitcoin is Internet money,” he said. “It’s a value transfer protocol.” When I asked about the nefarious Bitcoin transactions in the Internet netherworld, Winklevoss protested: “People use cash every second of the day to do illegal things. Bitcoin is traceable and cash is anonymous.” If Toby deigned to accept the Marie Claire invitation, he no doubt would interpolate: “Bitcoin more transparent? Balderdash! We don’t even know who invented it. It’s Disney dollars for tech nerds.” Then there was my interview with Alex Winter, who graduated from playing Bill in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” to create an Epix documentary about the Darknet, where the Silk Road marketplace operated with Bitcoin, called “The Deep Web.” “It’s like looking under the hood of the Internet,” Winter said, arguing that the Deep Web is “largely used for good” by government agencies, dissidents and journalists. But Toby would certainly beg to differ, scoffing, “It’s a first-rate bazaar for drug dealers, child pornography peddlers, illegal arms salesman and Bitcoin burglars.” If I dragged Toby to the panel with Dan Rather and the former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer, he would twitch at the exuberance of Pfeiffer predicting a Meerkatting “revolution” in coverage. And Toby would put his paws together, as many in the audience did, when Rather advised prudence during this tech “orgy of delight” and insisted that journalists will always be needed to separate the “brass tacks from the bull shine.” Toby would sniff that South by Southwest was more social than media and prowl off to catch up with Judd Apatow. Not one to pussyfoot, Toby would offer his biting commentary as he left: “People at South By are not aiming higher anymore. They are aiming niche. They aren’t looking to do anything larger than themselves. They are aiming to monetize eyeballs in a petty way. They are making even less meaningful social apps and not creating things that are either blazingly new or deeply important to our lives or transformative to society.

Casey, both of The Wall Street Journal, share in their wide-ranging, interesting account of the origin, past and possible future of this virtual-money wannabe. Money was traditionally viewed as a tangible commodity (like gold) or an i.o.u. token of trust for settling debts. Then, out of the blue in 2008, the pseudonymous ­Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the name of both the digital Internet ­currency and its software infrastructure.  “Cryptocurrency” devotes detailed, ­anecdote-filled chapters to the genesis and reception of Bitcoin. Its political ­origin lay in the 1990s anarcho-libertarian community of the Cypherpunks, cryptographers who developed software to ­preserve privacy in the face of snooping Big Brother governments and corporations. How does a purchase with Bitcoin work? Think first about what happens when you pay cash: You can spend a ­dollar bill once only, the transaction is anonymous, and involves no fee.  Now, the book explains, think about using a debit or credit card: No actual dollars change hands, but the bank, a central authority, knows what you’ve bought and from whom, adjusts your balance to prevent double spending and charges a transfer fee.  Bitcoin software ingeniously mimics cash. It allows anyone to transfer ­Bitcoins to anyone else — securely, anonymously and directly — preventing double spending, and avoiding the involvement of a central privacy-invading authority that takes more than a nominal fee. It accomplishes this by means of the block chain, a distributed software ledger on the ­Internet that keeps track of all Bitcoin transactions. The block chain and Bitcoin production are the hardest things to ­understand, and the book explains them lengthily and well. What is a Bitcoin worth? Part commodity (it’s scarce) and part fiat money (of no intrinsic value), it depends on the market, and its price has increased greatly since 2008, with dramatic commodity-like fluctuations. If or as it gets used more widely, its price will stabilize.  The authors enthusiastically cover the pros and cons. If you’re a libertarian, you’ll be glad that governments can’t print Bitcoins, and that you can send them to Julian Assange when Visa won’t. More broadly, Bitcoin can facilitate economic integration of the global poor, the roughly 2.5 billion adults who don’t have bank accounts. Foreign workers remit $500 billion home annually, and Bitcoin could eliminate the fees of 10 percent or more paid to middlemen. Negatively, Bitcoin scandals have ­included crooked or incompetent businesses like Mt. Gox (a Bitcoin exchange that went bankrupt) and the online black-market drug-trading site Silk Road, shut down by the F.B.I. This sounds bad, but don’t forget that HSBC ­recently paid $1.9 billion to resolve charges of money laundering. The authors conclude with a wishfully optimistic discussion of Bitcoin’s future. Entrepreneurs are gearing up. The ­venture-capital firm Andreessen Horo­witz is funding apps such as virtual wallets that allow you to spend Bitcoins easily. Some governments are beginning to regulate Bitcoin, others to ban it. Where will it end? Undoubtedly, easy methods of electronic­ payment will soon arrive. The ­battle will be between centralized — think ­Apple Pay — and decentralized schemes. An anonymized decentralized Bitcoin currency will blur national boundaries and threaten capital controls, exactly what anarcho-libertarians want. But will Bitcoin really bring happiness and liberty? Having observed the unsuppressable libido of capitalism, I’m inclined to think that if Bitcoin succeeds, some corporation will hijack its anarchist roots and make a lot of money the usual way. Meanwhile, Vigna and Casey’s thorough, timely and colorful book is a rewarding place to learn about it all. ",0.105728125,0.10158420138888888

Blythe Masters, who until last year was the head of JPMorgan’s giant commodities unit, is joining Digital Asset Holdings, a Bitcoin-related start-up that is looking to use Bitcoin’s underlying technology to streamline financial transactions. The company, a relative newcomer to the Bitcoin industry, is not a trading platform or an exchange. Rather, it plans to provide software to customers that it says will improve the financial transaction process by making it faster, cheaper and more secure. “We’re not seeking to disintermediate and destroy the current financial system,” Ms. Masters said in an interview on Wednesday. “We’re seeking to make it stronger, better and safer.” Like a number of Bitcoin-related start-ups that have cropped up recently, Digital Asset is not so much interested in Bitcoin as a currency, but in the technology that makes Bitcoin possible. Underlying Bitcoin is the block chain, a decentralized ledger that permanently stores information and is driven by cryptography. Digital Asset intends to allow customers to use the block chain for financial transactions to cut costs and reduce the settlement time. Ms. Masters said she had talks with the Federal Reserve, New York State’s Department of Financial Services and the Bank of England about Digital Asset to determine how regulated financial institutions like banks can use the start-up’s technology. There have also been discussions about whether the start-up itself should be regulated, because it may not fit the criteria for regulation that has been proposed by the Department of Financial Services. That proposal, which is currently waiting for public comment, specifies that companies involved in trading and holding Bitcoins will be regulated. Digital Asset, however, essentially intends to provide a network that makes trading easier, Ms. Masters said. Although Digital Asset is focusing more on the block chain, the news that Ms. Masters, a star at JPMorgan, had joined a Bitcoin-related start-up sent ripples through the virtual currency industry. After all, many Bitcoin supporters have been waiting for someone as well known in the financial world as Ms. Masters to show an interest in the virtual currency. And if anyone could bring legitimacy to Bitcoin and its technology, it might be Ms. Masters, who joined JPMorgan as a college intern about 30 years ago and, at 28, became the youngest managing director the bank had ever had. Later, she helped pioneer credit default swaps, the financial instruments that eventually helped fuel the mortgage crisis. Before leaving the bank last year, she had held a number of prominent roles, including chief financial officer of the investment bank and head of the commodities unit. She announced her intention to leave the bank last April after her commodities operations stopped performing up to expectations. Since its creation in 2009, by a programmer or group of programmers going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a technology and financial industry phenomenon. But most Bitcoin companies lack people with any previous financial experience. What Ms. Masters said she hoped to bring to Digital Asset — and the Bitcoin industry as a whole — was the knowledge that came with her decades of experience in the traditional financial world. “You’ve got a lot of smart people and brilliant technologists and venture capital money flocking into this space with a vision that genuinely represents progress,” she said. “There’s a need for people like me.” She also said she was looking forward to solving problems in the financial markets. “The scale of the opportunity is gigantic,” she said. “It’s also fun to be able to work at the cutting edge of deploying today’s amazing modern technology into worlds where it hasn’t been used yet.”",0.1640625,0.06288949765512265

The United States Marshals Service said on Thursday that 14 registered bidders took part in an auction for 50,000 Bitcoins, worth about $14 million, that were seized in connection with the online bazaar Silk Road. The service said it received 34 total bids, slightly more than the 27 bids it received from 11 bidders at its second auction in December, which was also for 50,000 Bitcoins. The winner or winners of the auction will be notified by 5 p.m. on Friday. The latest auction was for Bitcoins seized from computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in Federal District Court in Manhattan in February on charges related to the operation and ownership of Silk Road. The website was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was an online bazaar for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. The format of the third auction mimicked that of the previous auction in December. Bidders had six hours, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday, to submit sealed bids for the coins, which the Marshals Service had broken into several blocks. The first series contained 10 blocks of 2,000 Bitcoins, while the second contained 10 blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins. Bidders could participate in both series and bid on multiple blocks. The auction generated little of the attention that accompanied the government’s first auction in June, when it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin was enjoying a speculative boom that had sent its price to about $1,150 at the end of 2013. Although the price of one Bitcoin had since fallen, to about $570 at the start of the first auction, investors were still willing to bet heavily on the currency. With the auction, the government also legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of its supporters, fueling a sense of optimism and driving even casual Bitcoin users to participate. Forty-five bidders took part in the first auction. Since then, however, the price of Bitcoin has tumbled. At the start of the second auction in December, Bitcoin was trading at about $370, dissuading many investors from submitting bids. Participation in the auction fell drastically compared with the first auction, raising questions about investor appetite for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is now trading at about $280, up from about $200 earlier this year. But while the Bitcoin frenzy appears to have subsided, the fact that the latest auction had more bidders than the one in December should provide some hope to Bitcoin supporters. One bidder, SecondMarket, an upstart exchange that nearly swept the second Bitcoin auction, participated in the sale on Thursday on behalf of its trading division. The investment firm Pantera Capital said on its website that it would create a syndicate for the auction but declined to comment on Thursday on whether it had participated. In total, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins, meaning it still has a fairly significant amount of coins to sell. Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, wrote in an email that the service anticipated selling the 44,341 remaining Bitcoins “in the coming months” but that “no exact dates have been determined.”",0.057477777777777773,0.05980795610425241

But David Mondrus and Joyce Bayo may be the first to have incorporated Bitcoin. Before about 50 guests at a Walt Disney World hotel in Florida recently, the couple used a Bitcoin automated teller machine to record their written vows on the currency’s so-called block chain — an open ledger that permanently stores information. “A diamond is forever, a marriage is forever, but when was the last time anyone looked at their wedding vows?” Mr. Mondrus said. “This technology allows us to get that data and store it in a way that is retrievable and noncorruptible.” As Bitcoin’s price has declined over the last year, critics have been quick to declare the virtual currency dead. Bitcoin’s true value, though, might be not in the currency itself but in the engine that makes it possible. Underlying Bitcoin — created as a way to make payments directly, anonymously and outside government control — is the block chain, a decentralized database that is driven by cryptography. Explaining how the block chain works can tangle the tongues of even those who are most enthusiastic about Bitcoin. Most resort to metaphors or diagrams. At a basic level, the block chain is a searchable ledger where all transactions are confirmed, in a matter of minutes, by a network of computers working to perform complex algorithms. Each part of the network maintains a copy of the ledger. About six times an hour, a new group of accepted transactions — a block — is created, added to the chain and broadcast to the other parts of the network. In this manner, all transactions are recorded and linked and thus can be traced. It is nearly impossible to modify past blocks in the chain. By simply downloading the Bitcoin software, anyone can gain access to the block chain, search it and submit transactions to the network. Entrepreneurs worldwide are now working to harness that technology for use beyond Bitcoin transactions. The block chain, they say, could ultimately upend not only the traditional financial system but also the way people transfer and record financial assets like stocks, contracts, property titles, patents and marriage licenses — essentially anything that requires a trusted middleman for verification. “There’s a race going on to extend the block chain’s capabilities,” said Adam Ludwin, a co-founder of Chain.com, a start-up that seeks to help developers build Bitcoin applications. On web forums and at Bitcoin conferences, talk is shifting to the next generation of applications built on block-chain technology. So-called Bitcoin 2.0 projects dominated the conversation at the Satoshi Roundtable, a retreat for Bitcoin enthusiasts at a resort in the Dominican Republic in February, according to accounts from some participants. About 20 percent of Chain’s roughly 5,000 users are developing nonfinancial block-chain applications, compared with less than 10 percent a year ago, Mr. Ludwin said. Banks and multinational telecommunications companies are quietly expressing interest in ways to take advantage of the block chain. Investors are also starting to bet on the technology. Through the end of February, Bitcoin companies had raised $550 million in venture capital, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. And although much of that financing has been directed to trading platforms, exchanges and digital-wallet start-ups — $106 million alone has gone to Coinbase, a popular provider of Bitcoin wallets — companies working on block-chain applications are beginning to secure chunks of financing.  For instance, Blockstream — which is looking to extend the block chain’s capabilities — announced it had raised $21 million in November. Ripple Labs, which oversees an online payment system called Ripple, has raised $9 million and is finalizing another round of financing. Among the venture capital firms that have backed Bitcoin-related companies is Khosla Ventures, an investor in Blockstream and Chain. Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla, said the firm’s investments were based on the conviction that the block chain would alter the way society thought about transactions — financial or otherwise. “Anytime there’s a broker — anytime there’s an expert attesting to the validity of something — all of that could be obviated by the block chain,” Mr. Rabois said. “It’s not a guaranteed success, but the upside is so large that as a venture investor, it’s an extremely attractive investment opportunity.” Several start-ups are developing ways to transfer traditional money using the block chain in the hopes of streamlining financial transactions. One such company, Coins.ph, based in the Philippines, has seized on the block chain’s peer-to-peer technology as a way to improve the remittance business and global payments by lowering costs and speeding up transactions. The company’s goal is for people to use its services without having to understand the block chain, much as people send email without thinking about the Internet. “The way I think of the block chain is a really modern infrastructure to move money around the globe,” said Marwan Forzley, the chief executive of Align Commerce, another start-up seeking to make cross-border payments easier. Although companies focused on financial applications for the block chain far outnumber those experimenting with other uses, the gap is narrowing. For example, a start-up called BlockSign verifies signed documents on the block chain. Another company, Filecoin, is aiming to build a marketplace for storing data on the block chain. PeerNova — which said it was planning to announce financing that would bring its total to about $20 million — is developing a technology that will use the block chain to prove the authenticity of a document, like a patent. The company is also toying with registry applications for other records, including title deeds and financial data. “Our entire system of contracts is based on a trusted third party,” said Naveed Sherwani, the chief executive of PeerNova. But with the block chain, he added, “there is no third party anymore.” With the rise of the block chain has come a fundamental question: Should technology replace human discretion? Some experts, even those who study cryptocurrency, are skeptical. “There are very good reasons why we have legal and social institutions and economic intermediaries,” said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who studies block-chain technology. In his teaching, Professor Narayanan said he often used car ownership as an example. In theory, block-chain technology could eliminate the need for, among other inconveniences, title certificates and dealers to ensure the secure transfer of money and property. The idea initially sounds appealing, but if the car is broken into or stolen, he said, the block chain alone will not be able to resolve the dispute. “It’s not just one human you’re getting rid of, but the entire economic, legal and social structure that reinforces the idea of property,” he said. There is also still broad support for Bitcoin. Many investors and entrepreneurs maintain that Bitcoin will outgrow its early role as a speculative investment and become a viable alternative currency for international payments. Others see countries turning to Bitcoin when their own currency is unstable. The virtual currency must also maintain some value for the network to work. Bitcoin miners, the computers that drive the block chain, win Bitcoins if they successfully solve complex cryptographic problems. If Bitcoin’s value continues to drop, it could become too expensive to keep the computers running. But there are also those wary of moving too fast. Though enthusiastic about the block chain’s potential, a group of Bitcoin supporters, many of them early adopters, wants start-ups to focus first on strengthening existing Bitcoin applications, like digital wallets and trading platforms, before developing other uses for the underlying technology. Exchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other currencies, have been especially vulnerable. Anxiety from the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, a prominent exchange based in Japan, is still high. And a security breach in January at Bitstamp, another exchange, sent further ripples of doubt through the Bitcoin industry. “People are rightfully talking about the block chain,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in a number of Bitcoin start-ups, including Blockchain, a digital-wallet provider and software developer, and BTCChina, a Chinese exchange. “The question is how do you realize the first opportunity here?” “You can’t jump to the top of the stairs,” he added. “Everything is a process.”",0.0075562499999999935,0.04641612835948774

The Bitcoin auction, to be held on March 5, comes more than two months after the service’s second Bitcoin auction in December, when it also sold 50,000 Bitcoins.   The latest auction is for Bitcoins seized from the computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in Federal District Court in Manhattan this month on charges related to the operation and ownership of Silk Road. The website was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was online bazaar for illegal drugs and other illicit activities.  The timing of the latest auction comes as investors and even Bitcoin enthusiasts are questioning whether the virtual currency is a desirable investment. In the last year, Bitcoin’s price has slid, from a high of around $1,150 at the end of 2013 to about $235 on Wednesday afternoon. At the time of the second auction, Bitcoin was trading at about $370. The service said 11 registered bidders took part in its December auction.   Bidders in the third Bitcoin auction will have a six-hour period on March 5, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., to submit sealed bids for the coins, which have been broken into several lots. The first series contains 10 blocks of 2,000 Bitcoins, while the second series contains 10 blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins. Bidders can participate in both series and can bid on multiple blocks.  Registration for interested parties to participate in the auction was scheduled to began on Tuesday at 9 a.m., but federal offices in Washington were closed for weather-related reasons, said Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service. The registration period, which began instead on Wednesday, will end at noon on March 2. The Marshals Service will notify eligible bidders on March 3, with the winner, or winners, notified on March 6. To be eligible to participate in the auction, bidders must prove their identities and show that they have a required amount in cash. They also have to certify that they are not affiliated with Silk Road or Mr. Ulbricht. Including 144,336 Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Mr. Ulbricht, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins. After the auction next month, the Marshals Service will have sold about 130,000 Bitcoins. SecondMarket, an upstart exchange based in New York, nearly swept the government’s Bitcoin auction in December, winning 48,000 of the 50,000 Bitcoins for sale. The venture capitalist Timothy C.

Summers took on complex economic policy. On Wednesday night, he took on Bitcoin. Speaking at the Museum of American Finance on Wall Street, Mr. Summers said Bitcoin, the virtual currency that has become a phenomenon in the technology and financial industries, could help reduce costs and inefficiencies in the global payments system. But so could other payment technologies. “We have seen so little innovation cumulatively directed at taking the frictional costs out of the system,” Mr. Summers said. “The notion that there’s going to be a lot of innovation and experimentation around how those frictional costs can be taken out feels like a very important kind of idea.” Although not quite a ringing endorsement of Bitcoin itself, Mr. Summers — who is a special adviser to the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has invested in Bitcoin-related  companies — did say that new payment technologies would eventually become more ubiquitous, like Internet at hotels or Wi-Fi on airplanes. “There will be a moment when they will go from you are struck by their presence to you are struck by their absence,” he added. But Bitcoin or any other payments technology, Mr. Summers said, will need to shed the “hyperlibertarian aura,” which is hindering widespread acceptance. Regulation, he added, would certainly help. “If the day ever comes where Bitcoin counts for an appreciable fraction of commerce that takes place in the world economy, on that day it will be because that commerce is regulated and subject to safeguards and people believe that something other than a mathematical algorithm is ensuring that their money will not be stolen,” he said. But by then, Mr. Summers had made a gaffe. Midway through his brief discussion of Bitcoin, Mr. Summers referred to the currency’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who holds almost mythical status among Bitcoin enthusiasts, as “Mr. Nakatomi.”  There were gasps. But most of the audience nodded along, perhaps convinced that their ears had deceived them, or they simply didn’t know the difference. ",0.16919545454545454,0.028429096156368884

Coinbase, a company based in San Francisco with funding from the New York Stock Exchange and other big investors, said this week that it had opened as the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in several states, including New York. But a spokesman for the top financial regulator in New York said the company did not have the licenses necessary to operate as a Bitcoin exchange in the state. “We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing and will continue to move forward expeditiously,” said Matthew Anderson, a spokesman for Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services. “That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms.” The understanding in Mr. Lawsky’s office is that in order to operate as a Bitcoin exchange or broker, a company would need a money transmission license and would, in the future, need a specialized BitLicense, which Mr. Lawsky’s office is planning to unveil soon, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about the office’s views publicly. In a statement, a co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, said his company “will continue to work” with Mr. Lawsky’s office “on all Bitcoin matters involving consumers, merchants and the recently launched Coinbase Exchange.” He added, “We also look forward to continuing to work together on the completion of New York’s BitLicense.” Bitcoin, a digital currency with built-in scarcity, was started by an anonymous creator in 2009. Over the last two years, companies working with the currency have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investments — with none attracting more money than Coinbase. Last week, Coinbase announced that it had raised $75 million from several investors, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Spanish bank BBVA. There is no indication that Coinbase is facing any penalty for working with New York residents. But any tension between Coinbase and regulators could set back carefully orchestrated efforts in the industry to improve Bitcoin’s reputation with the authorities after earlier thefts and scandals. In addition to Mr. Lawsky’s office, California’s top financial regulator issued a “consumer alert” on Tuesday about Coinbase after news reports suggested the company was licensed to serve residents of the state. “California consumers should be aware Coinbase Exchange is not regulated or licensed by the state,” the alert from the California Department of Business said. A number of other Bitcoin companies have said they were waiting for Mr. Lawsky to issue his BitLicense before trying to open an exchange in the United States. Last week, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss said they were planning to open a Bitcoin exchange in New York as soon as Mr. Lawsky signed off on it. Mr. Lawsky has been at the forefront of trying to impose regulations on the nascent Bitcoin industry, and industry participants expect that other state regulators will act after Mr. Lawsky. Coinbase’s decision to move ahead of regulators is similar to the decisions made by some other California start-ups, which have started their businesses and then sought regulatory approval, occasionally causing tension with those regulators.",0.019373076923076923,0.035067016317016315

Now two of the biggest boosters of the virtual currency, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are trying to firm up support by creating the first regulated Bitcoin exchange for American customers — what they are calling the Nasdaq of Bitcoin. The brothers, who received $65 million in Facebook shares and cash in 2008 after jousting with its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, have hired engineers from top hedge funds, enlisted a bank and engaged regulators with the aim of opening their exchange — named Gemini, Latin for twins — in the coming months. The exchange, which the twins have financed themselves, is a risky bet, given that the virtual currency industry has been a target of hackers and has faced existential questions about its legitimacy. But the brothers are betting that the currency will be able to rise again if it follows the same playbook as the more established financial industry. “Right now we have to build the infrastructure,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “You have to walk before you run.” Since being brought into existence in 2009, by a creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a technology and financial industry phenomenon. Many major Bitcoin companies, however, were founded by people with little previous financial experience. Bitcoins themselves are stored on a decentralized database run by the currency’s users, and can be bought and sold by anybody. The twins have a personal interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed. They amassed a small fortune of Bitcoins, starting in 2012, which has declined in value recently. They also have been working with regulators since 2013 to create the first exchange-traded fund holding Bitcoins, for which they are awaiting approval. They are part of a broader group of wealthy investors and entrepreneurs who have been staking their reputation on the belief that the Bitcoin technology will rise to become more than just a speculative bubble, and will provide new ways of transferring and holding money. This week, an American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, a kind of retail brokerage firm, announced a $75 million financing round — the biggest ever for a Bitcoin start-up — with backing from the New York Stock Exchange and the Spanish bank BBVA. But exchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars and euros, have proved to be the biggest vulnerability for Bitcoin. The first major Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox in Japan, lost hundreds of millions of dollars and went bankrupt last year. Earlier this month, a security breach at another prominent exchange in Europe, Bitstamp, was the latest reminder of the risks, and helped push the price of a Bitcoin below $200 from a peak above $1,200 in late 2013. The Winklevosses themselves were swept up in the scandals when the chief executive of a Bitcoin company they had invested in was arrested on charges related to money laundering in early 2014 — a result of activities that happened before they invested. The twins say none of this has dented their faith in the promise of the technology — they say they continue to hold every Bitcoin they ever purchased — and underscores why a reliable, regulated exchange is needed. “The A Team wasn’t there,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “There was a problem here and it needs to be solved.” The Gemini staff is working at a few rows of desks in the Winklevoss Capital offices near Madison Square Park in Manhattan, which has dry-erase boards on the walls covered in math equations and strategic scribbles, and the requisite bean bag chair. Their chief compliance officer, Michael Breu, was previously at the hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates, where he was head of information security in the research department. At Gemini, Mr. Breu works closely with the chief security officer, Cem Paya, who previously held the same position at the apartment rental site Airbnb. They and a staff of a dozen others have been creating Gemini’s security infrastructure and trading engine from scratch, and already have a test model of the exchange running. They are planning to be ready to open the exchange as soon as they win regulatory approval from New York state’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services. His office has been leading the effort to regulate virtual currencies in the United States, and is introducing what Mr. Lawsky has referred to as a BitLicense for virtual currency companies. He said recently that he hoped to approve the first companies early this year. A person briefed on the matter confirmed that the office was holding discussions on the Winklevoss effort. The twins have brought on a leading law firm on financial regulations, Katten Muchin Rosenman, to help win regulatory approval. Their close cooperation with regulators has also helped them win the thing that has proved the most elusive for Bitcoin companies — a bank account with an American bank. According to documents viewed by The New York Times, on condition that only their general outline be described in this article, the Winklevosses have an agreement with a bank chartered in New York to handle the dollars moving in and out of customer accounts. Cooperation with regulators has divided the virtual currency world. Bitcoin was founded, in part, with the intention of creating a currency outside the control of governments. The twins have placed themselves firmly in the camp of those who believe that Bitcoin will survive only if it has regulatory oversight. “Our philosophy is to ask for permission, not forgiveness,” Cameron Winklevoss said. The biggest Bitcoin exchanges today are all overseas, in China, Hong Kong, London and Eastern Europe, which has not helped instill confidence in some American users. Most of the exchanges were started at an earlier point in Bitcoin’s development when there was less focus on security and regulations. Bitcoins are particularly vulnerable to hackers because all that someone needs to spend the money in a Bitcoin account is the password, or private key. The security experts hired by the Winklevoss twins have, like many Bitcoin companies, been focusing on ways to keep the private keys — a mix of letters and numbers — in multiple locations where they are offline and physically guarded. For the actual trading software, the twins brought on a programmer from the hedge fund Two Sigma, who is building a system that can be used by both small investors and institutional firms that want direct access to the trading system. The twins are also still moving forward with their exchange-traded fund, set to trade on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker COIN when approved. All of these ventures could amount to nothing if the recent decline in confidence continues. The last major Bitcoin start-up the brothers backed, BitInstant, collapsed in the summer of 2013 before the founder was arrested. After seeing the mistakes made by others, the twins said they wanted to do things on their own. “This time around we are betting on ourselves,” Tyler Winklevoss said.

The announcement of the funding, led by DFJ Growth, could not have come at a better time for Bitcoin, whose price has plunged in recent months. Bitcoin proponents will probably seize upon Coinbase’s latest funding round as a vote of confidence in the virtual currency and its underlying technology. “If we thought there was a huge risk of Bitcoin going away, we obviously wouldn’t have made this investment,” said Barry Schuler, a managing director at DFJ Growth, who led the fund’s investment in Coinbase. Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, sounded an equally optimistic tone. “Investors still have a pretty high conviction on Bitcoin despite what the spot price of Bitcoin is doing,” he said. “This really is people putting their money where their mouth is in terms of betting on Bitcoin as a technology trend.” Coinbase, based in San Francisco, said it had completed its financing round by the middle of December, before the latest shock to Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin is now trading at about $210, from a peak of roughly $1,200 at the end of 2013. In total, Coinbase has collected over $105 million in venture capital. Andreessen Horowitz, which led a $25 million investment round in Coinbase in December 2013, also participated in Coinbase’s most recent fund-raising, along with existing investors Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. With its latest financing round, Coinbase has also received a nod from the established financial sector. New investors in Coinbase include the New York Stock Exchange, the financial services firm USAA and the Spanish bank BBVA. Vikram S. Pandit, a former chief executive of Citigroup, and Thomas H. Glocer, a former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, also invested in the round. Since its last round of financing in 2013, Coinbase has led the industry in helping merchants, including Dell and Overstock, integrate Bitcoin into their payment systems. It has also extended access to customers in 18 European countries. Still, Bitcoin is a long way from mainstream adoption. A prolonged price slump has invigorated skeptics, putting Bitcoin supporters on the defensive. And while many investors and virtual currency entrepreneurs have publicly shrugged off the effects — psychological and otherwise — of Bitcoin’s downward spiral, there is nevertheless a sense of anxiety percolating through the industry. Bitcoin miners, for instance, are struggling to pay for the huge amount of electricity required to keep the Bitcoin network running. As Bitcoin’s price has dropped, prominent Bitcoin enthusiasts have loudly voiced their support for the Bitcoin’s technology, dismissing attention on the decline as unsophisticated and misplaced. In early January, for instance, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen shared his thoughts on Bitcoin in a series of tweets.  “In the short run, Bitcoin is still highly useful as a transaction and trust network in many use cases even with high volatility,” he wrote. “The price of BTC has very little to do with the level of creativity of thinking that’s going into new Bitcoin apps, or their usefulness.” For now, Coinbase’s business model appears to rely heavily on people wanting to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. The company said it was planning to expand to more countries — it hopes to extend access to 30 by the end of the year — and bring on more merchants. It also intends to improve its platform for developers and enhance its mobile technology. Coinbase now hosts 2.1 million consumer wallets, up from 600,000 at the end of 2013. The company said 38,000 merchants use its payments tools. But Coinbase’s ties to Bitcoin as a currency, which so far have been its most accessible use case, is part of its appeal, Mr. Schuler of DFJ Growth said. “You have to have a feel for how to engage consumers,” he said. “That’s the real spark you see with these guys.”",0.21682727272727273,0.08960858585858587

Shares of New Age Beverages, Alkaline Water and IntelGenx Technologies have all soared in recent weeks, Bloomberg reports. What do the three companies have in common? Not much, other than their plans to tap “the emerging legal cannabis market.” If that sounds familiar, it may be because something similar happened with Bitcoin at the end of last year. “Companies previously focused on making fitness apparel, cigars and beverages, among other things, have rebranded themselves as virtual currency or blockchain companies of one sort or another. And investors have cheered them on, pushing their stock prices up,” Nathaniel Popper wrote then in The New York Times. Square is on quite a run. The payment company’s stock jumped 10 percent to a record high Tuesday after the company said it was rolling out a mobile app to help businesses manage their payroll. Shares of Square are up 960 percent since its initial public offering at the end in 2015. The company, founded by Jack Dorsey, has a market value nearly double that of Twitter, the other company Mr. Dorsey runs. Markets risk ignoring the yield curve at their own peril, warned Beth Ann Bovino, S & P Global’s chief economist for the United States. The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted — when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates — a recession has soon followed. For much of 2018, the spread has hovered around its narrowest level in more than a decade, and many believe it is likely to invert next year. But a debate has raged about whether the yield curve has lost its predictive power. “As has happened in the past when the yield curve nears inversion territory, people are questioning whether the historically robust indicator has now lost its edge,” Ms. Bovino wrote. “However, we still have a certain respect for the historical performance of the yield-curve indicator, and we hope that the Fed doesn’t test inversion too far.” The escalating trade war has not cooled investor demand for Chinese securities. Foreign ownership of Chinese stocks and bonds has grown 64 percent over the past year, according to Z-Ben Advisors. Access to China’s markets and its economy has been a key issue in the country’s trade dispute with the United States.

The virtual currency is down 33 percent against the dollar in 2015, and 71 percent in the last year. There is almost certainly more bad news to come. The electronic token has lots of enduring problems. As a store of value that is not subject to government intervention, it lacks the support of authorities and is always in danger of being banned. The market was illiquid to begin with and is becoming even more so, increasing the risk of abuse. Bitcoins generate no income, so they count as collectibles – more like artwork than a few shares of Google. In these matters, beauty and value depend on the fickle eyes of the beholder and potential buyer. Anonymity and free transactions offer some allure. But the former leads to an association with illegal activity. The latter is an illusion, since someone has to pay for the computers used to process and store Bitcoin information. Bitcoin “miners” provide the service in exchange for new Bitcoins. Right now, the biggest problem is psychology. In a more ebullient and inflationary world, the novelty and limited supply of Bitcoins might appeal. These days, disinflation and discontent are the dominant themes. Bitcoins touched $171.41 last Wednesday and on Friday traded at $216. At these levels, the economics of Bitcoin mining look terrible. Full cost of production is closer to $600 a token, based on a recent study by the Australian researcher Hass McCook. If miners retreat, users may end up paying directly for the service. Defenders of Bitcoin have not given up hope. Their emphasis has shifted though, from the currency to the underlying blockchain processing software. That may be a good investment. It may even be revolutionary. But it will not bring up the price of Bitcoin. The currency is suffering an erosion of confidence from which it could be hard to recover.

A federal agent said on Thursday in the trial of Ross W. Ulbricht in Manhattan that he became convinced in 2012 and 2013 that the person behind the Silk Road website was actually Mark Karpeles, the Tokyo-based owner and operator of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange.  Bitcoin is the virtual currency that was used by tens of thousands of people to buy drugs anonymously on Silk Road, a site that existed only on a hidden part of the Internet. Mr. Karpeles’s company handled more than 80 percent of the world’s Bitcoin trading, and the agent acknowledged he believed that Mr. Karpeles saw Silk Road as a way to “drive the price up.” The revelation that Mr. Karpeles, who was not charged, had been a leading suspect in the Silk Road investigation was an unexpected turn in the trial of Mr. Ulbricht, 30, of San Francisco, who was arrested in October 2013 and accused of running the website.  Mr. Ulbricht faces narcotics trafficking conspiracy and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, had acknowledged in court that Silk Road was his client’s idea, but said that Mr. Ulbricht had handed the enterprise off to others after several months and suggested that it was run by someone else under the screen name Dread Pirate Roberts. The testimony by the agent, Jared Der-Yeghiayan of the Department of Homeland Security, that Mr. Karpeles and an associate had become targets of the investigation was elicited under cross-examination by Mr. Dratel. “Did you not say that you believed him to be the mastermind behind keeping the website secure and operating?” Mr. Dratel asked, referring to Mr. Karpeles. “He had the credentials to do so, yes,” Mr. Der-Yeghiayan replied. “But did you not say that?” “I would have said that, yes,” the agent said. Mr. Der-Yeghiayan said that in August 2013, he took steps to prepare a search warrant for Mr. Karpeles’s emails, saying there was probable cause to believe they contained evidence of narcotics trafficking and money laundering.  Mr. Karpeles, asked for comment, denied in an email on Thursday that he was Dread Pirate Roberts.  “I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I can only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything he can to point the attention away from his client,” he said. “I have nothing to do with Silk Road,” he added, “and do not condone what has been happening there.”  The cross-examination appeared intended to raise doubt in jurors’ minds about whether the right man was on trial. Mr. Dratel had told the jury that his client was “lured back” into Silk Road after the real Dread Pirate Roberts learned that he was under investigation and made Mr. Ulbricht the “perfect fall guy.” Mr. Karpeles had long been one of the most mysterious figures in the lucrative virtual currency industry that sprung up around Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The first exchange that allowed Bitcoins to be easily bought and sold was Mt. Gox, which Mr. Karpeles bought in early 2011, about the same time Silk Road came into existence. Despite facing several security breaches and other hurdles, Mr. Karpeles built Mt. Gox into the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, with tens of millions of dollars trading hands on some days.  But in early 2014, Mr. Karpeles unexpectedly announced that his company had lost nearly all of the Bitcoins it held for customers, which were worth around $500 million at the time, and filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Der-Yeghiayan’s team began tracking Mr. Karpeles in 2012. In May 2013, a separate investigation being run out of the Department of Homeland Security’s Baltimore offices seized bank accounts that Mt. Gox had in the United States, holding almost $10 million.

Bitcoin’s price dropped on Tuesday to about $224, from $267, according to CoinDesk, below where it was in April 2013 before Bitcoin gained widespread traction and started to soar in price. It reached its peak of about $1,200 in December of that year. Since then, however, prices have slumped even as transactions have increased. With no signs of a rally in the offing, the industry is bracing for the effects of a prolonged decline in prices. In particular, Bitcoin mining companies, which are essential to the currency’s underlying technology, are flashing warning signs. “Will people lose confidence? Absolutely,” said Greg Schvey, a partner at TradeBlock, which provides data on virtual currency. Bitcoin had regained some of its losses on Tuesday afternoon to trade at about $235. For the most part, Bitcoin supporters are quick to dismiss the currency’s yearlong slide, saying the price — and the volatility — is only one aspect of the virtual currency. Paying attention to price, they say, ignores the importance of Bitcoin’s underlying technology, which is agnostic to its market value. Still, the industry is starting to feel the effects of the sustained decline. Some mining companies that invested heavily in resources when the price of Bitcoin was rising are struggling to keep their operations open. “It obviously makes the environment for Bitcoin businesses difficult,” said Jonathan Levin, a digital currency consultant. Bitcoin miners are computers that run Bitcoin’s open-source program and perform complex algorithms. If they find the solution before other miners, they are rewarded with a block of 25 Bitcoins — essentially “unearthing” new Bitcoins from the digital currency’s decentralized network. Such mining operations, though potentially lucrative, are also expensive, requiring huge amounts of equipment and electricity. Now, these miners, who had bet on a higher price of the virtual currency to pay for resources, are selling their Bitcoins to keep their electricity running and return money to their lenders. “People have these very real fiat-based liabilities that they have to pony up for, and to do that, they’re going to have to sell Bitcoins,” Mr. Schvey of TradeBlock said. These sales could in turn be driving down the price further. One company, CEX.io, said on Monday that it had temporarily shut down its cloud mining operations, a move driven in part by decline in Bitcoin’s price. “Taking into consideration our users’ interests, the recent Bitcoin price drop, as well as the upscaling of the mining difficulty, CEX.io Bitcoin exchange would like to announce a temporary suspension of cloud mining services provided by the platform at the time of the next difficulty increase,” the company wrote in a blog post. And CoinTerra, a mining start-up based in Texas, is being sued in Utah by C7 Data Centers, a data center operator, accusing it of breach of contract over  $1.4 million in owed payments, according to a court filing. “CoinTerra disputes the allegations in the complaint filed by C7 Data Centers in Utah State court,” CoinTerra said in a statement. “Moreover, CoinTerra has filed a counterclaim against C7 in federal court in the District of Utah. CoinTerra intends to vigorously prosecute its claims against C7 while defending the claims levied by C7.” CoinDesk reported last week that emails sent by CoinTerra to customers of its cloud mining business suggested that the company had defaulted on its debt obligations. Other Bitcoin start-ups, especially those dependent on price, may also be feeling the squeeze. And if the price continues to fall, investors may turn away from Bitcoin companies, Mr. Levin said. Even as the price of Bitcoin declines, sentiment still appears to be positive. Pantera Capital’s BitIndex, a measure of Bitcoin’s medium-term prospects, is up 1 percent from last week. And in the last year, the number of transactions has increased significantly. “At the end of the day, what will be determinative of Bitcoin being a success or failure is going to be whether people are using it,” said Patrick Murck, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation. “The day-to-day stuff with the price is kind of a side show.”",0.03334,0.02408261183261183

Gox, once its most prominent exchange. On Tuesday morning, Bitstamp, based in London, posted a message on its website saying it had “temporarily suspended Bitstamp services” and urged its customers not to make deposits to previously issued Bitcoin deposit addresses. The exchange said that some of its virtual wallets were compromised on Sunday and that it had lost roughly 19,000 Bitcoins, worth about $5 million. In its message, Bitstamp sought to reassure customers and prevent the sort of panic that ensued last February, when news of a major theft at Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, roiled the Bitcoin world. “Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their Bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9 a.m. UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full,” Bitstamp wrote. “This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total Bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems,” the exchange added. “We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.” On Monday, after Bitstamp issued the first message on its website that it was temporarily suspending services “in an excess of caution,” Nejc Kodric, the exchange’s chief executive, issued an apology on Twitter. “My sincerest apologies to those who are affected by our service being temporary suspended,” he wrote. Later, he added, “Thank you all for your patience, we are working diligently to restore service and hope to have an E.T.A. later today.”  Bitstamp’s lost Bitcoins are only a tiny percentage of the nearly 14 million Bitcoins in circulation. But the breach provided a stark reminder that the Bitcoin industry is still grappling with its image as a plaything of hackers and ne’er-do-wells intent on exploiting the digital currency and the places where it is traded and stored.  “Bitstamp has become a key part of the Bitcoin ecosystem as one of the most trusted and liquid exchanges,” Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email. “Many market participants have accounts at Bitstamp and rely on its listed prices for their operations. The issues at Bitstamp are hampering activity for the Bitcoin market as it works through these issues.” “I believe this is yet another sign of the need for regulated, secure, liquid U.S.-based exchanges to create a more robust infrastructure for Bitcoin trading,” he added. Last February, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection after going dark some days earlier. At the time, the exchange said it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins and more than 100,000 of its own coins, worth about $500 million at the time.  The event pushed many government agencies to take the regulation of Bitcoin more seriously. Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of New York State’s Department of Financial Services, for instance, has cited the collapse of Mt. Gox as a driving force behind his office’s proposed virtual currency regulations, which were introduced in July. Since Mt. Gox closed, the price of Bitcoin has dropped by about half. It is now trading around $270, according to CoinDesk. News that Bitstamp had suspended services did not appear to have significantly affected the currency’s price. Bitstamp is far from the biggest Bitcoin exchange, representing 6 percent of Bitcoin transactions, according to Bitcoin Charts, which provides data related to the Bitcoin network.  Still, Reddit users on Monday posted a flurry of warnings that Bitstamp was down and speculated that the cause was theft. One user posted that he had foreseen problems at Bitstamp five months ago. “I have nightmares of Mt. Gox all over again,” the user wrote.",0.012927272727272737,0.08008379247015611

It popped up on her computer screen soon after she’d discovered that all of her files had been locked. “Your files are encrypted,” it announced. “To get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD.” If my mother failed to pay within a week, the price would go up to $1,000. After that, her decryption key would be destroyed and any chance of accessing the 5,726 files on her PC — all of her data — would be lost forever. Sincerely, CryptoWall. CryptoWall 2.0 is the latest immunoresistant strain of a larger body of viruses known as ransomware. The virus is thought to infiltrate your computer when you click on a legitimate-looking attachment or through existing malware lurking on your hard drive, and once unleashed it instantly encrypts all your files, barring access to a single photo or tax receipt. Everyone has the same questions when they first hear about CryptoWall: Is there any other way to get rid of it besides paying the ransom? No — it appears to be technologically impossible for anyone to decrypt your files once CryptoWall 2.0 has locked them. (My mother had several I.T. professionals try.) But should you really be handing money over to a bunch of criminals? According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, this answer is also no. “Ransomware messages are an attempt to extort money,” one public service announcement helpfully explains. “If you have received a ransomware message do not follow payment instructions and file a complaint.” Right. But that won’t get you your files back. Which is why the Sheriff’s Office of Dickson County, Tenn., recently paid a CryptoWall ransom to unlock 72,000 autopsy reports, witness statements, crime scene photographs and other documents. Finally, can law enforcement at least do something to stop these attacks in the future? Probably not. Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn’t finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them. By the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally — the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn’t the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay. Only, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins. Picture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures. She’d managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin “wallet” provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin’s price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. (Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That’s where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, not too far from where I lived. The Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not. Inside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. “Balance query in progress,” it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe’s voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain. The fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M. We got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting role of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn’t like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their “fast, simple service.” That’s how my mom found out about Coin Cafe — from her ransom note. This referral is only one of the handy services CryptoWall provides to ensure a more seamless customer experience. Others include the ability to “decrypt one file for free” and a message interface one can use “in case of any problems with payment or having any other questions.” What next, I wondered. Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials? “I THINK they like the idea they don’t have to pretend they’re not criminals,” Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. “By using the fact that they’re criminals to scare you, it’s just a lot easier on them.” They don’t have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance. In addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of “a very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.” It’s also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus. Even after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as “the largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet” and “an enormous danger for computer users,” I still couldn’t help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher. So what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and “patch” alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.) Of course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words. So she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived. When I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. “That is great news, truly!” he wrote. “Whoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.” But Mr. Wisniewski had a more pragmatic take. “From what we can tell, they almost always honor what they say because they want word to get around that they’re trustworthy criminals who’ll give you your files back.” Welcome to the new ransomware economy, where hackers have a reputation to consider.",-0.006008139534883724,0.05222969171224985

Mr. Harper’s last day was Wednesday, though he received notice of the foundation’s decision shortly after Thanksgiving. Mr. Harper’s dismissal comes as the Bitcoin Foundation is shifting its focus, from policy advocacy to Bitcoin technology and infrastructure development.  “We’re changing direction a little bit here,” said Patrick Murck, the foundation’s executive director.  “The policy aspect was more of a distraction and a drain on resources that we could handle at the moment,” he added. “Without having that work to be done, there really wasn’t a huge role for Jim to do.” Before joining the Bitcoin Foundation, Mr. Harper served as director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group. He will remain at Cato as a senior fellow, a reduced role he took when he moved to the Bitcoin Foundation. For his part, Mr. Harper said he wasn’t quite ready to cut all ties to the Bitcoin Foundation, despite a difference of opinion on the foundation’s direction. In an interview, Mr. Harper said he was still running for a position on the foundation’s board.  Mr. Harper is running for election alongside a number of other Bitcoin enthusiasts, including Cody Wilson, who has opposed Bitcoin regulation and told the Upstart Business Journal that he was running “on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation.” The board election will take place in mid-February. “My experience at the foundation was that it wasn’t an organization that had a lot of focus and direction,” Mr. Harper said in an interview. “Part of the reason I’m running for the board is because, whether I work there or not, I think the Bitcoin Foundation should have solid leadership and management from the top all the way down.” When Mr. Harper joined the Bitcoin Foundation last year, regulators across the globe were grappling with how to treat virtual currency. At the time, Bitcoin supporters were reeling from the collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the biggest online Bitcoin exchanges. Mt. Gox had filed for bankruptcy protection after announcing that nearly 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins, worth close to $500 million, had gone missing. Only months earlier, the online bazaar Silk Road, which was seen as a marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit goods, had been shut down by federal authorities. Now, however, Bitcoin appears in many ways to have shed its image as an outlaw currency.  Bitcoin supporters had been concerned with legitimizing the virtual currency to law enforcement, regulators and the public. But buoyed by clearer regulatory frameworks and the success of recent events — like the federal government’s two Bitcoin auctions — some supporters are turning their attention to Bitcoin’s core software development with the hopes of easing widespread adoption.   “There’s little doubt that we added tremendous value to the community by properly framing the conversation and building bridges for the Bitcoin community to engage directly with the regulators,” the Bitcoin Foundation wrote in a blog post last month about its new focus. “Others have followed and established policy organizations with clear and focused missions, a development that gives us the opportunity to focus on supporting Bitcoin Core and building the technical infrastructure needed to grow the Bitcoin network.” Still, Mr. Murck, who replaced Jon Matonis, one of the foundation’s founding board members, as executive director in October, praised Mr. Harper’s role in the foundation’s early policy initiatives but reiterated that their views on the foundation’s goals had diverged. “I think Jim disagrees with the focus,” Mr. Murck said. “I would hope that at a personal level, it’s still amicable.”",0.10735428571428572,0.04778294853294853

Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state’s top financial regulator, outlined revisions to the state’s highly anticipated “BitLicense” proposal on Thursday, providing the most detail yet on rules that, when finalized, could reshape the virtual currency industry.  Although far from sweeping, the revised rules will address or eliminate many of the aspects that opponents had criticized for being vague or strict, including the types of companies that would be subject to the rules, Mr. Lawsky said in keynote remarks at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Lawsky said his office, the Department of Financial Services, would publish the revised rules “in the coming days,” after which the public will have 30 days to submit comments. He said he hoped to finalize regulations by early next year. The original BitLicense plan — the first attempt by a state to regulate virtual currency companies — included rules on consumer protection, capital requirements, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. The proposal stipulated that the rules would pertain to Bitcoin exchanges and companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers.  Bitcoin enthusiasts have wavered on whether the regulations, first introduced in July, would help legitimize the virtual currency or whether they would curb innovation. Some cite the impending regulations as a chief reason the virtual currency appears to have lost momentum.  Many in the Bitcoin industry, for instance, have complained that the language in the proposal left the door open for the government to regulate companies that were only tangentially involved with digital currency.  In response, Mr. Lawsky said the new rules clarified that software developers and Bitcoin miners would not need to apply for operating licenses. Customer loyalty programs, rewards and gift cards denominated in fiat currency would also not be subject to the BitLicense requirements. Start-ups had also expressed concern about the cost of compliance, which they said could discourage young companies. To address these complaints, Mr. Lawsky said, the revised regulations will offer a two-year transitional BitLicense for companies that “are unable to satisfy all of the requirements of a full license.” Such transitional licenses are meant for start-ups and small businesses, he said. “That transitional BitLicense will help provide start-ups an on-ramp as they build up their operations,” Mr. Lawsky added.  Moreover, Mr. Lawsky said that companies would no longer be required to obtain the addresses and transaction data for all parties to a transaction. Opponents to the original proposal had complained that this rule would be particularly onerous while also running counter to the whole idea of anonymity that attracts many supporters to Bitcoin. Instead, Mr. Lawsky said that virtual currency companies would only need to obtain such information for their own customers or account holders and, when possible, for counterparties to the transaction.  From the beginning, Mr. Lawsky has emphasized that the virtual currency rules were intended to inspire consumer confidence and promote commerce. He acknowledged, however, that Bitcoin was nowhere near the powerful financial force its supporters hope it will one day become. “Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are a very, very long way from being a credible challenger to banks or the existing payments system,” Mr. Lawsky said. “But I think virtual currency could eventually cause some amount of self-reflection in the legacy financial system.”",0.126334375,0.05964251893939394

Like many companies that have started accepting Bitcoin, Time Inc. has teamed up with Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin wallet, to process the transactions.  “This pilot program will give Bitcoin users a seamless and simple way to purchase subscriptions,” Lynne Biggar, the executive vice president for consumer marketing and revenue at Time Inc., said in a statement. “We hope to expand our partnership with Coinbase in the coming months to create more opportunities to provide greater value to our customers.” Consumers can purchase subscriptions for Fortune, Health, This Old House and Travel and Leisure. Other Time Inc. publications, including People, Sports Illustrated and Food and Wine, have been excluded for now. Many companies that have begun allowing users to transact with Bitcoin have been rooted in technology, including Overstock, Dell and Expedia. Time Inc.’s decision is a sign that even once-traditional businesses are now seeing opportunity in Bitcoin. Digital currency, for instance, would give consumers a faster way to pay for subscriptions. Bitcoin transactions also cost merchants less than credit card payments in processing fees.  “For a major publisher like Time Inc. to embrace Bitcoin sends an important message to both its readers and to the broader media community,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive and co-founder of Coinbase, said in a statement.  In a separate blog post, Coinbase said Time Inc.’s decision to accept Bitcoin would help the publishing industry “understand and explore new business models that can be enabled with Bitcoin,” including micropayments. The idea is that consumers could one day pay for individual articles or videos with Bitcoin. Time Inc., which says it reaches 130 million consumers each month, has been criticized for holding on too strongly to its past, and accepting Bitcoin may be part of the company’s attempt to be seen as hipper and younger. Although Bitcoin will probably not solve the magazine industry’s wider problems, including declining subscriptions and sliding revenue, Time Inc.’s decision is obviously already generating publicity.",0.20666315789473685,0.13003626490468595

But Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, isn’t quite ready to give in to digital money. “The reality is, we compete with any form of payments” Mr. Chenault said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in Manhattan.”Everyone focuses on the displacement of Bitcoin and the credit card industry.” But, he added, “there’s a reason credit cards were invented.” In particular, he said, people want the ability to defer payments.  The Bitcoin industry has taken aim at the relatively high transaction fees that credit card companies charge merchants. Virtual currency supporters argue that Bitcoin would allow these businesses to save money, which they could then pass on to their customers. On the other hand, opponents argue that credit cards, unlike Bitcoin, offer more protection against fraud. Though some of Mr. Chenault’s peers have been far more skeptical of Bitcoin, his argument is another indication that the traditional banking industry has yet to fully embrace digital currency.  In an interview on CNBC in January, for instance, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, called Bitcoin “a terrible store of value” that could be “replicated over and over.”  Still, Mr. Chenault said he saw promise in Bitcoin’s underlying technology. “The protocol of Bitcoin is going to be important,” he said. Alternative currencies, he added, are like the music service Napster, and later iTunes, with their potential to drive industry change.  “I don’t know how this is going to evolve,” Mr. Chenault said about new forms of money and the payments system. “I think there’s room for a lot of players.”",0.15518235294117644,0.025717468805704104

Paul Camp, who led JPMorgan’s global transaction services business before leaving the bank in July, is joining Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that processes digital transactions. Mr. Camp will serve as the company’s chief financial officer and corporate treasurer. “We’ve been interested in trying to find an additional partner on the team with highly relevant leadership capacity,” said Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s founder and chief executive. “Paul had grown up in that core payments infrastructure. That was really a key piece of what we were looking for.” At JPMorgan, Mr. Camp oversaw the division responsible for holding and moving money for big companies and organizations. Previously, he had served in a similar role at Deutsche Bank, where he helped establish the bank as a leader in euro settlements and payments.   Big banks like JPMorgan have long dominated the business of global transactions. Now, a number of start-ups, including Circle — which allows customers to buy, sell, store and transfer Bitcoin — are looking to upend the established system of transferring money. “Our view is that consumer finance, what people think of as retail finance — that arena is ripe for disruption,” Mr. Allaire said. “Bitcoin is absolutely a core platform and asset format that we are dependent on to build this business.” Circle, based in Boston, has secured $26 million in venture financing, including from the venture firm Accel Partners. Although Mr. Camp’s move is unlikely to signal a diaspora of bank executives to digital currency start-ups, his decision to join Circle is another indication that leaders in the traditional financial services industry are now taking digital money seriously.  Mr. Camp also appears to have broken away from JPMorgan’s stance on virtual currency. Unlike some financial institutions, which have approached Bitcoin with caution, JPMorgan has come out against virtual currency. In an interview with CNBC in January, Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, expressed particular disdain, calling Bitcoin “a terrible store of value” that could be “replicated over and over.” “The question isn’t whether we accept it,” Mr. Dimon said. “The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?” It is this negative perception that Mr. Allaire is hoping to sway, and, he said, he is looking to Mr. Camp to play a big role.  “We need to build banking relationship all around the world to offer our products,” Mr. Allaire said. “His background and skill set will be really helpful.”",0.05251111111111111,-0.027057613168724282
162,The Trouble With Cryptocurrency’s Viral Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/opinion/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-viral-growth.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-09-25T19:15:56+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have lost over half their value so far in 2018, and more than that since late 2017. These virtual currencies have crashed before, but this time they seem in no hurry to gain back lost ground, largely because recent evidence has revealed problems with the new technology.  In one recent study, a team of academic researchers said that market manipulation might have been behind Bitcoin’s steep increase in value in 2017. And a recent report by the New York attorney general’s office found substantial risk that consumers who invested in cryptocurrency could lose access to it, either temporarily or permanently, if there were problems at their exchange. The report also uncovered that many of the exchanges had traded on their own markets, essentially creating a conflict of interest in which they were trading against their own customers. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were started not as a way to get rich but to provide an electronic payment system that was more secure and resistant to fraud than credit cards and eliminated the need for trusted intermediaries like financial institutions. Because cryptocurrencies were not controlled by a central institution like a government or even a governing nonprofit, they were supposed to give the holder the reliability of gold, without the inconvenience of having to transfer a physical item to make a transaction.  Large organizations and technically savvy users may have valid reasons for using cryptocurrencies, especially for transactions between governments or large multinational corporations. However, for the ordinary citizen, cryptocurrency is in fact less secure, more vulnerable to sudden drops in value and — surprisingly — more dependent on trust in an intermediary institution than fiat currency like the United States dollar.  In the world of cryptocurrency, there are two categories of intermediary institutions. The first category contains the exchanges where users buy, sell and store their virtual currency. These exchanges include Coinbase, which the New York attorney general’s report claimed traded on its own platform, and the now-bankrupt Mt. Gox exchange, which lost over 700,000 of its users’ Bitcoins to hackers in 2014. The second category is made up of the people and companies who create and sell their own cryptocurrency, using initial coin offerings. This year, two founders of a virtual currency called Centra were arrested and charged with “conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.” In May, The Wall Street Journal found that hundreds of initial coin offerings were “using deceptive or even fraudulent tactics to lure investors.” More recently, social networks such as Facebook promised to connect everyone in the world and give users a platform to speak freely. As we’ve seen, they did not make things free; they opened us up to manipulation by anyone, anywhere. There is a feeling I get when I log in to Facebook and am assaulted by clickbait news, overly intrusive ads and a confusing inability to configure my feed to show me the updates from friends that I came here to Facebook to read. “Free” is not the word for it. Facebook has become less free than an ordinary real-life conversation, not despite the ability to connect to to anyone but because of it. We saw something similar in peer-to-peer lending, where people could take the savings of one person who needed to invest and transfer it to another person who needed to borrow. The system was supposed to make the economy work more fairly, by removing the arbitrary and inefficient banker middlemen. Instead of following through on its promise, peer-to-peer lending in China has resulted in a lot of lost money for ordinary citizen savers, creating an unstable financial sector.  In software engineering, we have a phrase for this: “That’s not a bug, it’s a feature.” Established systems (such as customs, regulations or software) are the way they are, for many reasons, some of them now forgotten. Sometimes we never know all the reasons a system needed restrictions or limitations until we discover a way to make new systems without them and discover (for better or for worse) what happens without those constraints. Cryptocurrency, peer-to-peer lending, and anonymity and pseudonymity in communication are all impressive feats of engineering. They are also all excellent at showing us the value of a society that requires a stable identity, government support of a currency and oversight of its financial systems.  Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction was in 2010; by late 2017 it had grown to a value of over $100 billion. Facebook grew to one billion users in about the same amount of time. The word “viral” is often used to describe such exponential growth, but viruses grow exponentially for a reason, and it has nothing to do with a benefit to the host. If a new technology grows exponentially, that ought to make us wary, not excited.  We need time to discover and address the problems in any new system. We also need time to revisit the restrictions and limitations of established systems, and see if they still apply. The underlying danger is that some of these new systems and technologies have grown too fast and have been adopted for general use before we recognize the problems caused by their lack of restrictions.  Many of the so-called limitations of government-regulated currencies are features, not bugs. There is a place for cryptocurrency, though I don’t believe it’s for the average, nontechnical user. In general, cryptocurrencies are not a replacement for ordinary currencies. That’s not in spite of their freedom from government control but precisely because of it.",0.06721315789473685,0.13657500759474445

But an upstart exchange made a big bet last week that the virtual currency still held promise as an investment. The exchange, SecondMarket, which is based in New York, nearly swept the government’s latest Bitcoin auction, winning 48,000 of the 50,000 Bitcoins for sale. The exchange’s syndicate, which received 104 bids from eight parties, won 19 of the auction’s 20 Bitcoin blocks. “Obviously, we’re very thrilled with the results,” said Brendan O’Connor, the managing director of trading at SecondMarket. SecondMarket was started in 2004 by Barry E. Silbert, who runs the Bitcoin Investment Trust investment fund. The venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, who won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in the United States Marshals Service’s first auction in June, said last Friday that he had won only 2,000 Bitcoins in last week’s auction. Mr. Draper bid on behalf of his venture firm, Draper Associates. The Marshals Service confirmed on Tuesday that SecondMarket had won 48,000 Bitcoins and that the transfer of the coins was completed on Monday. The auction last Thursday of 50,000 Bitcoins, worth about $19 million, was the second by the Marshals Service for Bitcoins seized in connection with Silk Road, the defunct online bazaar. In June, it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, which was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was an online marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. A number of other prominent Bitcoin players, including Pantera Capital and Mirror, previously called Vaurum, also participated in last week’s auction. Still, the latest sale raised questions about whether the appetite for Bitcoin among investors was subsiding. The Marshals Service said last week that only 11 bidders participated in Thursday’s auction, a sharp decrease from the first auction, when 45 bidders took part. The service received 27 unique bids this time, compared with 63 in June. And at the time of the second auction, Bitcoin was trading at about $370, down from its peak of about $1,150 a year ago and about $200 below its price at the start of the first auction in June, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. It was trading just below $350 on Tuesday morning. “The demand is starting to dry up,” said David L. Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “I think a lot of the excitement may have bled out of investors.” Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations, which analysts had said were driven partly by speculative trading, have all but disappeared in recent months. This price stability, in turn, might have further discouraged opportunistic, short-term investors from participating in the auction, Mr. Yermack said. Others in the Bitcoin industry, however, dismissed the notion that the virtual currency was no longer an attractive investment. Instead, they said, the fact that fewer bidders participated in the second auction was a sign that the Bitcoin market was becoming more liquid. “Volumes have picked up, so there are other ways to get larger trades relatively easily,” said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics who studies alternative currencies. “The Bitcoin market has matured.” The government’s two auctions represent only a small portion of the total amount of Bitcoins seized in connection with Silk Road. The government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins, including 144,336 found on computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who is said to have created Silk Road. Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, said by email at the time the second auction was announced that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins “in the coming months,” but that “no exact dates have been determined.” The promise of at least one more auction, however, has some in the Bitcoin industry worried. “Bitcoin is in a bit of a holding pattern, or a bit of a lull, and people may think that there’s more downward pressure on the price,” said Mr. Hileman, the economic historian. “Now, we’re onto the harsh reality of who wants to buy into another auction.”",0.07928857142857143,0.12317039442039443

After all, a single bidder had won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in the government’s first auction in June, leaving the rest of the participants discouraged. But the Bitcoin king of June ended up just a bit player today. On Friday, the venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, the first auction’s sole victor, said he had won just one block of 2,000 Bitcoins, a fraction of the 50,000 the Marshals Service had put up for sale. Mr. Draper bid on behalf of his venture firm, Draper Associates. “I will have to buy some more Bitcoin on the open market to fulfill my commitment to the new batch of Boost companies,” Mr. Draper said in an email. Draper Associates had teamed up with Boost VC, the Bitcoin start-up accelerator founded by his son, Adam Draper, to invest 300 Bitcoins in every company that works with Boost. The Marshals Service said it would notify all winning bidders by 5 p.m. “We are unable to confirm, deny or make any further announcements until the entire award process has concluded, including the completion of required financial transactions,” Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, said in an emailed statement on Friday. Winners must initiate wire transfers to pay for their Bitcoins by 2 p.m. on Monday. Thursday’s auction of 50,000 Bitcoins, worth around $19 million, was the second held by the Marshals Service for Bitcoins seized in connection with the defunct online marketplace Silk Road. In June, it sold nearly 30,000 of the Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, which was shut down in October 2013 after authorities said it was an online marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. Because of the slump in Bitcoin’s price since the June auction, when it was trading around $600, the total value for sale in both auctions was about equal. The Marshals Service said on Thursday that only 11 registered bidders took part in its second auction, far fewer than the 45 bidders who participated in the first auction. It received 27 bids this time, compared with 63 bids in June. Some of the same bidders who participated in the first auction also submitted bids on Thursday. Along with Mr. Draper, SecondMarket and Pantera Capital both allowed investors to bid through syndicates. SecondMarket said its syndicate received 104 bids from eight bidders, significantly fewer than the 186 bids from 42 bidders in the first auction. Likewise, Dan Morehead, the founder of Pantera Capital, said fewer investors participated in his syndicate this time, though he declined to give any figures. Mirror, previously called Vaurum, also participated in the second auction with a syndicate. SecondMarket and Pantera declined to comment on Friday evening. There are still nearly 94,000 Bitcoins to be auctioned by the government.  A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, Lynzey Donahue, said in an email at the time the second auction was announced that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins “in the coming months,” but that “no exact dates have been determined.” Since the Marshals Service announced the second auction in November, Bitcoin’s price has held steady at around $375, according to CoinDesk. The auction appeared to have little effect on the price on Friday. In the days after the first auction in June, the price of Bitcoin climbed to about $655 from around $570.  ",0.11336129032258063,0.038691058045896766

The Silk Road site was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was a marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. In the auction five months ago, the Marshals Service sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins.  The agency declined to comment further on Thursday.  Some of the same investors who participated in the first auction again submitted bids this time. SecondMarket and Pantera Bitcoin both allowed customers to bid through syndicates. The venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, who was the first auction’s sole winner, said he planned to participate in Thursday’s auction. But some bidders in the first auction chose to sit out the latest one. The Bitcoin Shop did not participate, nor did Rangeley Capital. Alex Waters, chief executive and co-founder of Coin Apex, who appeared to send his bid live on Bloomberg Television during the first auction, was also absent this time. Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor that participated in the first auction, declined to comment. The results of the Marshals Service’s first auction may have dissuaded bidders from participating in Thursday’s auction, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “The big difference is that people already saw how last time went.”  Though the Marshals Service did not announce the price of Mr. Draper’s winning bid, it is widely assumed among Bitcoin investors that he bid above Bitcoin’s market price at the time. As a result, some investors who had hoped to get a bargain last time saw little point in participating in this auction. Bitcoin is now trading at around $370, down from about $570 at the start of the June auction.  “Unless you can get a steep discount to market, it’s a lot of risk,” said Charles Allen, the chief executive of the Bitcoin Shop. “If we’re not going to get a discount, what’s the point?” Winklevoss Capital, a start-up venture firm started by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their legal battles with the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, did not participate in either auction. “We don’t generally participate in auctions where there is limited information, a high likelihood of a winner’s curse and a low likelihood of achieving an efficient price. That being said, anything can happen and we wish the participants the best of luck,” Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement on Thursday. The latest auction is for Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of creating Silk Road.

Gox Bitcoin Exchange,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/mt-gox-bankruptcy-trustee-to-tap-kraken-exchange-in-repaying-creditors/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-11-26T04:30:30+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Customers of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, are closer to getting back at least some of the money they lost this year when it shut down and announced that their funds had gone missing. The bankruptcy trustee for Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo, announced on Wednesday that it would work with a California-based Bitcoin exchange, Kraken, to return the money left in the estate to the company’s 127,000 creditors. Jesse Powell, Kraken’s chief executive, said during a news conference in Tokyo on Wednesday that his company would help with the claims process, including evaluating the assets owed to creditors, and that it would assist in the investigation of Mt. Gox’s collapse. He said the trustee would have the final decision on payments in Bitcoin. “Allowing the creditors to go on without reinvestment, I think, would be very wrong,” he said, adding, “We’ve got to have the money that was locked up for the last 10 months returned as soon as possible.” On the question of whether Mt. Gox would be revived, Mr. Powell said: “There are no assets, no brand. There is nothing to speak of to revive.” The decision is a somewhat unexpected development in the saga of Mt. Gox’s collapse, which rocked the upstart world of Bitcoin. When Mt. Gox initially went down in February, the company’s chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said the company had either lost or been robbed of 850,000 coins, worth about $500 million at the time. Mr. Karpeles said that 100,000 of the missing coins belonged to the exchange but that the rest were owned by customers. A few weeks after Mt. Gox shut down, Mr. Karpeles announced he had found about 200,000 coins that he had thought were missing, leaving 650,000 still unaccounted for. Mr. Karpeles has said that hackers appeared to have stolen the money. Yet while several law enforcement authorities in Japan and the United States have reportedly been investigating, they have produced few answers. As part of its mandate from the bankruptcy trustee, Kraken will participate in the investigation. The price of a Bitcoin has dropped by half since Mt. Gox closed but has recently stabilized at just under $400. The 200,000 coins discovered after the exchange shut down appear to represent the bulk of the estate’s assets, though the trustee has not recently commented on his success in recovering missing assets. In a July filing, the company said that in addition to 202,100 coins, it had 779 million yen, or about $6.6 million, in other assets. The court-appointed trustee previously suggested that the remaining coins could be converted into dollars before being returned. But many creditors resisted, worried that the conversion of all that Bitcoin into dollars would depress the digital currency’s value. Several companies in the virtual-currency industry vied to take over either the business or assets of Mt. Gox, or both, an attractive proposition given the size of its customer base. A group called Sunlot Holdings, led by John Betts, a former Wall Street executive, said in March that it had signed an agreement with Mr. Karpeles to revive the exchange. But that deal quickly fell apart. The choice of Kraken is notable because it is not one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges. The company has catered primarily to European customers, through a partnership with a German bank, and recently opened in Japan. But Kraken has developed a reputation for taking a careful approach that has kept it in good standing with regulators. The job of reimbursing Mt. Gox creditors should be a boon for Kraken because they will most likely be required to open an account with Kraken to get their money back. That should lead to a significant increase in the number of people with Kraken accounts, and some of them could continue using the exchange.

The auction, scheduled for Dec. 4, comes about five months after the Marshals Service’s first Bitcoin auction, when it sold nearly 30,000 of the Bitcoins seized from Silk Road, which was shut down in October 2013 after authorities said it was online marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit activities. The latest auction is for Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of creating Silk Road. Prosecutors and Mr.Ulbricht agreed in January that the government could sell the virtual currency it had seized.  Bidders in the government’s second Bitcoin auction will have a six-hour window on Dec. 4 to submit a sealed bid for the coins, which have been broken into several lots. The first series contains 10 blocks of 2,000 Bitcoins, while the second series contains 10 blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins. Bidders can participate in both series and can bid on multiple blocks. Registration for interested parties to participate in the auction began on Monday at 9 a.m. and will end at noon on Dec. 1. The Marshals Service will notify eligible bidders on Dec. 2, with the winner, or winners, notified on Dec. 5. As was the case before the first auction, bidders must prove their identities and that they have a required amount in cash. They also have to certify that they are not affiliated with Silk Road or Mr. Ulbricht. The government’s two auctions represent only a small fraction of the total amount of Bitcoin seized in connection with Silk Road.  Including 144,336 Bitcoin found on computer hardware belonging to Mr. Ulbricht, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins. A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, Lynzey Donahue, said in an email that the agency anticipated selling the remaining Bitcoins “in the coming months,” but that “no exact dates have been determined.” The Marshals Service’s first Bitcoin auction, held at the end of June, was not without a few hiccups. The agency, which had said it would not release any information about the bidders or winning bids, accidentally released a list of potential bidders before the auction. The mistake made some recipients of the message uneasy and spurred questions about the agency’s ability to handle the virtual currency. Potential bidders also criticized the agency for what it said was a process that sometimes lacked transparency.  For the most part, experts excused the slip-ups, saying the agency was figuring out how to auction Bitcoin, which was so unlike the hard assets, like cars and jewelry, typically auctions by the federal government. Before the first auction, investors and analysts were also wary that auctioning such a large amount of Bitcoin, which represented a substantial percentage of the average daily trading volume, would push the price of the virtual currency down.  That anxiety proved unfounded, though the price of Bitcoin has since declined. It is now trading at about $380, according to CoinDesk, down from about $570 when the first auction began.  The Marshals Service’s first auction was generally regarded as a success, attracting the attention of a number of prominent technology names, including Barry Silbert of SecondMarket, Pantera Bitcoin and Coinbase. The venture capitalist Tim Draper was the auction’s sole winner, taking home Bitcoin worth about $19 million at the time. Many in the Bitcoin world pointed to the widespread interest in the auction as a sign that the virtual currency was moving further into the mainstream, beyond the realm of anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology geeks. The government’s second auction comes as Bitcoin appears to be at a pivotal point in its development. Venture capital money has poured into Bitcoin-related start-ups recently, even as some in the industry say the virtual currency is losing a bit of its luster. For one, potential competition from the likes of Apple Pay and other mobile payment options have caused a bit of consternation. Others say they are still waiting for Bitcoin to reach its full potential as a system for transferring value across the world, rather than simply a virtual currency. The case against Mr. Ulbricht, which was scheduled to begin this month, has been postponed until January.",0.07271578947368422,0.05979159207542666

Mr. Matonis will remain on the foundation’s board until Dec. 31. Mr. Matonis, who was named executive director in July 2013, will be succeeded by Patrick Murck, the foundation’s general counsel. “Leading the Bitcoin Foundation has been a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Mr. Matonis said in a statement. “Merging the diverse interests of the Bitcoin community has been intellectually and professionally stimulating.” “I look forward to advancing Bitcoin and contributing to the community through the private sector,” he added.  Mr. Matonis also took to Twitter to express his gratitude: The time has come for me to resign as Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Thank you for all of your passionate support! More soon. — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) 30 Oct 14 During his tenure, Mr. Matonis spoke passionately about Bitcoin’s future, saying recently that it would one day replace gold.  The Bitcoin Foundation said the decision to resign was Mr. Matonis’s. Established in 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation has become one of the most prominent voices in the virtual currency industry. Its leaders have spoken at a number of government hearings, including the first Senate hearing on digital currency last November. More recently, the foundation has been vocal on the New York Department of Financial Services’ proposed virtual currency regulations. In a letter soon after the rules were introduced, the foundation pressed the department to extend the public comment period and provide more precise language on the risks unique to digital currencies. Mr. Matonis’s decision comes as Bitcoin is at a critical point. In the last year, Bitcoin has become more popular in the mainstream, but many supporters say it has yet to reach its full potential. The Bitcoin industry is also waiting to see how regulators will treat the virtual currency and whether new rules will lead to its more widespread adoption. The foundation itself has had its own share of growing pains. Charles Shrem, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and one of the foundation’s founding board members, stepped down from his position shortly after he was arrested in January and accused of helping smooth the way for drug transaction on the now-defunct online marketplace Silk Road. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty in September to one count of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, resigned from the board before the exchange’s collapse in February. And in May, a number of Bitcoin members cancelled their memberships, citing, among other issues, the foundation’s leadership. “Two years is a lifetime in Bitcoin, and we’ve come a long way from where we began. And yet, there is still so much ahead of us,” Mr. Murck said in a statement. “I commit to continue paving the way for our community of investors, entrepreneurs and technologists to maximize Bitcoin’s potential for all people.” The foundation said it was working on naming a new general counsel to succeed Mr. Murck.",0.07797222222222223,0.06991243453049008

Chairman to Advise Two Prominent Bitcoin Companies,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/former-s-e-c-chairmain-to-advise-two-prominent-bitcoin-companies/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-10-28T21:02:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Since it was introduced more than five years ago, Bitcoin has been viewed as a way to operate outside the realm of the existing financial system and the laws that govern it. But more recently, Bitcoin companies have been luring the financial establishment into their ranks. In what virtual currency supporters say is a sign that the Bitcoin industry is maturing, several well-known financial and legal experts have joined Bitcoin companies. The latest, and arguably most prominent, is Arthur Levitt Jr., the longest-serving chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who will serve as an adviser to BitPay, the Bitcoin payment processor, and Vaurum, an exchange for institutional investors. The moves were announced on Tuesday. “The brainpower behind Bitcoin technology and cryptocurrency is so deep and so challenging that I was attracted to it,” Mr. Levitt said in an interview. “The fact that so few people in America understand what Bitcoin is made me interested in the possibility of helping define it.” Mr. Levitt, who is 83, ran the S.E.C. from 1993 to 2001. He is on the board of Motif Investing, an online investing platform, and Bloomberg L.P. and has also served as an adviser to Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Carlyle Group. Mr. Levitt said he aims to help both BitPay and Vaurum build their businesses and encourage them to be transparent with regulators.  “I personally believe that a company that deals with regulation has kind of a good housekeeper seal of approval,” Mr. Levitt said. “Even though some in the industry believe that this space shouldn’t be regulated, I think a mature industry that really is an international factor must have the transparency that regulation can bring to it.” Mr. Levitt’s decision to advise BitPay and Vaurum comes as Bitcoin is at something of a crossroads in its development. As the virtual currency has become more popular, government officials and regulators have started taking steps to bring it under their purview. Among others, the Internal Revenue Service, the S.E.C. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have all acknowledged Bitcoin’s growing presence in the mainstream. A number of highly publicized failures, like the collapse of Mt. Gox in February, have made the need for more stringent oversight especially apparent. Still, formal regulations have been somewhat slow to take hold. The New York Department of Financial Services, for instance, proposed rules for virtual currency companies in July. The initial comment period on the regulations ended last week after the department bowed to pressure from the Bitcoin industry to extend the time allowed for the public to submit their views on the rules. In the meantime, Bitcoin companies have begun to bring on government insiders and well-known legal experts to help them navigate the uncertainty. Coinbase, for example, recently hired John Collins, a former adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, as its head of government affairs. Mr. Collins, who focused on digital currency, will work with lawmakers and public officials on policy decisions related to virtual money. In September, Blockchain retained Marco Santori, a business lawyer in New York, as global policy counsel.  Part of the reason Bitcoin companies are adding these types of experts in-house is because they want to work closely with government officials to write rules that will allow for Bitcoin’s continued success. Because digital currency is relatively unfamiliar, the Bitcoin industry is wary that regulations could go too far and stanch future innovation. Others recognize that regulations, if written with appropriate guidance, would discourage shady Bitcoin businesses, which could make everyday consumers more willing to use the virtual currency. “Well-formulated regulation can help because you don’t want everyone to start a Bitcoin business,” said Jim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and an original member of the Department of Homeland Security’s data privacy and integrity advisory committee, who joined the Bitcoin Foundation as global policy counsel earlier this year.  “We want the Bitcoin ecosystem to be one that’s safe to use.” ",0.18436944444444445,0.09425084175084177

The company, one of the most popular digital wallet providers, has hired John Collins, a former adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, as its head of government affairs. Mr. Collins, who focused on digital currency, will work with lawmakers and public officials on policy decisions related to virtual money. “Bitcoin is an extremely powerful technology,” said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase. “As the leader in the space, our main goal is to educate people who are going to form the regulations around it in its formative years so its potential remains.” Coinbase’s moves comes as Bitcoin start-ups have been uncertain of what potential regulations will be coming. In July, for example, New York became the first state to issue proposed rules for digital currency companies. The public comment period on the BitLicense regulations is set to end next week. Bitcoin has also attracted the attention of other prominent regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Many Bitcoin companies have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward regulations. Some, like the start-up Coinapult, based in Panama City, have chosen to avoid operating in the United States until regulations become clearer. Others, like Circle, have been vocal about the effect ill-informed regulations could have on the industry. But as changes are proposed, Coinbase has tried to persuade regulators of its views on new Bitcoin policies. Its leaders have met with various government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, to help inform the discussions about digital currency, Mr. Ehrsam said.  Coinbase’s desire to insert itself into the regulatory conversation is motivated, in part, by self-interest. As a wallet provider and payment processor, the company’s core businesses are in some ways dependent on how government agencies decide to treat the currency. But the company insists it is trying to preserve the core values of Bitcoin and ensure that it continues to be an open platform that anyone can use. Mr. Collins previously worked for Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which held the first congressional hearing on digital currencies last November. At Coinbase, which is based in San Francisco, Mr. Collins said he wanted to “build a larger coalition of folks” who understood Bitcoin’s potential, including government officials. Most important, he said, will be to educate regulators about Bitcoin so they adopt rules that protect customers without hampering innovation.  “Coinbase’s whole mission is to really make Bitcoin easy to understand and easy to use,” Mr. Collins said. “We really do believe that this technology has a lot of promise in this sector and other sectors.”",0.2777,0.0830200149644594

Even though concerns remain about the digital currency’s staying power, Bitcoin start-ups are attracting more dollars from well-known venture capitalists. In the latest move, Blockchain, a Bitcoin wallet provider and software developer, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has closed a roughly $30.5 million fund-raising round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Wicklow Capital. The investment, raised from Blockchain’s first round of outside financing, is one of the biggest in the digital currency industry to date. Since it was founded in 2011, Blockchain, which is based in Britain, has gained respect in the industry for adhering to the virtual currency’s original philosophy of anonymity and decentralization. Roger Ver, a libertarian known in some circles as the Bitcoin Jesus, was the first backer and supporter of the company. The price of one Bitcoin, which reached a peak of about $1,150 last year, fell over the weekend to its lowest point of the year after tumbling 20 percent, to about $286, according to CoinDesk, a virtual currency website. Bitcoin was trading on Monday evening at about $330. But despite the failure of some Bitcoin-related sites and new regulatory challenges, more than $250 million has been invested in Bitcoin companies, most of that in the last 12 months, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. “Over the course of the next 10 years, Bitcoin is going to have a big impact,” said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed who will join Blockchain’s board. “Where is the central nexus of value creation in this whole industry? It has to be the wallet,” he said. Blockchain’s financing round follows a spate of big investments in Bitcoin companies, particularly those that offer storage services. Coinbase, for example, secured $25 million last year in a financing round led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Another Bitcoin company, Xapo, said in July that it had raised $40 million from investors including Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Bitcoin has been slow to gain more widespread use in the mainstream. In developed countries, virtual money is still largely the plaything of technology enthusiasts and speculators, though some retailers and stores have trumpeted their acceptance of Bitcoin. In emerging markets, where some see enormous potential for Bitcoin, the infrastructure to process transactions simply does not exist. For Bitcoin to become more widely adopted, supporters say, the virtual currency must find a unique application that will take it beyond the realm of speculation. And for that to happen, companies must first build a robust platform, which is what Blockchain says it is trying to do. Blockchain has criticized other companies that essentially allow customers to bet on Bitcoin’s price, a practice that it sees as straying from the currency’s core mission. Blockchain says it tries to make it easier for people across the globe to use Bitcoin. The company has 2.3 million consumer wallets, making it among the most popular wallet services in the world. It has also developed a search engine that allows users to verify transactions quickly in the currency’s public ledger, known as the Bitcoin blockchain. Most of the company’s revenue comes from advertising. Peter Smith, the president of Blockchain, said the company planned to use its new financing to expand and to invest in developing markets. The company says it is working on software to make it easier to transfer Bitcoin. “Right now, we’re going into a period where it’s not just enough to have Bitcoin be tantalizing,” Mr. Smith said. “We need Bitcoin to actually be useful.” It is this emphasis on improving the Bitcoin platform that seems to have attracted Blockchain’s latest investors, a group that also included Mosaic Ventures and Richard Branson. In particular, investors said that they had been impressed with Blockchain’s ability to establish itself as a key player in the industry without outside capital. “Blockchain is far and away an early leader in Bitcoin,” said Rafael Corrales, a partner at the venture capital firm CRV who personally invested in Blockchain’s funding round. “They’re actually enabling the entire ecosystem.”",0.25455,0.11437161796536797

Some contend that Bitcoin’s price is irrelevant and that it does not reflect the virtual currency’s true value. Bitcoin is still most popular among speculators and technology enthusiasts and has yet to find a general use that will push it into the mainstream and help stabilize its price, they say. Bitcoin’s recent price decline can appear jarring, but it is nothing new. Indeed, some say the wild price swings have hindered the virtual currency’s widespread adoption. Since it was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer, or group of programmers, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated unpredictably. After reaching its peak of about $1,150 late last year, the price has been in a prolonged slide. In August, a flash crash briefly set the currency world on edge, as the price dipped on one exchange to just over $300 from nearly $500. Bitcoin ended that day down about 12 percent. “For anyone complaining about the current price of Bitcoin, remember it has more than doubled over the last 12 months,” Roger Ver, a Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, said in a Twitter message on Sunday. But even those most confident in Bitcoin are having trouble explaining the recent decline. One reason for the drop could be uncertainty over potential regulations. In July, New York became the first state to propose regulations for Bitcoin companies. The comment period for the regulations, which were introduced by the Department of Financial Services, is set to end on Oct. 21. Bitcoin has attracted the attention of a number of other regulatory agencies in the United States, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. The increase in the number of merchants now accepting Bitcoin could also be affecting the price. These merchants, including Overstock and Dell, use third-party payment processors like Coinbase to immediately convert Bitcoin to dollars. This means there are more Bitcoins in circulation, which could be helping to drive down the price. Some say simply that the market has been distracted with other events, including the Alibaba Group’s initial public offering and the recent surge in the United States dollar. Against this backdrop, there have been questions about whether Bitcoin can become more than a commodity. For that to happen, however, developers must find a way to harness its underlying technology to enable tasks that were previously difficult, expensive or impossible. These include cross-border transfers like remittances, which under the current financial system can be subject to high fees and long delays. Once Bitcoin finds a general use, the price is likely to stabilize, they say. “Right now, Bitcoin is in this transition stage where it’s a commodity trying to become a currency,” said Rafael Corrales, a partner at the venture capital firm Charles River Ventures who has followed Bitcoin. “When Bitcoin becomes a currency, it realizes its potential.”",0.09001785714285715,0.02210047756476328

But now the hot hum comes from thousands of Chinese computer servers whirring away 24 hours a day for a very modern purpose: producing Bitcoins and other digital currencies. The crackerbox-size machines stacked inside rusty cargo containers are powered by the same cheap source of electricity once used to extract aluminum from ore. They represent the first stage of an obscure company’s plan to convert the 60-year-old smelting works into the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mine. “The size is overwhelming,” said Prieur Leary, as he led a tour of the 1,300-acre site formerly known as Alcoa East. “Maybe we’re a little bit crazy.” Mr. Leary is the chief technology officer of Coinmint, which has led an influx of entrepreneurs to this economically depressed region, all seeking to capitalize on the soaring value of digital currencies, like Bitcoin. Their arrival has been met with wariness — just what are they doing? — coupled with fears of their outsize thirst for electricity. A backlash has spurred changes in state regulations and local building codes and some officials worry about becoming the East Coast counterpart to Wenatchee, Wash., which has been inundated by cryptocurrency speculators. But neither local resistance nor a steep decline in the value of Bitcoin has blunted the demand for practically any space with a reliable power supply. Utility officials in this remote corner of New York — known as the North Country — continue to receive weekly inquiries from people aspiring to set up cryptocurrency mines. [What Is Bitcoin, and How Does It Work?] The region is an unlikely front in the global race to produce Bitcoin. Massena used to be a hub for making things — tangible things, like V-8 engines and parts for the Apollo 11 spacecraft. The factories that churned out those products are, for the most part, gone. Thousands of union jobs that paid well and offered full benefits have vanished, leaving the area with one of the state’s highest unemployment rates. But the iconic American corporations that abandoned plants in Massena left behind the precious resource that drew them here in the first place: abundant, cheap electricity flowing from a dam in the St. Lawrence River. Some locals had never heard of cryptocurrency before their utility bills increased last winter and they learned that start up ventures rushing to cash in on the Bitcoin boom were responsible. If they knew anything about this new type of intangible money, it was that Bitcoin’s value had shot up last year to nearly $20,000 from $1,000. (It has since fallen back to about $6,300.) Bitcoin is nearly a decade old, but that dizzying run-up and fall has put the North Country on the crypto-mining map. Before the speculators arrived in Massena, they discovered Plattsburgh, a small city about 80 miles to the east that was also awash in cheap hydropower from the St. Lawrence. Mr. Leary showed up there two years ago, before Bitcoin had fully registered in the popular consciousness, and set up shop in an industrial park. Coinmint filled a small space with servers built for the singular task of creating cryptocurrency, running them nonstop. Each server, or miner, draws as much as 1.5 kilowatts, or about twice as much as a typical refrigerator. As the Bitcoin market grew, Mr. Leary expanded into much bigger space in a nearby shopping center that had been a distribution center for comic books. Soon, Coinmint installed four transformers that could draw more than 13 megawatts, or enough power to run about 10,000 homes. It was more than one-tenth of the local utility’s total allocation of low-cost hydropower. This heavy usage was not a problem on most days, said Colin Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh. But during an extreme cold spell last winter, the people of Plattsburgh got a costly glimpse at the impact their new neighbors could have. With electricity so cheap that most residents use it to heat their homes, the city’s consumption exceeded its allocation on several days, Mr. Read explained. As a result, the Municipal Lighting Department had to purchase additional power at much higher prices — a cost it spread across its customers. “We had a huge rash of complaints” about the jump in utility bills, Mr. Read said. Among those complaining was Thomas Recny, the chief financial officer of one of city’s biggest employers, Mold-Rite Plastics. Mr. Recny said his company’s electric bills were about $60,000 higher than normal for January and February, an unforeseen increase of about 30 percent. Mr. Recny asked why an enterprise that required only a few people to run it should be able to drive up the operating costs of a company that employed about 500. “The only reason they’re here is this unusually inexpensive rate for power,” Mr. Recny said. “But with two guys, they can consume more electricity than a hospital.” Mr. Recny also said he was “still somewhat puzzled” about the need for digital currency, which he knew could be used for essentially anonymous online transactions. He questioned whether it was appropriate “to have the electricity used for that purpose,” which he said might involve some illicit activities. Sitting in his office in City Hall near the shore of Lake Champlain, Mr. Read had a more positive view of cryptocurrency. He said he told his economics students at SUNY Plattsburgh that it would exist in some form, whatever the fate of Bitcoin itself, for many years. “No doubt about that,” he said. The mining operations that ultimately survive will be those that get the most electricity at the lowest prices, he said. Whether they deserve it is a separate question that Plattsburgh, Massena and other towns in the region have been grappling with. Their municipal utilities have persuaded state regulators to allow them to charge higher rates for electricity to cryptocurrency miners. In March, Plattsburgh became the first American municipality to impose a moratorium on new cryptocurrency mining while the city decides how to cope with the new burdens on its power grid. In the meantime, Mr. Read said, city officials are adapting building codes to account for the fire hazards posed by the servers, each of which can generate as much heat as a small space heater. The concerns are part of a broader battle over the enormous carbon footprint  of Bitcoin mining, which on a global scale uses as much energy as a medium-sized country. Mr. Read estimated that Coinmint had made a profit of more than $50 million in Plattsburgh. Leon Christman, who manages the company’s operations there, said the larger installation in Plattsburgh — the one with the leftover image of Spiderman painted on the back wall — earned $600,000 on its best day last year. Plattsburgh’s temporary ban sent Mr. Leary to Massena, in St. Lawrence County, looking for an expansion site. Massena’s municipal utility, owned by its ratepayers, was already trying to hold Bitcoin speculators at bay as it figured out how to accommodate their demands, said Andrew J. McMahon, superintendent of the Massena Electric Department. “Back last fall when Bitcoin was at $15,000 to $20,000, we were getting eight to 10 calls a week and they were wanting to set up within two or three weeks,” Mr. McMahon recounted. “These guys were wanting to plug in 10, 20, 30 megawatts. They were asking: How much do you have?” The answer was nowhere near that much. Massena’s system has never distributed more than 50 megawatts at a time, and the biggest users draw just a few megawatts. In its industrial heyday, Massena was home to two aluminum plants and a General Motors factory. But they were far too big to connect to the municipal system. They tapped directly into the state’s power grid and purchased the lowest-priced wholesale power. Mr. Leary wanted to follow that recipe. Earlier this year, the New York Power Authority agreed to provide 15 megawatts of subsidized power to Coinmint. But the authority grew skeptical of the company’s promises for job creation and local investment, scuttling that agreement and leaving Coinmint to obtain its power on the wholesale market, Mr. Leary said. Standing outside the old Alcoa plant, Mr. Leary pointed out new bundles of black cables leading from an electric substation to smaller transformers inside. Those cables could deliver more than 40 megawatts now, he said, with the potential to increase the capacity tenfold. “We’re just getting started,” Mr. Leary said. Coinmint told state officials it would eventually employ 150 people in Massena, but only a few clusters of workers were visible on a recent midday tour of the plant. Still, some residents welcomed the cryptocurrency miners — even if they weren’t too sure exactly what it is they do. Over lunch at Spanky’s, a diner on Massena’s Main Street, Brad and Nancy Fletcher said they had no idea that Coinmint was already operating at Alcoa East. Mr. Fletcher, a retired state trooper, helps his wife manage her family’s RV park in neighboring Franklin County, which Mrs. Fletcher said was “even more depressed than St. Lawrence County.” Besides the remaining aluminum works, the biggest employers in the area are prisons and a casino on the St. Regis Mohawk tribal land, the Fletchers said. If Coinmint fulfilled its promise, “that’s 150 more people that are going to be working,” Mrs. Fletcher said. “The area needs jobs. Anything that’s going to bring some would be good.”",0.035314432989690725,0.10705943455170258

Bitcoins are managed through a global, peer-verified network rather than a central entity like the Federal Reserve. Beyond shots of Mr. Mross grilling burgers and joking about sending his baby to college on bitcoins, this largely optimistic documentary — directed by his brother, Nicholas Mross — explores the wider world of bitcoin entrepreneurship. The idea of a currency without a government appeals to libertarians. Bitcoins might help to integrate less developed countries into the global economy. The movie also acknowledges a dark side. There’s an interview with a drug-dealing early adopter identified only as Mr. Bitcoin. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, expresses concern with the potential for money laundering and terrorist financing.

Apple’s digital wallet, if widely adopted, could usher in a new era of ease and convenience. But the really exciting part is the fast-emerging future that it points toward, in which virtual assets of all sorts — traditional currencies, but also Bitcoin, airline miles, cellphone minutes — are interchangeable, opening up enormous purchasing power for consumers and creating tough challenges for governments around the world. Moving toward a digital wallet for dollars (or yen, or euros) is only a marginal step forward; throughout history, money’s value has been largely virtual anyway — think of stocks, or personal lines of credit. The real change is how the digital wallet technology facilitates the parallel emergence of virtual purchasing power, like loyalty points.  We don’t typically think of these as currency, because virtual money has traditionally been locked down, in the sense that its use was strictly limited: If you earned points from Amazon, only you could use them, and you could exchange them for dollars only within the Amazon marketplace. Meanwhile, up to now, the only currencies you could use everywhere in an economy were state-issued currencies, like the dollar.  But that distinction is eroding: After all, the value of a currency lies in what you can buy with it, not in the fact that a government says it’s worth something. So if I want to buy a widget, and the only thing I can use to buy it is Widgetcash, then I am willing to trade dollars or euros or anything else for Widgetcash. When I buy something with Widgetcash, it doesn’t go through any bank. That’s why a digital wallet, loaded with your dollars, credit and loyalty points, is such a revolutionary technology — it makes those transfers and transactions seamless and safe.  Imagine you want to buy a shirt at Target. Your digital wallet can pay for it with dollars, your Target points or any other form of purchasing power that Target accepts. Wave your phone at the cash register, and the shirt is yours.  That’s the sort of thing that the current generation of digital wallets already promises; the only obstacle is adoption by retailers. But that won’t be an obstacle for long. Frictionless exchange is a killer app. Some companies might lose value in their loyalty programs, but others will find enormous value in issuing their own currencies for advertising or data-tracking purposes, or even just because the creation of a successful virtual currency or digital wallet lets companies make money by making money. That’s certainly Apple’s bet. The revolution is what comes next: an exchange that connects and trades these different stores of value to find the most cost-efficient one to use, both within your wallet and between wallet users, worldwide. Let’s say you want to buy an audiobook from Best Buy. It costs $16, or 1,000 My Best Buy points, or M.B.B.P.s. Your wallet contains several hundred dollars and 200 Best Buy points. The wallet software automatically determines that, at the current exchange rate between M.B.B.P.s and dollars, it is better to buy using the points.  But then let’s say you only have 50 M.B.B.P.s. The wallet system searches its clients and finds someone — call her Hannah — with enough M.B.B.P.s for the transaction. It buys the audiobook with her points and sends it to you, and sends Hannah dollars from your account.  Following Bitcoin’s protocol, the wallet software broadcasts these transactions to the network, and every wallet in the world updates the M.B.B.P.-to-dollar exchange rate.  The idea is that you can buy anything, with anything. The wallet will find the best deal and execute it. In so doing, it will ignore the historical and cultural differences between dollars, points, coins and virtual property. It’s all bits anyway.  This sort of digital wallet raises difficult problems for regulators, who rely on institutional intermediaries like banks as the point for monitoring transactions. But a digital wallet can be a phone app; just like the cash in your pocket, it doesn’t require accounts with any intermediary. A wallet app can be written by anyone, downloaded by anyone and secured and maintained by everyone. In this huge river of money, there is no narrow channel from which the state can divert flow into its own fields.  Consider the tax implications. If you get caught cheating on your taxes and flee the country, the government could compel your bank to freeze your assets and cough up the money. But what if there’s no bank?  One concern that doesn’t apply is transparency. Digital wallets don’t hide trades or encourage criminal transactions. Using Bitcoin is much less secret than using hard cash. The government, and anybody else, can easily see the trades passing through our wallets, just as every trade in Bitcoin is visible at blockchain.info. Even if you try to hide who you are, network or traffic analysis can often de-anonymize you. The critical point is that, with a digital wallet, a government or bank can see the trades, but it will be harder to compel or block them. As exchange becomes less costly to perform, it becomes more costly to regulate. That means different things depending on your politics. You might celebrate the freedom the technology could bring to the 2.5 billion people in the world without adequate access to financial services, or you might worry about abuse by criminals. One thing that will not work is pretending that these technologies — and their revolutionary implications — don’t exist.",0.12655625,0.112213303671637

The company, one of the most popular digital wallet providers, said on Wednesday that it was expanding to 13 European countries, including France, Italy and the Netherlands, by allowing those with authorized European bank accounts to buy and sell Bitcoins in exchange for euros. Previously, only users with United States bank accounts could exchange Bitcoins on Coinbase, though anyone in the world could set up a digital wallet to hold the virtual currency. “The ability to easily buy and sell Bitcoin has been a really key factor in accelerating Bitcoin adoption,” said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase. “This opens up the entire network to a larger degree.” In the beginning, Coinbase, based in San Francisco, will limit Bitcoin purchases and sales to 500 euros, or about $645, a day to ensure the process is smooth, but Mr. Ehrsam said he expected that limit to increase quickly. Coinbase allows United States users to buy and sell up to $50,000 a day in Bitcoin. Coinbase’s move comes as Bitcoin is at a pivotal point in its development. Bitcoin has undeniably become more popular since it was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto, with a number of well-known merchants, including Overstock and Dell, now accepting the virtual currency. Just this week, Braintree, the payments processing company owned by eBay, said that its customers would soon be able to accept Bitcoin. Regulators around the world have taken note of Bitcoin as well, stirring anxiety in some circles that government oversight will squash the freedom and anonymity that attracts many virtual currency users. But even as Bitcoin enters the mainstream lexicon, supporters say Bitcoin’s potential — which lies in its underlying technology — has yet to be fully exploited. For the virtual currency to become truly useful, they say, Bitcoin must harness this peer-to-peer technology to make it easier to complete tasks that were previously difficult, expensive or impossible. These include cross-border transfers like remittances, which, under the current financial system, can be subject to high fees and long delays. By taking out the middleman, Bitcoin could offer a simpler, cheaper way for people to send money across the globe. One of the first steps, however, is getting Bitcoin into the hands of more people, and companies like Coinbase — along with other exchanges that accept multiple currencies — are playing a big role in expanding the virtual currency’s network. Coinbase, which has raised $31 million from prominent investors, expects to grow even more rapidly with the new expansion. The company has 1.6 million customer accounts, largely in the United States, up from 20,000 at the beginning of 2013, Mr. Ehrsam said. He added that he was optimistic that European activity would equal that in the United States in about a year. Eventually, Coinbase is planning to extend its offerings to countries beyond Europe. As Bitcoin becomes more accessible, Mr. Ehrsam said he hoped more merchants across the globe would begin to accept the virtual currency as a payment option. Coinbase, which has teamed up with many of the big-name merchants in the United States to process Bitcoin payments, is also working on creating online payment pages for merchants in their local languages. “Bitcoin is inherently international, and one of its great promises is it enable cross-border payments in a more efficient way,” Mr. Ehrsam said. “It now allows these cross-border payments to flow, and the entire network benefits from the fact that we happen to be the ones to launch it.”",0.3811111111111111,0.17818173801507134

Braintree, the payments processing company owned by eBay, said Monday that its customers would soon be able to accept Bitcoin, the digital currency popular in some tech and finance circles.  The company, which eBay bought for $800 million in cash one year ago, is considered a more developer-friendly division of PayPal, eBay’s online payments behemoth. Many of Braintree’s clients are tech start-ups like Uber, Airbnb and TaskRabbit, businesses that are looking for easy ways to integrate payments into their products for a low cost.  “It feels like we’re at the right moment in time now that a lot of those early problems with Bitcoin have been solved,” Bill Ready, chief executive of Braintree, said on stage Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt technology conference in San Francisco.  Many companies have been slow to adopt the fledgling digital currency, which has stunted potential growth; because so few companies accept it, consumers are less likely to adopt and regularly use Bitcoin.   Bitcoin has some upside for merchants willing to accept it, including lower transaction fees than credit cards. Because of this, some major consumer Internet companies are starting to toe the waters. Overstock.com, an online retailer, began accepting Bitcoin payments this year. Expedia, the online travel booking site, also accepts the alternative currency, as does the computing giant Dell Inc. The move is not surprising for Braintree, whose clients include many tech companies whose customers are more likely to be early adopters of the new currency.  Mr. Ready did not specify which Braintree clients would eventually accept Bitcoin, but said that customers should expect to hear more in the coming months. ",0.24948571428571428,0.17008284374355803

Mr. Shrem was arrested in January and was accused of using his company to convert dollars into Bitcoin for users of Silk Road, the now-defunct online marketplace known for selling narcotics and drug paraphernalia. Federal prosecutors contend that he operated the scheme in cooperation with Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing. Mr. Faiella also pleaded guilty on Thursday to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The pleas were part of a deal with prosecutors from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Reading from a statement, Mr. Shrem said he had knowingly helped Mr. Faiella from January 2012 to October 2012 by exchanging dollars into Bitcoin using his company, BitInstant. He said Mr. Faiella would in turn sell Bitcoin to people who wanted to buy drugs on Silk Road. “I knew that what I was doing was wrong,” Mr. Shrem, 24, said in the statement. “I am pleading guilty because I am guilty.”
 Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella both face up to five years in prison. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court set Jan. 20 as the sentencing date for both men. Before Thursday’s hearing in New York federal court in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Shrem, in jeans and a dark suit jacket, sat alone on a bench outside courtroom 14B, his right leg crossed over his left as he read a book. He appeared calm, fidgeting only slightly once he entered the courtroom. Known for his charisma, he was instead stoic, his voice unwavering, when he entered his plea. A founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation’s board and a co-founder and former chief executive of the company BitInstant, Mr. Shrem has been one of the most vocal advocates of Bitcoin. After his arrest at Kennedy International Airport in January, some in the Bitcoin world have distanced themselves from Mr. Shrem.  And while Mr. Shrem’s charisma has given him a powerful voice among Bitcoin enthusiasts, a few have expressed concern that he has a tendency to say too much. Though he had been under house arrest at his parents’ house in Brooklyn, he has continued to speak publicly in support of Bitcoin. He has also been working for Payza, an online platform for sending and receiving the coins. Mr. Shrem’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said after the court appearance that Mr. Shrem had every intention of staying involved with Bitcoin. “Charlie Shrem is on a path to making Bitcoin a more accepted and useful currency,” he said. “If God smiles on him, hopefully he will be back in the Bitcoin world.”",-0.005418918918918913,-0.02257468507468507

He is to plead in New York  to one count of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem, one of the most vocal advocates of Bitcoin, was accused in January of using his company to convert dollars into Bitcoin for users of Silk Road, the now-defunct bazaar known for its wide selection of narcotics and drug paraphernalia. Federal prosecutors contended that he operated the scheme in cooperation with Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing, who was also arrested in January, in Florida. “They want a guilty plea on their books, and that’s what they’re going to get,” Mr. Shrem said on Saturday from his parents’ home in Brooklyn. “They got a Bitcoiner.” Mr. Shrem’s arrest at Kennedy International Airport this year stirred consternation in the Bitcoin world, which continues to grapple with the perception that the digital currency provides an anonymous way to engage in illegal activity. Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella were both charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem was also charged with “willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report” regarding Mr. Faiella’s actions. At the time of Mr. Shrem’s arrest, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that the authorities would “aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.” The United States attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. When it was introduced in 2009, Bitcoin appealed largely to anti-establishment enthusiasts who wanted to circumvent the traditional financial system. As it has gained popularity, government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, have wrestled with how to regulate the virtual currency. In July, New York’s Department of Financial Services proposed the first state rules for virtual currency companies. A so-called BitLicense would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secured, stored or maintained custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its first consumer advisory on virtual currencies this month. But even as regulators seek to impose rules for virtual currency, the Bitcoin industry remains a powerful force, particularly in online black markets. A second version of Silk Road has formed, which sells many of the same drugs that the first marketplace offered. Since his arrest, Mr. Shrem — a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation’s board and a co-founder and former chief executive of the company BitInstant — has remained involved with Bitcoin. In addition to speaking engagements, he said he had been working for Payza, an online platform for sending and receiving the coins, and had set up an office at a co-working space in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Shrem had been under house arrest at his parents’, but he has been allowed to leave the home from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on most weekdays. Mr. Shrem, 24, said his plea could include jail time, though he is optimistic that it will not. Before his sentencing in about three months, he said, he plans to ask Bitcoin supporters to write letters to the judge on his behalf. Mr. Shrem’s plans to plead were first reported by Reuters. Once his current legal troubles are behind him, he said, he intended to travel to various places around the United States and possibly to Europe. Mr. Shrem said he would continue to press for Bitcoin and intended to be involved in regulatory efforts. “I want to do the good work I was doing before I got arrested,” he said.",0.022027499999999995,0.04245238095238095

He was 58. Mr. Finney had been paralyzed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., and was taken off life support at Paradise Valley Hospital, his wife, Fran Finney, said. She said his body was immediately prepared for cryonic preservation by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz., according to his wishes. A graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Mr. Finney was a longtime futurist who put his programming skills to work in the service of his ideals, particularly his desire to see the privacy of individuals protected. In 1991, he began doing volunteer work for a new software project known as Pretty Good Privacy, or P.G.P., and immediately became one of the central players in developing the program. P.G.P. aimed to make it possible for people everywhere to encrypt electronic communication in a way that could not be read by anyone other than the intended recipient. The program used relatively new innovations in encryption that are still thought to be invulnerable to code breakers.  Mr. Finney wrote in 1992 that cryptographic technology appealed to him because he worried about the ability of corporations and governments to snoop on citizens.  “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,” he wrote to an online group of fellow privacy activists. The original author of P.G.P., Philip R. Zimmermann, quickly became the target of federal prosecutors, who believed that the software broke United States laws against exporting military-grade encryption software. While the investigation went on and became a major cause for civil libertarians, Mr. Finney played a more quiet role in P.G.P. to avoid becoming a target himself. Mr. Zimmermann said in an interview that this decision meant Mr. Finney did not get proper credit for some of the important innovations he had made in the development of P.G.P. When the investigation concluded in 1996 without any charges being filed, P.G.P. became a company, and Mr. Zimmermann set out to hire Mr. Finney as his first employee. Mr. Zimmermann, in an interview before Mr. Finney died, said Mr. Finney was unusual in the field because he had none of the asocial tendencies and physical awkwardness that are commonly associated with people in the programming world. Rather, he said, Mr. Finney was a gregarious man who loved skiing and long-distance running. “Sometimes people pay some price for being extremely smart — they are deficient in some emotional quality,” Mr. Zimmermann said. “Hal was not like that.” While working on P.G.P., Mr. Finney was a regular participant in a number of futurist mailing lists, the most famous of which gave birth to the Cypherpunk movement, dedicated to privacy-enhancing cryptography. Following these lists, Mr. Finney became fascinated by the concept of digital currencies that could not be tracked by governments and banks.  He was involved in many experiments aimed at creating an anonymous form of digital money, including his own invention, in 2004, of reusable proofs of work. Though that system never took off, he quickly saw the promise of the Bitcoin project when it was announced on an obscure email list in 2008 by a creator with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  Bitcoin used some of the same cryptographic tools harnessed by P.G.P. and held out the promise that participants could choose to be anonymous when spending money online.  When the project drew criticism from other cryptographers, Mr. Finney was among the first people to defend it. He downloaded the Bitcoin software the day it was released. The day after that, he took part in the first transaction on the network when Satoshi Nakamoto sent him 10 Bitcoins.  His early work on Bitcoin and his programming background led to frequent speculation in the Bitcoin community that Mr. Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim he always denied. Soon after getting started with Bitcoin, Mr. Finney learned in 2009 that he had A.L.S., and he withdrew, for a time, from active participation in the project.  Harold Thomas Finney II was born on May 4, 1956, in Coalinga, Calif., to Virginia and Harold Thomas Finney. His father was a petroleum engineer.  After graduating from Caltech in 1979 with a degree in engineering, he worked for a company that developed video games like Astroblast and Space Attack.  As a young man, Mr. Finney developed an interest in preserving life through cryonic freezing until better, life-enhancing technologies were invented, said a college roommate, Yin Shih. In 1992, Mr. Finney visited the Alcor facility with his wife to determine whether he wanted to sign up his family to be preserved in Alcor’s “containment vessels.” “In my personal opinion, anyone born today has a better than 50-50 chance of living effectively forever,” he wrote at the time. Mr. Finney remained an employee of the P.G.P. Corporation until his retirement in 2011, working from his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. In the last few years, Mr. Finney was able to move only his facial muscles, but he communicated and wrote Bitcoin-related software using a computer that tracked his eye movement. “I’m pretty lucky over all,” Mr. Finney wrote on a Bitcoin website in 2013. “Even with the A.L.S., my life is very satisfying.” As the price of Bitcoins rose, his family, to pay for his medical care, was able to sell some of the coins he secured in the early days. Besides his wife, Mr. Finney is survived by a son, Jason; a daughter, Erin Finney; two sisters, Kathleen Finney and Patricia Wolf; and a brother, Michael. His wife, a physical therapist whom he met at Caltech, spent most of her days caring for him in his final years. After Mr. Finney’s death, the freezing of his remains was announced by another futurist, Max More. “Hal,” he wrote in a statement online. “I know I speak for many when I say that I look forward to speaking to you again sometime in the future and to throwing a party in honor of your revival.”",0.12021527777777778,0.0956800895863396
181,Election Panel Enacts Policies by Not Acting,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/us/politics/election-panel-enacts-policies-by-not-acting.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-08-26T01:51:09+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"WASHINGTON — The three Republican and three Democratic appointees of the Federal Election Commission had reached yet another deadlock: They would issue no advisory opinion on whether the Conservative Action Fund could accept contributions of Bitcoin, the online currency created to be untraceable. But a ruling of sorts emerged nonetheless in the hearing, held late last year, when one of the Republican commissioners, Lee E. Goodman, suggested that the group could essentially do as it pleased. The fund “has a clear statutory right to give and receive in-kind contributions regardless of what we say here today,” Mr. Goodman said. The case was just one of the more than 200 times in the past six years that the commission has split votes, reflecting a deep ideological divide over how aggressively to regulate money in politics that mirrors the partisan gridlock in Congress. But instead of paralyzing the commission, the 3-to-3 votes have created a rapidly expanding universe of unofficial law, where Republican commissioners have loosened restrictions on candidates and outside groups simply by signaling what standards they are willing to enforce. Campaign lawyers of both parties say the deadlocks have profoundly, if informally, affected the rules governing campaigns, particularly on questions involving whether political nonprofit groups must disclose their finances and the threshold for starting an investigation.  The splits are consistent enough in spelling out the likely direction of enforcement, they say, that they now advise clients that a 3-to-3 split comes close to official commission policy. “If you’ve got a client who is not as risk-averse, then you can sit down with them and say, ‘Here’s the situation, you have three commissioners who say this is lawful, and that is something you can rely on between now and November for your campaign strategy,’ ” said Michael E. Toner, a Republican election lawyer and former commissioner. Some election lawyers have even turned the deadlocks into a kind of marketing spiel. As Anthony Herman, a lawyer at Covington & Burling, put it in an article on the firm’s website: “The F.E.C.: Where a ‘Tie’ Can Be (Almost) a ‘Win.’ ” In an interview, Mr. Goodman, the commission chairman, described the guiding principle as one of deference to First Amendment political speech. In case of a deadlock, he said, the “tie goes to the speaker.” That philosophy has not only changed the way older regulations are applied, but has also helped create de facto rules on emerging issues: whether candidates can set up fake websites for opponents to raise money for themselves, for example, and what disclosures are required on text-message political ads. Perhaps the biggest impact is on the rapidly growing world of outside spending. F.E.C. deadlocks have transformed the regulatory system intended to ensure that outside groups operate independently of the candidates they support — the distinction that, under the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, permits them to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Twice the commission has reached an impasse on rules affecting whether a “super PAC” can borrow video prepared by a candidate for his or her own ads. Candidates of both parties now routinely make available so-called B-roll video, ensuring that super PAC ads look and feel similar to the candidate’s own ads. In a January hearing on text-message advertising, Caroline C. Hunter, one of the Republican commissioners, told the lawyer for a left-leaning digital media firm that his client need not worry if the commission declined to bless its proposed approach to disclosure. “It looks like this is going to go down 3 to 3,” Ms. Hunter said. “And so there’s not four votes to say, ‘You can’t do this.’ ” Under federal law, no more than three members of the commission may belong to the same political party. Four votes are required to issue an advisory opinion, pursue an investigation or agree on a punishment. Veterans of the commission say that for many years the arrangement was effective in encouraging commissioners to apply rules consistently to both parties. But deadlocks have become far more common since 2008, when three new Republican commissioners joined the commission. According to a study by Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal-leaning group Public Citizen, the commission has not only taken up far fewer advisory requests and issued fewer regulations than it did before 2008, it has also split votes on a greater proportion of the matters it does consider. In the five years leading up to 2008, the commission held 3,634 votes on enforcement actions and split votes on 39. In the five subsequent years, it held just 866 enforcement votes, and split votes on 123 of them. “The Republicans on the commission realized they can render the commission toothless,” said Mr. Holman, whose organization favors tougher disclosure rules and is suing the commission for what it says is a failure to enforce existing disclosure rules against Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, a leading Republican outside group. Mr. Goodman acknowledged that candidates and outside groups were operating in a less restrictive regulatory environment than five years ago. But he argued that the shift reflected deregulatory court rulings, such as Citizens United, and a proper restraint in applying limits on political speech. “Certainly the Republicans have become far more circumspect in where we draw the lines,” Mr. Goodman said. Mr. Goodman also said that the percentage of deadlocks had dropped over the past year and represented only a small percentage of total votes by the commission. “Our opinion is as legitimate as their opinion,” he said, referring to the three commissioners appointed by Democrats. “If there aren’t four votes to support a regulatory position, it’s not the position of the F.E.C.” The deadlocks appear to have had a particular impact on enforcement cases. In a series of deadlocks over proposed fines or settlements, Republican commissioners have in effect created a new, higher standard for investigations, arguing that direct evidence of a violation must already exist before the commission staff can even begin investigating a complaint. “It is not enough for the commission to believe that there is a reason to investigate whether a violation occurred,” the three Republican commissioners wrote in an opinion last year blocking an investigation into officials of the Arizona Democratic Party. A commission deadlock on a complaint can be challenged in court, but under court rulings dating to the early 1990s, federal judges in such cases have deferred to the legal interpretation of the three commissioners voting to block an investigation. “The fact that there is this deference given to what is an obstacle to disclosure ultimately means that there is no meaningful judicial remedy when the F.E.C. does not come to a decision,” said Ann M. Ravel, a Democrat who joined the commission last year. Even apparent agreements among the commissioners can be illusory. In May, in a separate request involving Bitcoin, the commissioners unanimously agreed that a fledgling group called Make Your Laws could accept small Bitcoin contributions of no more than $100.  But in a separate statement, Mr. Goodman suggested that potential Bitcoins donors should not worry about the new policy. The advisory opinion, he wrote, “in no way establishes the outer boundary for the contribution and use of Bitcoins.”",0.06679622641509435,0.0498364371477579

A cashless society is still a long way off, but automated machines that turn traditional money into virtual currency are cropping up across the globe. The trend has come to New York — Flat 128, a retailer that sells British jewelry and accessories in the West Village, is home to the first such machine in Manhattan and is becoming a destination for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Yet this new Bitcoin A.T.M. is only a means for users to deposit cash and convert it to Bitcoins for their accounts; it does not offer cash withdrawals. Still, virtual currency supporters see the growth of these machines as a milestone that will help Bitcoin A.T.M.s become as widespread as traditional bank A.T.M.s. For that to happen, however, customers will have to get used to exchanging real money for digital code, which may be a bit unsettling for those accustomed to cash, or even credit cards. As Bitcoin gains acceptance, such A.T.M.s are providing a fast path to change cash to Bitcoin. They also are a way to access Bitcoin for those who do not want to deal with online exchanges or who lack a traditional bank account. “The goal of Bitcoin is to make money digital,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “This is really a temporary way of bridging between physical currency and digital currency.” The A.T.M.s appeal in particular to those who want to maintain the anonymity associated with Bitcoin, he said. The companies that make the Bitcoin A.T.M.s say they aim to make virtual currency as easy to obtain as buying food from a vending machine or ordering a car ride from Uber on a smartphone. Even so, some in the virtual currency industry acknowledge that the machines are a marketing gimmick. “Having these machines in stores, especially quality stores that sell quality items, is really going to raise the profile of Bitcoin,” said Matt Russell, the chief marketing officer for PYC, a company that operates Bitcoin A.T.M.s in New York. “We’d be fools to not think that marketing is a part of this.” If the A.T.M.s are to help push Bitcoin further into the mainstream, then more consumers may be seeing machines, like the one that went live at Flat 128 last week, which is operated by PYC. The machine may be a draw for Bitcoin enthusiasts, many of whom probably never would have set foot in the store otherwise. “I heard about it from friends,” Adam Krellenstein, a developer at a Bitcoin company, said on Friday, standing awkwardly among the chunky necklaces and expensive rings. Flat 128’s regular clientele seemed confused by the new attention. Some peered cautiously at the machine, asking what it did and how it worked. One, after noticing a photographer nearby, asked if she had walked into some sort of special event. Elizabeth DuBois, the owner of Flat 128, said the A.T.M. had increased traffic, estimating that 15 to 20 people had visited her boutique each day to use the A.T.M. Merchants around the country say that the Bitcoin A.T.M.s are helping draw would-be customers, too. Some of those are in coffee shops, where the tech crowd and early Bitcoin adopters are coming in for beverages. Small shops like Flat 128 certainly benefit from the publicity that comes with accepting Bitcoin, but there are also significant financial advantages, including lower processing fees. There are about 200 working Bitcoin A.T.M.s around the world, according to the website Coin ATM Radar, which keeps track of the machines in operation. As that number grows, one company expecting a surge in business is Lamassu, which manufactured the machine in Manhattan. The company, based in New Hampshire, started selling Bitcoin A.T.M.s last August and has since shipped 250 machines to 45 countries, although many are not yet set up to convert local currency into Bitcoins, said Zach Harvey, who runs Lamassu with his brother. About 80 of the machines, which cost about $6,500 each, are in operation worldwide, he said. The machine’s operator is responsible for loading the machine with Bitcoins, similar to the way a bank ensures that its A.T.M.s have enough to cover cash withdrawals. The operator also determines the transaction fee. For example, PYC has set the fee at its Manhattan A.T.M. at about 5 percent of the transaction value. At Flat 128, the only things users need to exchange cash for Bitcoins with a Lamassu machine are an existing Bitcoin wallet and a smartphone. After hitting a start button on the machine’s touch screen, users access their Bitcoin wallet’s QR code, a type of bar code, from their phone. They then scan the code against a small screen on the machine and insert cash. To initiate the currency exchange, they select “Send Bitcoins.” It takes only a few seconds for Bitcoins to appear, via the Internet, in the user’s digital wallet. Other manufacturers of Bitcoin A.T.M.s, including Genesis Coin and the Canadian company BitAccess, aim to also allow users to turn Bitcoins into cash. Even as the rise of these A.T.M.s suggests that Bitcoin is gaining ground, the virtual currency world is also facing the prospect of new rules that could stunt growth. Government agencies continue to make efforts to regulate digital money, stirring concern that virtual currency could eventually be regulated into oblivion. In July, for example, New York State proposed rules for virtual currency companies that some in the Bitcoin world believe could make it too expensive to operate in the state. Bitcoin A.T.M.s are particularly vulnerable to regulations intended to prevent money laundering. “I’m always concerned about harsher regulation,” said Mr. Harvey of Lamassu. “If the barrier for entry is too high, then these machines might have to move out of New York City.” Despite these looming rules, Bitcoin supporters are largely optimistic that it is not only a viable form of currency, but also increasingly accessible. Mr. Russell of PYC was on hand Friday to answer questions about Manhattan’s first A.T.M. About three months ago, he purchased the A.T.M. for $5,000 in Bitcoin and kept it in his East Village apartment. He and Ms. DuBois, Flat 128’s owner, decided to bring the machine to her store in part to introduce the idea of Bitcoin to consumers who might not be familiar with the virtual currency. “It makes them understand that it’s not a foreign thing,” Mr. Russell said. “It’s just like getting cash from a bank, but Bitcoin.”",0.12078909090909092,0.03762894529712711

Those interested in submitting comments on the new rules will now have until Oct. 21. The move comes after a number of prominent Bitcoin supporters requested additional time to comment on the draft rules, which is intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York and includes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A “BitLicense” would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of their customers. “It’s obvious that this is a novel regulation,” Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, said in an interview on Thursday. “It’s really the collision of banking regulations with new technology, and we want to make sure we get it right.” Should Mr. Lawsky’s office make significant changes to the proposal after the comment period, they will go out for further review. Since the proposed regulations were introduced in July, Bitcoin supporters have had a mixed reaction on whether the rules will help legitimize digital money or stanch innovation and threaten the freedom Bitcoin was intended to foster. Many in the Bitcoin industry expressed concern that the original 45 days allotted for comments would not allow for enough time to fully digest the proposals. Start-ups in particular said they simply did not have enough resources to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial institutions. Mr. Lawsky said his office had received thousands of comments on the issue. Soon after the draft rules were made public, a group of about 400 virtual currency supporters sent a letter to Mr. Lawsky asking for a 45-day extension of the comment period. The Bitcoin Foundation sent a similar letter in the first week of August requesting up to six more months to provide feedback. Supporters have also asked that the comment process be more iterative and that Mr. Lawsky hold a public hearing to discuss the proposals. On Wednesday, the three biggest Bitcoin exchanges in China, BTC China, OKCoin, and Huobi, sent comments to Mr. Lawsky addressing the proposed rules. Among other issues, the exchanges said that the BitLicense framework should only cover virtual currency companies with “meaningful” connections to New York. “As written, the proposed regulation is overly broad in its application outside the United States, imposes a disproportionate compliance burden on virtual currency businesses and misapplies normal compliance procedures,” they said in a release.",0.18477826086956523,0.12266257293431206

Nathaniel Popper, who covers cryptocurrencies and financial technology for The Times from San Francisco, discussed the tech he’s using. There are many cryptocurrencies and they often fluctuate in value. What tech products do you use to keep your finger on the pulse? Most conversations about cryptocurrencies tend to start with the price, and there are now countless services that track the ups and downs of the thousands of digital tokens out there. The most popular site, Coinmarketcap.com, was briefly getting more visits than The Wall Street Journal’s home page last winter. My personal favorite is Onchainfx.com, which makes it easy to compare lots of interesting stats, like how many people are using a coin, and how intensely programmers are working on the underlying software. Beyond the price, though, cryptocurrencies are so fascinating because of the communities that develop around them. People tend to congregate on Reddit, Twitter and Telegram, so I have to check in there to see what people are talking about. This is also where you tend to see the first hints that projects are scammy or fraudulent. For communicating with sources, I have to use way too many messaging apps. In China, where cryptocurrencies are big, everyone is on WeChat. Most other sources outside the United States are on either WhatsApp or Telegram. In the United States, the anti-government folks — and the privacy advocates who are concerned about surveillance — only want to chat on Signal, which encrypts messages in both directions. You also cover financial tech. How has technology changed the way people do banking and what do you think of all the fintech start-ups? There have been several advances in online financial services that seem like real progress to me and I’m always surprised that more people don’t take advantage of them. At the most basic level, the advent of online check deposits has made it so that I don’t need to go into a bank, which I’ll be happy to never do again. Online banking has also made it easier to shop for better interest rates and benefits. Guided by sites like Bankrate and Nerdwallet, I’ve moved my money around quite a bit as I look for the best deals. I currently have an account with Ally, which is giving me 1.8 percent on my cash — compared with the 0.1 percent that Wells Fargo is offering — and reimburses me for any fees I get charged when I use out-of-network ATMs. I do the same shopping for credit cards, often following the advice of The Points Guy to find the best perks and free miles. For people with good credit, there’s little reason not to be getting back 2 percent on everything you purchase, and for people with worse credit, it is now much easier to find lower interest rates. Beyond these banking services, though, I’ve been somewhat underwhelmed by the products being offered by the enormous crop of fintech start-ups that have popped up over the last decade. I’ve tried lots of apps and tools to get my financial life in order, but few of them are sufficiently intuitive, or add much beyond what you can get from traditional providers like Vanguard and Mint — or a simple Excel spreadsheet. When I was house hunting last year, I did use Credit Karma to stay on top of my credit score. But beyond that, financial arrangements are incredibly personal, which seems to make it difficult to automate. It’s also harder for people to experiment with financial apps than with other online services because it often requires entering lots of banking details that people don’t want to share. At this point, the only financial apps I regularly use beyond my bank are Venmo and Square Cash, which have made it so much easier to send money to friends and family. You’re not allowed to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for ethical reasons. But if you could, would you?  When people ask me whether they should buy cryptocurrencies, my answer is almost always no. All of these digital tokens have a much higher chance of going to zero than most investments that are available to small-time investors. I do make an exception for people who are genuinely interested in the novel qualities of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, like the ability to hold money on a shared ledger, rather than in a bank, and to send money without going through intermediaries. But even for these folks, the place to start is by buying a very small quantity — say $50 of Bitcoin or Ether — to try it out and see what it can do. If, at that point, you still think this is going to take over the world, then buy more — but only what you are willing to lose. Cryptocurrencies have tanked recently. Will the likes of Bitcoin, Ether and XRP ever be worth nothing? That is a distinct possibility. Even one of Bitcoin’s biggest cheerleaders, Wences Casares, has said there is still a 20 percent chance that it goes to zero. For most other coins, which have weathered many fewer attacks and unexpected hurdles, the chances are undoubtedly higher. There are still basic questions about whether the technology underlying virtual currencies can scale to take on more users and preserve the privacy of those users. There are also economic questions about how the prices will behave, and how users will respond to the changing prices if and when more people start using the coins. At this point, these are all still experiments in what happens when you put together a bunch of cutting-edge cryptography, legal theory and economics. But that is also what makes it so interesting. What tech products do you obsess over in your personal life?  My love of music has me constantly searching for better streaming radio stations without ads or talk. I am also always trying to make better playlists on Spotify in the hopes that it will help Spotify better find new music for me. I am fascinated with why Spotify doesn’t give me better suggestions and generally just offers up the most boring version of what I’ve already listened to. In both my personal and work life I’m a big user of services like Instapaper and Evernote that help keep all my reading and notes in sync across various devices. I do my best thinking when I am moving, so I wrote much of my book and the drafts of many articles in the Evernote app on my phone. Around the house, we use an Amazon Echo and a Google Home device to set timers and play music for my kids. But I also love testing all the ways that these “smart” devices are still terrible at answering the most basic questions and completing the most basic tasks. One of my favorites was when I asked Alexa to play a symphony by Beethoven and she said: “I couldn’t find any symphony songs by Beethoven.”",0.3594833333333334,0.18774664158592733

Chain, which aims to make it easier for developers to build Bitcoin applications, announced on Wednesday that it had closed a $9.5 million investment round led by Khosla Ventures, bringing its total funding to $13.7 million. RRE Ventures, Thrive Capital, SV Angel, Pantera Capital and the Bitcoin investor Barry Silbert were also among the backers. Keith Rabois, an investment partner at Khosla and a former chief operating officer of Square, has joined the company’s board. “Bitcoin is this tremendous financial innovation that’s changing the world, and we’re really excited to play a central role in that,” said Adam Ludwin, who co-founded Chain. “The promise that Bitcoin offers to basically hit the reset button on the financial system is real.” It is this potential that continues to lure venture capital companies to the virtual currency. The Bitcoin company BitPay scooped up $30 million in May. And in December, Coinbase, a third-party payment processor, raised $25 million led by the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz.  Like other digital money supporters, these investors generally believe that Bitcoin could eventually be used to transfer money around the world without using traditional payment channels. “I think they now recognize the huge commercial potential of the technology,” Mr. Ludwin said, referring to venture investors. “Every single top-tier firm is taking Bitcoin incredibly seriously.” When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin appealed largely to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs, but it has since become increasingly popular in the mainstream. A number of well-known merchants, including Overstock, Expedia and Dell, now accept the virtual currency. Bitcoin has also caught the eye of regulators, including New York State’s Department of Financial Services, which recently proposed legislation for virtual currency companies. Chain, which was formed six months ago, provides quick access to Bitcoin’s online ledger of transactions, called the blockchain, allowing developers to integrate the currency’s technology more easily into their products.   Since the company went live in May, it has signed up more than a thousand developers building products like Bitcoin wallets and exchanges. It has also been in talks with several big financial institutions that want to connect Bitcoin to their traditional offerings. Mr. Ludwin said that over the long term, Chain is more interested in harnessing the blockchain technology itself, which could eventually enable other decentralized systems beyond Bitcoin. (The company chose not to include a reference to Bitcoin in its name for that reason.) The company plans to use its latest money to expand its engineering team. “This sort of lays the foundation,” Mr. Ludwin said. “Now, we want to go build a house.”",0.25750000000000006,0.08209478323608758

Since the beginning of the year, a number of well-known retailers, including Overstock, Expedia and Dell, have started accepting Bitcoin for domestic sales through their websites. Now, Overstock is preparing to allow international customers to pay in Bitcoin as well, becoming the biggest merchant to extend the payment option beyond the United States market. On Sept. 1, Overstock plans to introduce a new payments system on its international website, O.co, that will allow customers to make purchases using the virtual currency, said Patrick Byrne, the company’s chief executive. The company started taking Bitcoin payments in January from domestic customers. “I know that’s it’s become part of the Bitcoin lore in the United States to shop on Overstock,” said Mr. Byrne, who has made no secret of his support for the virtual currency. “My hope is that would happen at a global level.”  Many small, more obscure merchants already accept Bitcoin for cross-border transactions. But the move by popular retailers like Overstock into the international space could foretell a more widespread adoption of the virtual currency as a viable payment option.  Dell, for example, which began allowing United States customers and small business to pay with Bitcoin in July, said it wanted to gauge the initial interest in the currency before planning its next steps, which could include rolling out the payment option internationally. “We wanted to expose this to our customers and see what the uptake was,” said Paul Walsh, the chief information officer of Dell Commerce Services.  A desire to test the United States market before committing to wider acceptance of the currency may be the reason more merchants have not yet extended the payment option to international customers, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “If you’re a big retailer, and you’re trying to embrace a new technology, you’re going to want to be able to do it gradually,” he said, adding that the benefits for merchants once they do start accepting Bitcoin internationally are significant.  Accepting Bitcoin could make international payments easier for companies because it eliminates the need for currency translation. That, coupled with lower payment processing fees associated with digital money, could result in savings for retailers and consumers of up to 8 percent, Mr. Luria said. Though Bitcoin’s value has been slumping recently, merchants like Overstock are not affected  because they accept the currency through a third-party payment processor, which converts the sales to dollars.  Yet even as more merchants are embracing Bitcoin, consumers may still be wary of transacting with the virtual currency. The total number of daily Bitcoin transactions has lingered around 60,000 since the beginning of the year, and consumers paying with currency make up a meager percentage of total sales for companies like Expedia and Overstock. For example, Mr. Byrne said that only about a quarter of 1 percent of Overstock’s sales were in Bitcoin — that’s about $12,000 to $15,000 a day in transactions. He expects the company, which had $1.3 billion in total sales in 2013, to record $6 million to $8 million in domestic Bitcoin sales this year and was optimistic that it could pull in an additional $2 million internationally. Because Overstock anticipates saving money on processing fees by accepting Bitcoin, Mr. Byrne also said the company intended to give 4 percent of its Bitcoin sales to various foundations that support the adoption of the currency. Eventually, Mr. Byrne said, he intends to pass on some of Overstock’s savings to the consumer as well. “Bitcoin saves us so much money that we want to help the community,” he said.",0.3168785714285714,0.05311147186147186

On Monday, the price of Bitcoin dropped nearly 12 percent, to $435.60 from $492.95, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk, its lowest value since May and far below its peak of about $1,150 last year. Also on Monday, the price briefly plummeted to $309 on BTC-e, an exchange with shadowy backing, in what some in the industry called Bitcoin’s version of a “flash crash.” That collapse, however, was short-lived, and the price quickly recovered to where it was trading before. The virtual currency also regained some of its lost ground to return to trading around $460 late Monday. Yet, despite the latest one-day swing, Bitcoin’s price has been steadily falling in recent weeks, a trend that follows a period of relative stability since February when the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsed. It also is occurring as new regulations and a general stock market malaise have taken hold. In July, New York became the first state  to propose regulations  for virtual currency companies. The regulations, introduced by the Department of Financial Services, include rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A “BitLicense” would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers, which some supporters fear is much too broad. Last week, another regulatory agency, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  issued a warning  on virtual currency, further igniting fear in the Bitcoin world over possible restrictions. “Over all, the sense is that regulation is going to impede the growth of Bitcoin, which is contributing the negative sentiment,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “What’s been weighing on Bitcoin more are shorter-term concerns about whether Bitcoin can develop.” Those who are familiar with the virtual currency sector shrugged off the latest price movement, which they said was well within the typical range for the currency. “This is just how Bitcoin trades, for better or worse,” said Barry E. Silbert, who oversees a Bitcoin investment fund through his company, SecondMarket. “This is normal — par for the course.” Bitcoin’s wild price swings, however, can be jarring, particularly for those who are new to virtual currency. Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, its value has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. On any day, the currency’s price can fluctuate by more than 5 percent. What makes the recent decline notable is the relative calm that preceded it. The price has hovered around $600 since June and has not fallen below $500 since May, according to CoinDesk. “What was surprising in some ways was the period when Bitcoin was trading around $600 and not losing much price,” said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. “The stability probably means that there isn’t much going on.” Bitcoin is not the only alternative currency to decline in recent days. So-called altcoins — including Litecoin, which has the second-highest market capitalization behind Bitcoin — have fallen in value across the board, according to the website CoinMarketCap. Analysts and seasoned Bitcoin supporters may not be concerned about the recent dive, but the volatility is probably not helping push the currency into the mainstream, analysts said. Unlike investors, who often bet on such price swings, more casual users are less likely to adopt a currency with such an unpredictable value. “The range of fluctuations in Bitcoin has a dampening effect on consumer enthusiasm,” Mr. Luria said. This could spell trouble for the growing list of merchants, including Overstock and Dell, that have started accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. Retailers are immune to Bitcoin’s volatility because they accept the currency through a third-party payment processor, which immediately converts it to dollars. Consumers who transact in Bitcoin, however, must hold some of the currency, making them susceptible to any price change. Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, it has become increasingly more popular, particularly among investment companies and entrepreneurs. But consumers have remained reluctant to embrace the currency, partly because of its unpredictable price. And analysts and investors, for the most part, do not expect this volatility to end soon. They cite the wide range of possible outcomes for the currency, so any small change in perception can drive a big price swing. In 10 years, for example, one Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars if it becomes the global capital of trade. But it could also be worth next to nothing if its development is stanched by strict oversight. “It’s very hard to come up with a fundamental value for Bitcoin,” said Mr. Englander, the Citigroup analyst. “What really defines the price is its reputation and expectations for the future.”",0.0725925,0.05076185966810968

So when he wanted a white linen suit for a vacation trip to Panama, he turned to Overstock.com, a discount retailer that accepted the virtual currency. The suit he selected cost about $100 — or a little more than a tenth of a Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is essentially just online cash,” he said. “You should be able to pay for things however you want to pay for them.” Merchants that accept Bitcoin are trying to attract virtual currency enthusiasts like Mr. Hand, 37, of Boulder, Colo. And the number of merchants has been growing. Since January, major retailers like Overstock, the online travel booking website Expedia, the computer maker Dell and the satellite television provider Dish Network have started allowing customers to pay using the virtual currency on their websites. Bitcoin supporters view the more widespread adoption of Bitcoin by popular companies as an important step toward pushing the currency into the mainstream. Yet even as more retailers are beginning to embrace digital money, the number of consumers using Bitcoin to make purchases has remained small. There are benefits for merchants in offering Bitcoin as a payment option — lower processing fees rank high on the list — but some have questioned whether accepting virtual currency amounts to anything more than a marketing gimmick. “From the store’s viewpoint, I think it’s great publicity,” said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. “It makes you edgy.” Despite the increase in merchants that accept Bitcoin, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions has hovered around 60,000 since the beginning of the year, according to the website Blockchain.info. Overstock, which began taking Bitcoin as a form of payment in January, said that only about a quarter of a percent of its sales were in the virtual currency, or about $12,000 to $15,000 a day. With about $1.3 billion in total sales in 2013, Overstock was the first big-name merchant to adopt Bitcoin. Expedia, which had about $4.8 billion in revenue last year, also said that less than 1 percent of its sales had been in Bitcoin since it began accepting the currency in June. Dell, which started allowing Bitcoin payments on its website in July, declined to disclose specific figures about its Bitcoin sales but noted that its biggest transaction to date was for a server costing about $50,000, or 85 coins. One reason Bitcoin transactions have not yet taken off, experts say, is that the virtual currency does not provide obvious benefits for customers. In many ways, it is still easier to pay with a credit card or a PayPal account than with Bitcoin, especially at retailers like coffee shops or grocery stores. Transacting in Bitcoin is also riskier because consumers are not protected against virtual currency fraud, making it a less appealing option for those mindful of the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin trading platform that was based in Japan. “My sense is that a few consumers try to use it as much as they can, but most consumers don’t find it nearly as convenient as using a credit card,” Mr. Englander said about the currency. “You transact in Bitcoin because you love it, not because it gives you any major advantages.” Another potential disadvantage is that the price of a Bitcoin can be volatile. In about five years, the value of the virtual currency has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. It is now trading around $500, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk. When Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer, or group of programmers, it appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs, who operated outside the traditional financial system. More recently, it has become more popular, particularly among investment firms and entrepreneurs. But without government regulation, many are reluctant to use the virtual currency. For merchants, however, there is significant upside. It costs companies little to accept Bitcoin beyond first establishing a new payment channel. Processing fees for Bitcoin transactions are often much lower for retailers. When customers use a credit card or debit card, these fees can be around 3 percent. By contrast, Coinbase, a third-party payment processor that has teamed up with many of these big retailers to accept Bitcoin, charges a 1 percent processing fee after the first $1 million in sales. The chief executive of Overstock, Patrick Byrne, estimated that it cost about $100,000 to integrate Bitcoin into the site’s payment system, pennies compared with the millions of dollars it spends on advertising, for example. Michael Gulmann, the vice president of global product at Expedia, said: “We have costs associated with running our business. The lower we can get those costs, the better.” It is difficult to put an exact figure on the number of merchants that accept Bitcoin, but experts say the total globally is as many as 80,000. Big-name retailers like Expedia and Overstock get more attention, but most of these companies are mom-and-pop stores. Some say the interest among smaller businesses points to a mounting frustration with processing fees and chargebacks, which can hurt the bottom lines of local shops. “These are the businesses that are hit hardest by credit card fees,” said Adam White, the director of business development and strategy at Coinbase. “For them, Bitcoin isn’t a ‘nice to have,’ it’s the only option for them to survive.” Accepting Bitcoin may also be a marketing tactic. When retailers started accepting Bitcoin, a big appeal was the virtual currency’s ability to attract new customers with its novelty. Being among the first to embrace Bitcoin was an easy, relatively cheap way for companies to capitalize on interest in digital money, said Derek D. Rucker, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. “They’re not just manufacturing curiosity and interest, they’re borrowing interest,” he said about these retailers. “It’s possible they’re using their association with Bitcoin for different reasons, but clearly, it’s an attention-grabber.” Merchants like Overstock and Dell said they experienced an initial bump in activity on their sites after announcing they would accept Bitcoin, especially after they received media attention. Now, however, some see signs that there may be a bit of Bitcoin fatigue. Sales at Overstock, for example, have fallen considerably since its first week of Bitcoin transactions, when it had about $500,000 worth, said Mr. Byrne, Overstock’s chief executive. “There’s a corner of the market that wanted to use Bitcoin, and this was a chance to get that piece of the market before anyone else got to it,” Mr. Byrne said. “People who accept it now aren’t going to get nearly the publicity that we did.”",0.2143980769230769,0.1317606351981352

On Monday,  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its first consumer advisory on virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, and said it would begin accepting complaints about such issues or companies.The agency warns consumers to be aware of hackers and schemes, volatile exchange rates and a lack of government protection. “Virtual currencies may have potential benefits but consumers need to be cautious and they need to be asking the right questions,” Richard Cordray, the director of the bureau, said in a statement. “Virtual currencies are not backed by any government or central bank, and at this point, consumers are stepping into the Wild West when they engage in the market.” In the bulletin, the agency urges virtual currency users to pay attention to potential hidden costs associated with digital money. For one, the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. In about five years, the value of Bitcoin has gone from just a few dollars to over $1,000. It is now trading around $580, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk.  “This is positive for consumers,” said Mercedes Tunstall, a partner in the Washington office of the law firm Ballard Spahr, who has testified before Congress on digital money. “For virtual currencies, the average consumer doesn’t really know how to protect themselves, and they really cannot protect themselves.” Experts say a lack of government regulation has contributed to this price instability, preventing digital currency from becoming more mainstream. But some Bitcoin supporters say increased regulation could thwart innovation and threaten the freedom the currency was intended to promote. The agency also warns against the false assumption that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and urges consumers to be vigilant when transferring digital money and using virtual currency exchanges.  “Information about each and every Bitcoin transaction is publicly shared and stored forever,” the C.F.P.B.’s bulletin states. “It is possible that others will be able to estimate both how much Bitcoin you own and where you are.” When it was first introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin largely appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the traditional financial system. But as digital money, particularly Bitcoin, has become more popular, it has also caught the attention of government agencies, who are now grappling with how to regulate virtual currency. In March, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it would treat Bitcoin like property rather than currency for tax purposes. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have said the currency is risky but have not enacted regulations. Another issue has also been just how to enforce one country’s policies across nations. One of the most spectacular failures in the currency was the shutting down of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin trading platform that was based in Japan. Last month, New York became the first state to introduce proposed regulations for virtual currency companies. The “BitLicense” plan,  announced by Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top financial regulator, includes rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. The new rules are now out for public comment.",0.16226086956521737,0.06194447058577492
190,Bitcoin Foundation Seeks More Time to Address Virtual Currency Rules,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/bitcoin-foundation-seeks-more-time-to-address-virtual-currency-rules/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-08-06T13:17:51+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Big-name Bitcoin supporters are stepping up the pressure on New York State’s top financial regulator to extend the comment period for the state’s new virtual currency rules. On Tuesday, the Bitcoin Foundation sent a letter to Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s superintendent of financial services, asking for up to six months to provide feedback on the proposed regulations, and a minimum of 45 additional days.  “With some important, sophisticated exceptions, the Bitcoin community is not well-versed in New York financial services law or regulation,” the letter said. “It takes time to gather the meanings of legal terms of art and to compare them with emerging technologies, processes and business models in the Bitcoin world.” The move came a week after a group of virtual currency supporters sent a separate letter, which was signed by about 400 Bitcoin enthusiasts, requesting a similar extension of the comment period. The Bitcoin Foundation’s letter asked Mr. Lawsky’s office, the Department of Financial Services, to “adopt an iterative process” in which the department would issue multiple drafts of the legislation and take comments from interested parties. The letter calls for the department to “resist the constraints of administrative procedures developed in the era of postage stamps,” saying that the traditional comment process for legislative proposals is outdated. The foundation also requested a hearing to discuss the regulations. Of particular concern to the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, is that Mr. Lawsky’s draft legislation does not address the risks unique to digital currencies. “The Bitcoin community is not used to being a heavily regulated industry,” said Jim Harper, global policy counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin supporters may feel unable to comment on the proposed regulations “because the language doesn’t tell you what the goal is,” he added. To address the issue, the Bitcoin Foundation asked for a public document outlining Mr. Lawsky’s rationale for the proposed rules. Should his office not provide such material, the foundation asked Mr. Lawsky to treat the letter as a request under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. Mr. Lawsky’s office responded on Tuesday evening that it was considering the letter as such a request and would provide documents to the foundation within 20 business days. When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin found a following among anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Now, as virtual currency becomes more accepted in the mainstream, start-ups fear they may not have the resources to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial institutions. The regulations introduced by Mr. Lawsky’s office are intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York State and include rules on consumer protection, cybersecurity and the prevention of money laundering. A “BitLicense” would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers. Merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment would not have to apply for a license. Some Bitcoin supporters contend that New York’s proposed rules will affect not only virtual currency companies operating in the state, but also businesses across the United States and the globe. Virtual currency start-ups have also expressed concern that they will not be able to meet certain licensing requirements, some of which are stricter than those for other financial institutions like banks. Smaller businesses are wary of the extensive reporting rules, significant capital requirements and robust cybersecurity programs to obtain a license, which would require extensive resources that many of the start-ups do not have. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts, however, view the proposed rules as an important step toward legitimizing the virtual currency. The public currently has 45 days from July 23 to comment on the proposal, after which Mr. Lawsky’s office intends to make changes to the rules and send them back out for review for another 30 days. Mr. Lawsky said last week that he was willing to address concerns that it would be difficult for smaller companies to comply with the regulations. He also said he would consider extending the comment period.",0.20912647058823527,0.05050054112554112

Since New York became the first state to propose virtual currency regulations two weeks ago, Bitcoin enthusiasts have had a mixed reaction on whether the new rules will help legitimize the virtual currency or whether they will thwart innovation and threaten the very freedom that Bitcoin was meant to promote. The draft legislation has also exposed a division among virtual currency companies with enough resources to comply with the regulations and those without. On Tuesday, some Bitcoin supporters are planning to send an open letter to Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top financial regulator, requesting more time to comment on his proposed legislation.  “Many of us are individuals or small start-ups operating on limited budgets without access to extensive legal resources,” the letter states. “This imposes a substantial burden as we seek to understand the proposed rules and their current and future impacts on our businesses, open-source projects and educational research.” The letter also refers to “inconsistent statements” and opaque language in the draft regulations. The letter, which has about 400 signatures, including many big names in the virtual currency industry, says the 45 days allotted for comments is not enough time for interested parties to provide adequate feedback on “both the broad scope and detailed components of the proposed rules.” The letter requests 45 additional days. “We really want to make this a collaborative and engaging process with regulators,” said Austin Walne, who wrote the letter. “We want to have a dialogue, and we want more time to have it.” A self-described technologist and Bitcoin enthusiast, Mr. Walne teamed up last week with Elizabeth Stark, an entrepreneur, to gauge reaction to the letter. The response, they said, was overwhelming. Hundreds of people, including executives from Bitcoin companies backed by venture capital, as well as students and users of Reddit, signed the letter. Among those who have added their signatures are Barry Silbert of SecondMarket, who runs a Bitcoin investment fund, and executives from the Bitcoin company BitPay. When it was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin appealed to anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Now, as virtual currency becomes more accepted in the mainstream, start-ups could find themselves unable to comply with regulations that seem to favor more established financial companies. “If only companies that have already raised tens of millions of dollars in funding can succeed, we can say goodbye to the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem,” Ms. Stark wrote in an opinion article on TechCrunch last week. “In effect, New York’s proposed regulations will throw the baby out with the bathwater.” The regulations, introduced by Mr. Lawsky’s office, the Department of Financial Services, are intended for virtual currency companies operating in New York and include rules on consumer protection, the prevention of money laundering and cybersecurity. A “BitLicense” would be required for Bitcoin exchanges and for companies that secure, store or maintain custody or control of the virtual currency on behalf of customers. Merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment, like Overstock.com, would not need to apply for a license.  Mr. Lawsky said the rules, the product of a nearly yearlong review, are intended to inspire consumer confidence and promote commerce by encouraging more companies to come to New York.  Still, virtual currency start-ups have taken issue with the extent of the regulations, some of which are stricter than existing rules for traditional financial institutions. Opponents of the rules have argued that start-ups simply don’t have the resources to comply with certain licensing requirements, including onerous reporting rules, hefty capital requirements and robust cybersecurity programs.  “I think most people were surprised that it is such a broad, sweeping regulation,” said Jim Harper, global policy counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation. “It seems meant to create an entirely new regulatory regime for Bitcoin.” The public currently has 45 days from July 23 to comment on the proposal, after which Mr. Lawsky’s office intends to make changes to the rules and send them back out for review for another 30 days. So far, Mr. Lawsky said, his office has received “thousands of comments” on the proposed regulations. Though there has been vocal opposition to the rules, there is also a significant camp that considers the rules an important step to bringing Bitcoin and other computer-based currencies into the mainstream.  “This is a very good thing for Bitcoin,” Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said when the regulations were introduced. “It may end up being one of the most important milestones in the development of Bitcoin.” Mr. Lawsky said on Tuesday that he was willing to address concerns that the regulations as they stand would squeeze smaller companies. He said he would also consider extending the comment period. “This is certainly a unique situation where we’re trying to regulate in an evolving, high-tech, innovative environment, and we want to make sure we get it right,” Mr. Lawsky said. “We will certainly think through very carefully the very obvious comment that, when it’s a small start-up, they’re going to have less resources in terms of compliance.”",0.23946666666666663,0.13988070263070265

On Friday, Dell announced that customers would be able to make purchases on its website using Bitcoin, claiming to become the biggest retailer yet to accept the virtual currency. “We put this together quickly as a result of listening to our customers,” said David Frink, a Dell spokesman. “It’s another way for customers to have a relationship with Dell.” When retailers started accepting Bitcoin, the appeal was largely the currency’s ability to attract new customers with its novelty. But as Bitcoin has become more mainstream, merchants may now be embracing digital money to lower payment processing fees and make purchases easier for already-loyal customers. “Retailers have very low margins, and online especially, and they’re in a constant battle with credit cards and banks to lower those fees,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “Now that they see this avenue for fees to go away, that’s really their big motivation.” To make accepting Bitcoin possible, Dell teamed up with Coinbase, a third-party payment processor that converts customers’ Bitcoins into dollars. Coinbase, which began with $25 million from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, approached Dell about accepting Bitcoin as a payment option a few months ago, said Adam White, the director of business development and strategy at Coinbase, who worked with Dell on the partnership. Dell reached out to Coinbase two weeks ago about adopting Bitcoin quickly, in time for back-to-school shopping, he said. “Merchants are really waking up and seeing just how powerful using Bitcoin as a payment option is,” Mr. White said. “Adding Dell to our roster of merchants that accept Bitcoin is a great signal for the industry that Bitcoin is here to stay.” Dell, which offers products ranging like personal computers, tablets and printers, had annual sales of nearly $60 billion in 2013. Companies working with Coinbase pay it a 1 percent processing fee after the first $1 million in sales. About 35,000 merchants use Coinbase’s payment tools, Mr. White said, including Overstock.com, which began working with Coinbase in early January. The online travel booking website Expedia and the satellite television provider Dish Network have also partnered with Coinbase to accept Bitcoin. Despite a more widespread adoption of Bitcoin, it is not clear how many customers are using the currency to pay for goods and services. In its most recent quarterly filing, Overstock said that less than 1 percent of its sales were made in Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or a group of programmers, it appealed to a core group of anti-establishment enthusiasts and technology buffs, who operated on the fringes of the financial system. Since then, it has gained popularity, attracting venture capitalists and investment firms. But without government regulation, the mainstream has yet to fully embrace the virtual currency. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly, from a few cents to more than $1,000 at its peak. Its current price is about $625, according to the website CoinDesk. On Thursday, New York became the first state to propose regulations for virtual currency companies operating in New York. And with more merchants accepting Bitcoin, it may be only a matter of time before it is widely adopted as a viable form of payment. “If you’re a retailer, there’s really no reason not to accept Bitcoin at this point,” Mr. Luria said.",0.16377037037037037,0.1145930201485757

When the government auctioned nearly 30,000 Bitcoins on Friday, many bidders were looking for a bargain, hoping to buy the virtual currency at a discount and flip it later for a short-term profit. But the winner, the venture capitalist Tim Draper, is not seeking a quick hit, Sydney Ember reports. Instead, through a partnership with the Bitcoin exchange start-up Vaurum, Mr. Draper intends to make the coins available for use in emerging markets. “With the help of Vaurum and this newly purchased Bitcoin, we expect to be able to create new services that can provide liquidity and confidence to markets that have been hamstrung by weak currencies,” Mr. Draper said in a statement through Vaurum. “We want to enable people to hold and trade Bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies.” The United States Marshals Service, which organized the auction of the coins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road, confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Draper won the auction.

The Marshals Service announced on Tuesday that one bidder had won all the coins, but it did not identify the winner or disclose the winning bid. Avish Bhama, the co-founder and chief executive of Vaurum, said the goal was not to dump the 30,000 coins on the open market. Rather, he said that he and Mr. Draper hoped to expand Bitcoin’s use in areas of the world where access to the currency is difficult, including India, South America and parts of Asia. “This is a very long-term thesis that we have where we want to increase the supply and facilitate the usage of Bitcoin in emerging economies,” Mr. Bhama said. Mr. Draper was part of a group that invested $4 million in Vaurum in May. The company participated in a start-up accelerator program, Boost VC, run by Mr. Draper’s son Adam Draper. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders had taken part in the auction and that the agency had received 63 bids. A number of prominent names in the Bitcoin world, including Barry Silbert of SecondMarket, Pantera Bitcoin and Coinbase, submitted unsuccessful bids. Interest in the auction is the latest indication that Bitcoin is gaining popularity. When it first appeared online in 2009, Bitcoin, created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, appealed mostly to an anti-establishment following that wanted to avoid the banking system and government regulation. Like Mr. Draper, many entrepreneurs now see an opportunity, particularly in making financial transactions easier. “The venture capital community very much believes that there is a future in the implementation of Bitcoin technology,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin. “Having a stake in Bitcoin supports this vision of Bitcoin as helping create tools in emerging markets for consumers that don’t have access to the traditional banking network.” The price of Bitcoin has climbed since the auction closed, reaching a high of about $655 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The price fell slightly on Wednesday, to about $645. At the start of the auction, the price was about $570. Mr. Bhama declined to disclose Mr. Draper’s bid for the stash of coins, which is now worth about $19 million. Mr. Draper could not be reached for further comment. Experts are divided on what information about Mr. Draper’s bid, if any, can be gleaned from the price increase. Losing bidders may be driving up the price because they know there is significant demand for the coins at a higher price. The increase could also be the result of interest in the auction itself, said David L. Yermack, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Just the fact that there was such broad demand would tend to push up the value of Bitcoin,” he said. For the Marshals Service, which is responsible for selling property taken from criminals like cars and yachts, the auction was unfamiliar territory and was not without missteps. A list of potential bidders was accidentally released on June 18 in an email from the agency. And apparent typographical errors in the initial instructions posted on the Marshals Service’s website made it unclear when the registration deadlines were. Participants also said the auction process was vague, which experts said might have discouraged smaller parties from bidding. Bidders had a 12-hour window to submit one sealed offer for the coins, which have been broken up into lots of 3,000. Only about 20 percent of the coins that were seized from Silk Road were auctioned on Friday, and the auction could provide a road map for the Marshals Service if it decides to sell the rest. The Marshals Service said on Wednesday that it did not publicly discuss its internal auction processes. Regardless, experts said the fact that one participant bid high enough to take home all the coins was evidence that the auction had been a success. “They probably don’t regret this one bit,” Mr. Yermack said. “It’s probably viewed as a stroke of good fortune.”",0.15822745098039215,0.08425034660328777
195,After the Bitcoin Boom: Hard Lessons for Cryptocurrency Investors,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/technology/cryptocurrency-investor-losses.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-08-20T09:00:07+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Pete Roberts of Nottingham, England, was one of the many risk-takers who threw their savings into cryptocurrencies when prices were going through the roof last winter. Now, eight months later, the $23,000 he invested in several digital tokens is worth about $4,000, and he is clearheaded about what happened. “I got too caught up in the fear of missing out and trying to make a quick buck,” he said last week. “The losses have pretty much left me financially ruined.” Mr. Roberts, 28, has a lot of company. After the latest round of big price drops, many cryptocurrencies have given back all of the enormous gains they experienced last winter. The value of all outstanding digital tokens has fallen by about $600 billion, or 75 percent, since the peak in January, according to data from the website coinmarketcap.com. The virtual currency markets have been through booms and busts before — and recovered to boom again. But this bust could have a more lasting impact on the technology’s adoption because of the sheer number of ordinary people who invested in digital tokens over the last year, and who are likely to associate cryptocurrencies with financial ruin for a very long time. “What the average Joe hears is how friends lost fortunes,” said Alex Kruger, a former banker who has been trading in the cryptocurrency markets for some time. “Irrational exuberance leads to financial overhang and slows progress.” It is hard to know how many cryptocurrency investors are now in the red, with holdings worth less than the money they put in. Many who have lost money in recent months had gotten into the markets before the big run-up last year, and their holdings are still worth more than their initial investments. But by many metrics, more people put money into virtual currencies last fall and winter than in all of the preceding nine or so years. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency brokerage in the United States, doubled its number of customers between October and March. The start-up Square began allowing the users of its mobile app, Square Cash, to buy Bitcoin last November. Almost all of the new customers on Coinbase and Square would be in the red if they bought cryptocurrencies at almost any point over the last nine months and held on to them. The damage is likely to be particularly bad in places like South Korea and Japan, where there was minimal cryptocurrency activity before last year, and where ordinary investors with little expertise jumped in with abandon. In South Korea, the biggest exchanges opened storefronts to make investment easier for people who didn’t feel comfortable doing it online. The offices of one big exchange, Coinone, had just one customer walk in during a two-hour period in the middle of the day last week. An employee, Yu Ji-Hoon, said, “The prices of the digital tokens have fallen so much that people seem to feel upset.” Kim Hyon-jeong, a 45-year-old teacher and mother of one who lives on the outskirts of Seoul, said she put about 100 million won, or $90,000, into cryptocurrencies last fall. She drew on savings, an insurance policy and a $25,000 loan. Her investments are now down about 90 percent. “I thought that cryptocurrencies would be the one and only breakthrough for ordinary hardworking people like us,” she said. “I thought my family and I could escape hardship and live more comfortably, but it turned out to be the other way around.” In the United States, Charles Herman, a 29-year-old small-business owner in Charleston, S.C., became obsessed with virtual currencies in September. He said he now felt that he had wasted 10 months of his life trying to play the markets. While he is essentially back to the $4,000 he put in, he has soured on the revolutionary promises that virtual currency fanatics made for the technology last year and has resumed investing his money in real estate. “I guess I thought we were ‘sticking it to the man’ when I got on board,” Mr. Herman said. “But I think ‘the man’ had already caught on, and had an exit strategy.” Much of the anger that investors feel is toward the smaller virtual currencies, or alt coins, that entrepreneurs sold in so-called initial coin offerings. These coins were supposed to serve as payment mechanisms for new software the entrepreneurs were building. But almost none of these companies have delivered the software they promised, leaving the tokens useless, except as speculative assets. Several coins have been exposed as outright scams. “I think I’d like to see most alts go to zero before I feel like the whole space isn’t overpriced,” Mr. Herman said. Bitcoin has generally held on better with investors. It is down about 70 percent from all-time highs, rather than the 90-percent losses that lesser-known digital tokens have suffered. But it, too, has struggled to win much use beyond speculative investments. “We also saw that Bitcoin isn’t ready for mass adoption and day-to-day use,” Mr. Herman said. Despite this pessimism, the social networks where cryptocurrency fanatics gather to trade information are full of people talking about their intention to hold on to their coins, in the hope that they will recover once the technology has time to catch up with the hype. Tony Yoo, 26, a financial analyst in Los Angeles, invested more than $100,000 of his savings last fall. At their lowest point, his holdings dropped almost 70 percent in value. But Mr. Yoo is still a big believer in the idea that these tokens can provide a new way to transact online, without the big corporate middlemen we rely on today. Many of the groups that raised money last year are still working on the products they promised, with lots of serious engineers drawn to the projects. “There’s just so much more behind this new wave of technology and innovation that I’m sure will take over our society in due time,” Mr. Yoo said. With prices down so much, he said he was actually looking to put more money into the markets. That thinking has been encouraged by the people who invested in Bitcoin in 2013, when it first topped $1,000. That bull market was followed by a crash in which the price of Bitcoin dropped more than 80 percent. But after a long fallow period, the price recovered. Even with recent losses, the value of one Bitcoin was hovering around $6,300 on Monday — up more than 500 percent from the peak of 2013. “Five years ago, I was broke, unemployed, and ashamed to use my real name,” Ryan Selkis, a popular virtual currency personality, wrote on Twitter last week. “For the new fanatics, stick around for your own 14 month, 85% downdraft and you’ll not regret it.” Twitter is also filled with complaints, like the one from a user named @Notsofrugaljoey, who wrote: “It’s really hard to stomach losing all my hard earned money. Just broke down and cried.” On Reddit, a user in the United Arab Emirates posted a picture of the $100,000 loan that he had taken out in December to buy cryptocurrencies — and that he will now be paying back out of his salary for the next three years. Mr. Roberts, the British investor who has seen most of his $23,000 vanish, is holding on to his coins in case they turn around. But for now he has stopped trading and is looking for another job. “I’m living off the little savings I have left still in my bank account,” Mr. Roberts said. “I’ve made a mistake, and now I’m going to have to unfortunately pay the cost for the next few years.”",0.029062295081967206,0.06508525930657078

The deadline for winning bidders to transfer funds to the agency, according to the website, was 5 p.m. on Tuesday. At least a handful of bidders were sent emails on Monday notifying them that they had not won the auction. So far, many prominent bidders have said they were outbid, including a syndicate run by SecondMarket, Pantera Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Shop and Coinbase. Rangeley Capital and Alex Waters at CoinApex also said they did not win any Bitcoins. “While we are disappointed that our syndicate did not emerge as a winner in the auction, we are pleased to see such strong interest from other bidders,” Barry Silbert, chief of SecondMarket, said in a statement on Monday. “The auction was a clear success and the result quite positive for Bitcoin.” Mr. Silbert said his syndicate had received 186 bids from 42 bidders. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders had participated in the event and that the agency had received 63 bids over the course of the auction.

Some bidders also said other aspects of the process had been vague. Mr. Waters, for example, said on Monday that he had bid on one block of 3,000 Bitcoins at $403 each, far below the market price of Bitcoin, because he thought syndicates would not be permitted by the Marshals Service.

The United States Marshals Service, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, arranged the online auction for 29,656 of the Bitcoins seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road. The site was shut in October and has been accused of aiding the sale of illegal goods and services. Bidders had a 12-hour window on Friday to submit one sealed bid for the coins, which had been broken up into lots of 3,000. The Marshals Service said on Monday that 45 registered bidders participated in the event, and that the agency received 63 bids over the course of the auction. Beyond that, the agency has said from the beginning of the auction process that it will not reveal the names of the winning bidders or the amount of the winning bids. The Marshals Service declined to comment further on Monday because the award process was ongoing.  Still, some names of bidders have trickled out, including Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor; Rangeley Capital, a value investment fund; and Alex Waters, the chief executive and co-founder of CoinApex, a Bitcoin-focused start-up.  Even as the names of those who submitted bids became public, most bidders remained largely tight-lipped about their bids. Chris DeMuth Jr., a partner at Rangeley Capital, said he had bid below the market price, but, like most participants thus far, would not comment on his exact bid.  “It’s more about the process and the potential for the price than it is about anything intrinsic to the Bitcoins,” Mr. DeMuth said. He said he was outbid.  As of Monday evening, DealBook had not yet determined the winner or winners of the auction. Since the auction closed, the price of Bitcoin has climbed to about $639 as of Monday evening, up from about $570 when the auction began, according to CoinDesk. But experts were divided on whether the rise in price provided any indication about the bids. After the auction closed, some bidders were in communication with each other, and a jump in price could indicate that they were driving up the price, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin.  Bidders “probably have more information than the market does, and that could explain why the market is up,” he said. The price fluctuation is also within the normal range for Bitcoin, he added.  The increase in price could also have been a red herring, said Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup. “People who bid and who are successful in their bidding obviously would like the market to think that the price was high rather than low,” he said. Mr. Waters of CoinApex, who bid as an individual, appeared to send his bid using his cellphone while live on Bloomberg Television on Friday, but later confessed in an interview that he had forgotten to attach the bidding form to his email. He submitted his bid for one block of Bitcoins, at a price of $403 each, later on Friday afternoon. He, too, did not win.  “I was anticipating a lot of the other bidders getting disqualified because it seemed to me that the Marshals Service didn’t want syndicates bidding,” Mr. Waters said, referring to the agency’s intense screening process. “It was sort of just a fun thing. I took a gamble.”",0.1206861111111111,0.060177569344236

But there was just one problem. The money was in Bitcoin. And since last fall, the government has been trying to figure out how it can sell it for the maximum amount. The federal government is responsible for selling property taken from criminals, including cars, yachts and fine jewelry. But Bitcoin, a computer-driven virtual currency that exists entirely online, is neither fish nor fowl. If the government dumped all the coins on the open exchanges where Bitcoins are bought and sold, it could significantly depress their price. So instead, with help from the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the United States Marshals Service has arranged an online auction for nearly 30,000 of the Bitcoins it seized from the now-defunct market Silk Road, which federal prosecutors shut in October and have accused of aiding the sale of cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal goods and services. “Selling Bitcoin with its somewhat liquid market is not the same as auctioning off a 1998 Chevy with a couple of bullet holes in the driver’s door,” Steven Englander, a research analyst with Citigroup, wrote in a note on Wednesday. Experts are divided on whether an auction of that many Bitcoins, which represent a substantial percentage of the average daily trading volume, will push the price down anyway. Furthermore, the auction’s setup has been an opaque and, at times, slapdash process. A list of potential bidders was accidentally released on June 18 in an email from the agency, which had said that it would not release any information about the bidders or winning bids. “The U.S. marshal specifically has never had to auction off this type of asset,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin. “They’re figuring it out for the first time, and maybe that’s why the process hasn’t been completely transparent.” The government has provided some details about the process. Bidders will have a 12-hour window on Friday to submit one sealed bid for the coins, which have been broken up into lots of 3,000. The winners will be notified on Monday. Only about 20 percent of the Bitcoins that were seized from Silk Road will be auctioned, providing a test run if the government decides to sell the rest. The authorities are also concerned with Bitcoin’s potential to be used for illegal activity, and the agency screened potential bidders. Bidders had to prove their identities and that they had at least $200,000 in cash. They also had to certify that they were not affiliated with Silk Road or its founder, Ross Ulbricht. But for bidders, the auction process was less transparent. Questions about the auction from would-be bidders were answered only in writing by a general email inbox. And apparent typographical errors in the initial instructions posted on the Marshals Service’s website made it unclear when the registration deadlines were. Some bidders also said other aspects of the process had been vague. Drew Wade, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said: “There are necessary privacy and security measures that the Marshals Service has to take.” He continued: “In particular, cases involving complex assets.” The problems, particularly the accidental release of names, could affect how much money the government raises from what it hoped would be an efficient auction. In the days after the leak, people on the recipient list exchanged emails with one another, turning what should have been an anonymous communication into an open forum. “The leak has definitely changed the dynamics,” said Charles Allen, the chief executive of the Bitcoin Shop, whose name was on the list. The mistake also spurred unease among recipients of the message, he added. “People have been very concerned about their privacy,” Mr. Allen said. The leaked list included prominent names in the Bitcoin world like the payment processor Coinbase and the entrepreneur Barry Silbert, which could scare off smaller bidders from participating, some experts said. On the flip side, it could also entice other wealthy investors who do not want to sit on the sidelines. “Either this was a very clever piece of disinformation or a very careless error by the government. It’s a little hard to know which from a distance,” David L. Yermack, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said of the leak. “You want to create the illusion that there’s immense demand for this if you’re the government because you want people to bid as much as they’re willing to.” The Marshals Service made it clear publicly that the leak was unintentional. Bitcoin, created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, at the height of the financial crisis, appealed to an anti-establishment following that liked the idea of avoiding the banking system and government regulation. Users can either buy Bitcoins from one another or “unlock” them by solving complicated mathematical algorithms. Since Bitcoin first appeared online in 2009, the price has fluctuated wildly, from a few pennies to over a thousand dollars at its peak. The original programmers intended to create a finite number of Bitcoins, which could make acquiring large quantities difficult. Over the years, however, Bitcoin has reached a broader audience thanks to the public backing of technologists, venture capitalists financing Bitcoin enterprises and retailers accepting payment in Bitcoin. It is that audience the Marshals Service hopes to tap in its auction. Because of some of the missteps and the unprecedented nature of the auction, estimating how much the government will raise is difficult. The Marshals Service often conducts sealed-bid sales, but auction experts say that can discourage bidders from participating. Some bidders said their strategy relied more on game theory than financial analysis. But game theory, in which players size up one another knowing that their opponents are doing the same, is much harder when the game is kept a secret. Because participants in the auction will not know the size of the bidding pool, they are likely to bid cautiously, said Lawrence M. Ausubel, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland and an auction theory expert. Bidders may be willing to pay a premium to acquire a big lot of Bitcoins. Mr. Silbert, the entrepreneur who runs a Bitcoin investment fund through his firm SecondMarket, said his bid would be determined by the bids from his clients, who were participating as part of a consortium. “We have no discretion,” Mr. Silbert said. “We are bidding based on where all the bids come in into our syndicate.” Because of Bitcoin’s volatility and lack of historical data, it is difficult to compare the auction of Bitcoin to the auction of Treasury bonds, or other financial instruments that trade openly. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price — it currently trades around $600 — will anchor Friday’s bids to some degree. “If it’s a Picasso, or if it’s an oil field where basically you don’t know what the correct price is, you might say that the Picasso is anywhere from a million to 10 million,” Mr. Englander said in an interview. “It’s not like a Treasury bond, where you could get the price to four decimal places.”",-0.02450655737704917,-0.009933734298488395

According to CoinDesk, an online website devoted to Bitcoin, the list of people who inquired about the auction include an “artist and musician” named Shem Booth, a business professor from Rowan University, Barry Silbert, the head of the online exchange SecondMarket, and Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of Coinbase, a Bitcoin payment processor. CoinDesk said that the United States Marshals Service had accidentally released the names in an email to update interested parties on the auction’s guidelines. A spokeswoman for the Marshals, Lynzey Donahue, released a statement confirming that the office had accidentally made the email addresses public, but did not confirm for whom. “The message was intended to blind copy everyone with an attached document that contained frequently asked questions and answers on the subject,” Ms. Donahue said. “The U.S.M.S. apologizes for this mistake, which was in no way intentional.” Some of the names on the list were not surprising. Mr. Silbert had already announced that he planned to create an investment vehicle to participate in the auction. Coinbase, which converts Bitcoin into dollars, may see the auction as an opportunity to buy Bitcoin on the cheap that it could then resell to its vast network of users A spokesman for Coinbase could not immediately be reached for comment. Indeed, many of the people who ultimately bid may be interested for similar reasons, according to Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. Mr. Luria speculated that several of the potential bidders, which include lawyers and investment groups, could be acting on behalf of a pool of investors who want to get their hands on Bitcoin below its current price of about $600. The list of interested parties, which also includes Luther Lowe, the director of public policy for Yelp,  may not be complete. Notably absent is Pantera Bitcoin, the new virtual currency fund that has backing from investors including the investment firm Fortress Investment Group. Pantera is participating in the auction, according to Dan Morehead, who founded Pantera Bitcoin’s parent company, Pantera Capital, in 2003. Mr. Lowe said that he had inquired about the auction as a “private investor,” and not on behalf of Yelp, according to an update to Coindesk’s story. The United States Marshals Service seized the 30,000 Bitcoins when the F.B.I. shut down Silk Road, the now-defunct virtual currency marketplace that federal prosecutors accused of facilitating drug deals and other illicit transactions. The coins are currently worth about $18 million, and represent less than 1 percent of the roughly 13 million currently in circulation. Some virtual currency enthusiasts have raised concerns that the Marshals’ auction could affect the value of the  digital money,  especially given that Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since it was first introduced in 2009. But Mr. Luria, the analyst, said he did not expect the price of Bitcoin to change significantly after the auction. “I think the market has had enough time to digest the supply that’s coming on board,” he said. The auction process began on Monday, and the Marshal’s office will notify winning bidders at the end of the month. Only 21 million Bitcoins exist in total, and several are released every few minutes through a process known as “mining.” Users unlock Bitcoins by solving complex, computer-driven algorithms. Created by an anonymous computer programmer, or group of programmers, Bitcoin has quickly been gaining popularity, even though it has not yet found a mainstream footing. The fledgling industry has attracted a growing list of investors banking on the wider adoption of virtual currency, even as enthusiasts continue to face  technological and regulatory challenges.  ",0.17265483870967743,0.045955522971652

BitGo, which sells a security platform to protect Bitcoin against theft and loss, said it had raised the money from investors including the Silicon Valley investment capital firm Redpoint Ventures; Bitcoin Opportunity Corporation, a Bitcoin investment vehicle run by the entrepreneur Barry Silbert; and Ashton Kutcher’s A-Grade Investments. Bitcoin, the computer-driven online currency, has no central regulator and is not secured by a national bank, meaning that investors have little recourse if their Bitcoin is lost or stolen. This lack of security has spurred the growth of a cottage industry aimed at providing protection to Bitcoin, thereby bringing it further into the mainstream.  In some ways, those efforts have succeeded, as more and more merchants have begun accepting Bitcoin as payment. But online money still faces regulatory and technological hurdles. It is still not widely used, and law enforcement agencies are wary of its potential for abuse. Investors are also concerned about security, especially in the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the dominant online exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin. The company went dark nearly overnight last February and announced that more than 700,000 Bitcoins had been lost, leaving users with few options to recover their money. Jeff Brody, a founding partner at Redpoint, said that wary Bitcoin investors needed the same assurances that VeriSign brought to e-commerce at the dawn of the Internet age, when users were first introduced to entering their banking data online.   “Until VeriSign came along and offered the certificate authority and infrastructure, that was a pretty difficult and dangerous thing to do,” Mr. Brody said on Monday. “We think that Bitcoin needs the same thing.” BitGo, based in Silicon Valley, says that it can protect users’ Bitcoin through a proprietary “multisignature” system — the equivalent of issuing multiple user “keys” that are required to unlock a Bitcoin account, much like a safe deposit box at a bank.  BitGo doesn’t want to just appeal to individual virtual currency speculators, however. The company says it wants to appeal to hedge funds, large corporations and other firms that may want to invest in Bitcoin, but need sophisticated security assurances to do so. “If users can’t trust that their holdings are secure, or that they can’t transact securely, then Bitcoin will never take off,” said Will O’Brien, BitGo’s chief executive. “Our focus is on making Bitcoin secure for commercial transactions.”",0.20005555555555554,0.06732804232804232

But that will not stop the company from accepting payments in the virtual currency later this year. Dish announced on Thursday that customers would be able to make manual payments in Bitcoin beginning in the third quarter. And while Dish may not be the first company to accept Bitcoin, it claims to be the largest — though the appeal of the payment option is still unclear. “We don’t know what the demand will be, exactly,” Bernie Han, Dish’s chief operating officer, said in an interview on Thursday. “It might be tiny. It might be bigger than tiny. It’s probably growing.” In fact, Bitcoin’s biggest appeal may be its ability to attract new customers. As enthusiasts try to push virtual currency further into the mainstream, digital money may offer companies cutting-edge appeal. “Accepting Bitcoin is about all these things — marketing, branding and acquiring new types of customers,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “I don’t think there are a lot of customers asking Dish for Bitcoin by name, but that doesn’t mean Dish won’t get some new customers now that they accept Bitcoin because those customers see Dish as a friendlier, more forward-thinking brand.” Retailers like Overstock.com and Virgin America already accept virtual currency, helped by new services that aim to make digital money easier to use. One such company is Coinbase, which began with $25 million from the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz. Coinbase acts as a third-party payment processor, converting customers’ Bitcoins into dollars. “We’re excited to support Dish and their current and new subscribers for their Bitcoin transactions,” Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, said in a statement. “This is a large step forward in the growing momentum of customers paying companies in Bitcoin for things we do every day, like watching premium TV.” But that does not mean those companies are seeing a flood of Bitcoins. Less than 1 percent of Overstock’s sales are made in Bitcoin, according to the company’s most recent quarterly filing. Users acquire Bitcoins by buying them from one another on online exchanges or by solving complicated mathematical equations to “mine” new coins. When it first appeared in 2009, Bitcoin offered a cheaper payment system that allowed people to bypass the banking industry. Since then, its following has expanded beyond technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment types to include more mainstream users. That soon attracted entrepreneurs looking to start new businesses and capitalize on a growing market. But the wider adoption has also drawn increased scrutiny to Bitcoin’s volatility and regulation. The price of a Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly, from a few cents in the beginning to more than $1,000 at its peak. Its current price is about $565, according to the online index CoinDesk. In February, Mt. Gox, a once-dominant online exchange for the virtual currency, collapsed amid a swirl of speculation that hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin had been stolen. The collapse, and the subsequent closure of the online marketplace Silk Road, prompted a scramble among regulators to impose rules that would protect consumers and prevent future illicit activity. But virtual-currency enthusiasts have said that the closing of some of Bitcoin’s early institutions could be a good thing. There may now be more room, they say, for sophisticated businesses to help Bitcoin gain a wider following, including from established companies like Dish. “It’s another big milestone,” Mr. Luria said of Dish’s announcement. “This is a mainstream company with mainstream leadership that’s decided to embrace Bitcoin and what Bitcoin technology offers.”",0.20325806451612904,0.12140078783223944

Some big start-ups are having trouble raising money. Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies like Bitcoin have been struggling.With all the nervous chatter out there — Where is this going? What’s next? — I called on Marc Andreessen, who has lived through a bubble or two (or three). Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicenter of the technology business here for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on Twitter, he sits on the board of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard. I got 28 minutes with him. But Mr. Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an hour and a half. Saying “bubble” to a venture capitalist around here is like saying “homework” to a teenager. They roll their eyes and try to shoo you away. So rather than ask if we are in the middle of another — ahem — bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can’t seem to raise all the money they want. His answer: conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available. “We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,” Mr. Andreessen said. “Actually, what we’re seeing is more of the opposite right now. We’re seeing a lot more institutional money — in particular from the hedge fund world — crossing over” into tech investing. But what about companies that can’t find their way to the stock market, like Box and Square? Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.) So if a start-up can’t go public just now, it’s no big deal. “The nature of the public market is that it is manic depressive,” Mr. Andreessen said. “It gets excited, it gets depressed.” Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can’t other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities ranging from Dublin to Berlin to New York often ask what they are doing wrong. Mr. Andreessen said new valleys will eventually emerge. But they won’t be Silicon Valley copycats. Over the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in start-ups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. Los Angeles, for example, is home to Snapchat, Tinder, Whisper, Oculus VR and Beats, some of the big tech stories of the year. Mr. Andreessen said another hot place is Atlanta, the home of Georgia Tech. But he offers a caveat. “My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that’s just a reflection that the fact that the valley works as well as it does,” Mr. Andreessen said. There is a caveat to his caveat. In Mr. Andreessen’s view, there shouldn’t be 50 Silicon Valleys. Instead, there should be 50 different kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields. If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unmanned aircraft. So what kind of valley would Marc Andreessen build? He is a big believer in digital currencies like Bitcoin, as well as in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality. Don’t believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a web browser. “They pretty much told us we were out of minds and to go away,” he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. Finally, I couldn’t end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. Over the past several months Mr. Andreessen has become a mantle on the social network, known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the “Marc Andreessen Tweetstorm.” So Mr. Andreessen, why the long tweets? “My view is that 140 characters doesn’t make sense anymore,” he said. “If it was me, I’d immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters.” But if that doesn’t happen, he’s incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is. “The counterargument is that there is magic to the limitation,” he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. “If Twitter doesn’t adapt, I would not view them as being stupid. I just hope they change it because it would be a lot better for me.”",0.0654953125,0.07617634210407648

Mr. Polis, a former technology entrepreneur and a current congressman from Colorado, has wasted no time in making his campaign more accessible to virtual currency enthusiasts. On Thursday, the same day that the Federal Election Commission said that it would allow such donations, his office announced that supporters could use Bitcoins to donate to Mr. Polis’s campaign for re-election in November. The F.E.C. was prompted by a request from Make Your Laws PAC, a political action committee based in North Carolina that says on its website that its mission “is to allow normal citizens to directly participate in every aspect of their legislative process, worldwide.”  In February, Make Your Laws sent the commission a letter requesting that it explain how donors could make campaign contributions using virtual currency, according to records on the F.E.C.’s website. A representative for Make Your Laws could not immediately be reached for comment. Once the territory of technology enthusiasts and anti-establishment libertarian types, Bitcoin has gained wider adoption, in part due to the growing number of businesses that are trying to bring virtual currency further into the mainstream. One such business is Coinbase, which acts as a middleman between merchants and consumers. Consumers can use Coinbase to exchange their Bitcoins into dollars for payments at a growing number of businesses, including Overstock.com and the online dating website OkCupid. Mr. Polis’s campaign is also using Coinbase to allow supporters to make donations, a spokesman for Coinbase, John O’Brien, confirmed. So far, the campaign has raised more than $1,000 in Bitcoin donations, according to Lisa Kaufmann, a campaign spokeswoman.  “One of those things that people do online is give to candidates, so we want to make that available to them,” Mr. Polis said in an interview on Friday, adding that the Bitcoin donations will be subject to all the same reporting requirements as donations given in dollars.  Mr. Polis said his campaign had been working to set up a Bitcoin payment site in anticipation of the F.E.C.’s ruling. Bitcoin, the computer-driven currency that requires solving complicated mathematical riddles, has no central bank or regulator. In recent months, it has come under scrutiny from federal authorities for its potential to aid money laundering and other illicit activities. Regulators are also concerned about the potential harm to investors. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an alert to warn investors about “the potential risks of investments involving Bitcoin and other forms of virtual currency.” That has made virtual currency somewhat controversial. But Mr. Polis, a Democrat who made a fortune as co-founder of the online greeting card website bluemountain.com, is not worried about potential negative attention. “Most illegal transactions for drugs or illegal weapons occur in dollars, and most politicians accept dollars,” he said.",0.051288,0.048400000000000006

Gox, one of the most prominent exchanges for buying and selling the virtual currency.  “A new product, technology, or innovation – such as Bitcoin – has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities,” the S.E.C. said in an alert posted to its website. “The fact that the S.E.C. has allowed the S-1 to progress this far is an indication that it may actually happen,” said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has studied Bitcoin, referring to the S.E.C. regulatory filing.  The Winklevoss brothers, who have emerged as two (or perhaps one) of the most public faces of Bitcoin, first applied to create the exchange-traded fund, called the Winklevoss Bitcoin trust, last summer. The goal is to provide investors of any size with an easy way to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, the volatile virtual currency that has gained momentum over the past several years.  They have invested in Bitcoin companies, including the exchange BitInstant, and at one point owned more than $64 million of virtual currency itself. In February, the twins started the Winkdex, their own index to measure the price of Bitcoin, to work in conjunction with their proposed Bitcoin E.T.F. According to the Winkdex, a single Bitcoin was worth $443 on Thursday afternoon. Coindesk, a more widely cited index, pegged the figure at $437. The Winklevoss’s proposed fund would buy one Bitcoin for every five shares. The company the two operate, Math-Based Asset Services, would be in charge of storing the fund’s Bitcoin holdings. The company has not yet decided how much its management fee will be.  A single Bitcoin was worth only a few cents when it first appeared online in 2009, largely backed by a small number of technology enthusiasts and cryptocurrency hobbyists. The wider adoption by both consumers and technology entrepreneurs helped the price skyrocket to more than $1,000 at one point last year.  But until recently, investors had few options for speculating on that price change. The currency, which can be bought and sold among users or “unlocked” by solving complicated mathematical riddles, has no central regulator or bank. Buying Bitcoins also comes with the hassle of storing Bitcoins, which can involve physically securing a virtual “key.” But the Winklevoss twins want to give investors an easier way into the market. Like SPDR, the widely used gold E.T.F., for example, investors would be able to invest in Bitcoin without having to actually buy and store the virtual currency. “Our goal with this whole thing was to make it as similar to the gold E.T.F. as possible,” Cameron Winklevoss said in an interview. “We’re trying to reduce the friction of purchasing Bitcoin and securing it.” But Mr. Luria sees Bitcoin’s wide price fluctuations as a risk for investors. Bitcoin isn’t the only commodity that trades 24 hours a day, but it does have wilder price shifts than many other assets.  “The price could decrease tremendously after the market closes, and you won’t be able to do anything about it,” Mr. Luria said.",0.179421875,0.11242076376004947
206,Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I’m a Crypto Skeptic,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/opinion/transaction-costs-and-tethers-why-im-a-crypto-skeptic.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-07-31T08:06:49+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"I’m still on vacation, hiking and biking in various parts of Europe. I’m keeping up with the news, more or less, but am only occasionally and unpredictably in a place and condition where I can actually write something and post it. But this is one of those times, and I thought I’d post some thoughts in advance of stuff I’ll be doing after I get back. Specifically, in a couple of weeks I’m going to play Emmanuel Goldstein — the designated enemy — at a conference on blockchain and all that. Hey, if you only speak to friendly audiences, you’re not challenging yourself enough. So I thought it might be worth explaining why I’m a cryptocurrency skeptic. It comes down to two things: transaction costs and the absence of tethering. Let me explain. If you look at the broad sweep of monetary history, there has been a clear direction of change over time: namely, one of reducing the frictions of doing business and the amount of real resources required to deal with those frictions. First there were gold and silver coins, which were heavy, required lots of security, and consumed a lot of resources to produce. Then came bank notes backed by fractional reserves. These were popular because they were much easier to deal with than bags of coins; they also reduced the need for physical precious metals, which, as Adam Smith said, provided “a sort of waggon-way through the air”, freeing up resources for other uses. Even so, the system still required substantial amounts of commodity money. But central banking, in which private banks held their reserves as deposits at the central bank rather than in gold or silver, greatly reduced this need, and the shift to fiat money eliminated it almost completely. Meanwhile, people gradually shifted away from cash transactions, first toward payments by check, then to credit and debit cards and other digital methods. Set against this history, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies seems very odd, because it goes exactly in the opposite of the long-run trend. Instead of near-frictionless transactions, we have high costs of doing business, because transferring a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency unit requires providing a complete history of past transactions. Instead of money created by the click of a mouse, we have money that must be mined — created through resource-intensive computations. And these costs aren’t incidental, something that can be innovated away. As Brunnermeier and Abadi point out, the high costs — making it expensive to create a new Bitcoin, or transfer an existing one — are essential to the project of creating confidence in a decentralized system. Banknotes worked because people knew something about the banks that issued them, and these banks had an incentive to preserve their reputation. Governments have occasionally abused the privilege of creating fiat money, but for the most part governments and central banks exercise restraint, again because they care about their reputations. But you’re supposed to be sure that a Bitcoin is real without knowing who issued it, so you need the digital equivalent of biting a gold coin to be sure it’s the real deal, and the costs of producing something that satisfies that test have to be high enough to discourage fraud. In other words, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are effectively celebrating the use of cutting-edge technology to set the monetary system back 300 years. Why would you want to do that? What problem does it solve? I have yet to see a clear answer to that question. Bear in mind that conventional money generally does its job quite well. Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable – orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens. So why change to a form of money that works far less well? Indeed, eight years after Bitcoin was launched, cryptocurrencies have made very few inroads into actual commerce. A few firms will accept them as payment, but my sense is that this is more about signaling — look at me, I’m cutting-edge! — than about real usefulness. Crypocurrencies have a large market valuation, but they’re overwhelmingly being held as a speculative play, not because they’re useful as mediums of exchange. Does this mean that crypto is a pure bubble, which will eventually deflate to nothing? It’s worth pointing out that there are other currency-like assets that don’t actually get much use as money, but which people hold anyway. Gold hasn’t been actual money for a very long time, yet it retains its value. And the same can be said, to a large extent, of cash. While cash transactions are common, they account for only a small and declining fraction of the value of purchases. Yet dollar cash holdings have actually risen as a share of GDP since the 1980s — a growth entirely accounted for by $50 and $100 bills: Now, large-denomination notes aren’t regularly used for payments — in fact, many stores won’t accept them. So what’s all that cash holding about? We all know the answer: tax evasion, illicit activity, etc. And much of that is outside the U.S., with estimates suggesting that foreigners hold more than half of U.S. currency. Clearly, cryptocurrencies are in effect competing for some of the same business: very few people are using Bitcoin to pay their bills, but some people are using it to buy drugs, subvert elections, and so on. And the examples of both gold and large-denomination banknotes suggest that this kind of demand could support a lot of asset value. So does this mean that crypto, even if it isn’t the transformative technology its backers claim, may not be a bubble? Well, this is where tethering — or, more precisely, its absence for cryptocurrencies — comes in. In normal life, people don’t worry about where the value of green pieces of paper bearing portraits of dead presidents comes from: we accept dollar notes because other people will accept dollar notes. Yet the value of a dollar doesn’t come entirely from self-fulfilling expectations: ultimately, it’s backstopped by the fact that the U.S. government will accept dollars as payment of tax liabilities — liabilities it’s able to enforce because it’s a government. If you like, fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do. And this means that their value isn’t a bubble that can collapse if people lose faith. And the value of those $100 bills sitting in drug lords’ lairs or whatever is in turn tethered to the value of smaller denominations back in America. To some extent gold is in a similar situation. Most gold just sits there, possessing value because people believe it possesses value. But gold does have real-world uses, both for jewelry and for things like filling teeth, that provide a weak but real tether to the real economy. Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, have no backstop, no tether to reality. Their value depends entirely on self-fulfilling expectations — which means that total collapse is a real possibility. If speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins would become worthless. Will that happen? I think it’s more likely than not, partly because of the gap between the messianic rhetoric of crypto and the much more mundane real possibilities. That is, there might be a potential equilibrium in which Bitcoin (although probably not other cryptocurrencies) remain in use mainly for black market transactions and tax evasion, but that equilibrium, if it exists, would be hard to get to from here: once the dream of a blockchained future dies, the disappointment will probably collapse the whole thing. So that’s why I’m a crypto skeptic. Could I be wrong? Of course. But if you want to argue that I’m wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve? Don’t just try to shout down the skeptics with a mixture of technobabble and libertarian derp.",0.12827666666666668,0.04690424332611832
207,Election Commission Votes to Allow Bitcoin Donations,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/us/politics/election-commission-votes-to-allow-bitcoin-donations.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-05-08T20:24:54+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Election Commission on Thursday voted to allow political committees to accept Bitcoin donations and outlined the ways that the virtual currency can be used by federally regulated campaigns. Responding to a request from a political action committee, the commissioners unanimously approved an advisory opinion that defined Bitcoins, which allows for online transactions without going through a bank or other third party, as “money or anything of value” — in essence, cash or an in-kind contribution. They also imposed some restrictions, ruling that Bitcoin donations will be capped at a cash equivalent of $100 per person per cycle, with the value determined at the time of the donation, and that a complete accounting of name, address and employer must accompany the donation. Committees can liquidate a Bitcoin contribution immediately, or they can choose to keep it as an investment, in the same way they do with stocks and bonds. Since the value of the virtual currency can fluctuate suddenly, the opportunity for a windfall is real, but is growing rarer as it stabilizes. The opinion also allows committees to buy Bitcoins on the open market, but prohibits them from using the coins to pay for goods or services. They must be liquidated into United States currency before being spent. “Clearly, for me it’s significant that the requester has only asked for $100 in Bitcoin contributions,” said Ann M. Ravel, the vice chairwoman of the commission. “And so it is good that we can give some guidance to the community in respect to that amount of money that is not going to raise some of the bigger issues that might come with Bitcoin transactions.” Lee Goodman, the commission’s chairman, released a separate statement explaining why he voted yes and laying out the remaining issues. In the end, he wrote, he supported the opinion because it “lays a foundation for the use of Bitcoins specifically and new technologies generally within the commission’s well established regulatory framework.” The ruling is both an acknowledgment of the currency’s growing popularity and a move to protect against efforts to circumvent campaign finance laws. Bitcoins can be difficult to trace, potentially opening the gates to both illegal and foreign money. Although the opinion provides some clarity for campaign committees, it is not likely to lead to a deluge of Bitcoin donations. “Besides the compliance burden, it’s an invitation for a headache,” said David Mitrani, an associate at Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock in Washington who specializes in federal and state campaign finance law. “It’s creating more work where potentially you wouldn’t have to create more work.” But, he added, “should a committee really wish to accept Bitcoin, the F.E.C. has actually laid out a clear path to do so.” Still, the introduction of a new source of financing could be important to some smaller campaigns and committees, especially those with significant backing from libertarians, who have embraced the currency. The Libertarian Party has already built a small but loyal Bitcoin donor base, receiving $10,000 to $20,000 a year in the currency. Bitcoin had occupied a gray area in campaign finance after the commission deadlocked on a ruling in November. No current federal law or regulation prohibits virtual currencies in campaigns. Representative Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican and a Bitcoin enthusiast, accepted Bitcoin contributions to his primary campaign against Senator John Cornyn this year. Greg Abbott, a Republican candidate for governor in Texas, announced last month that he would be accepting Bitcoins, and he already has a few in his campaign war chest. And Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, announced after the ruling that he would begin accepting Bitcoins for his re-election campaign. “Our campaign has focused on making use of cutting-edge tools to communicate online and has made digital a priority from the start,” said Matt Hirsch, Mr. Abbott’s communications director. “Something as innovative as Bitcoins is an opportunity for us to continue this focus, particularly given the fact that it embodies free market principles, which Texans are very fond of.” Other politicians see accepting Bitcoin donations as part of a grander message. “In the broadest sense possible, it’s a democratic currency,” said Bryan Parker, a candidate for mayor in Oakland, Calif. “I want all people to have the chance to participate. For me, it says by being open to other payment systems, it says you’re open to innovation.” Those in the political technology sector have also been preparing for the introduction of Bitcoins into the political sphere. Targeted Victory, a digital strategy firm that does work for Republicans, helped the Abbott campaign set up its Bitcoin operation. NGP VAN, a technology company for Democratic and liberal candidates, has developed a Bitcoin integration for its applications and had been waiting for further guidance from the election commission before releasing it. And CoinVox, a start-up founded to enable the use of Bitcoins in politics, has already received interest from federal candidates. The ruling did not specifically allow or prohibit unlimited Bitcoin donations by “super PACs,” and the rules are expected to continue to develop along with the infant currency.",0.255234375,0.03717521194083694

Both are rooted in an ethos that spurns government intervention and oversight. 2. Each exists in a place with a distinctive language, culture and value system. For Bitcoin, it’s cyberspace. For “Down East Dickering,” it’s Maine. 3. No one understands how either works. “Down East Dickering” features scruffy New Englanders, most from Maine, engaging in economic transactions for goods of dubious value: a rusting tractor, a beat-up blue 1960s school bus, an old vending machine. Sometimes an exchange involves cash; at other times, the payment is in services, like building a footbridge or providing a tow.  Television has other I’ll-give-you-this-for-that reality shows, of course, but a lot of them speak in a Southern lilt. The Down East accent here is by itself a refreshing change. These scraggly guys, though, are also considerably more comfortable on camera than many of their Southern cousins. Along with the Beaver Brothers — trappers from Nova Scotia seen on an Animal Planet series of that name — they may be the most appealing new backwoods TV characters of 2014. They also affirm that the reality-TV war has broadened into a three-cornered conflict. The Southern contingent, led by shows filmed in Louisiana, has been entrenched for years, and Alaska-Yukon shows are almost as numerous. Now the Northeast is making a run; Maine, for instance, has also brought us “Cold River Cash” (about eel fishermen) and “North Woods Law” (about game wardens).  “Down East Dickering,” which had its premiere early this month and is seen on Wednesday nights, is a sort of free ad for a publication full of ads: Uncle Henry’s Weekly Swap or Sell It Guide, in which people list junk that they’re trying to sell, jobs that they’re looking to have done and so on. The focus is on a group of men who apparently do little more than peruse Uncle Henry’s for opportunities from which they can wring a small profit by buying and reselling, or some other form of barter. Your genial guide to this world is a hairy fellow named Tony Bennett — yes, you read that right — who acts as a sort of narrator and explains the finer, if indecipherable, points of dickering with phrases like “The deal isn’t done until it’s done.”  Something about nontraditional economic systems seems to attract oddly named entities. Bitcoin, you’ll recall, was recently tangled up in a mess involving an outfit called Mt. Gox. On “Down East Dickering,” the dickerers include men who go by the names Yummy, Turtle, Codfish and Captain 2-stroke. Watch this show long enough, and you begin to suspect that the dickering world consists of a finite amount of cash and a limitless amount of junk, all of it circulating among various dickerers endlessly, no one ever getting any richer or accomplishing much of consequence. Still, dickering seems to have at least as good a chance as Bitcoin does of leading us to a new economic paradigm. The next time the economy goes sour, a Commerce Department led by Secretary Yummy might be our best chance of straightening things out.",0.14984615384615388,0.013150240962740959

Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection early this year after disclosing that hackers had made off with a half-billion dollars’ worth of the virtual currency, said on Wednesday that it would most likely be liquidated. In a statement on its website, the company said a local court had dismissed its request that it be allowed to try to rehabilitate its business. A court-appointed lawyer will now oversee its assets ahead of any payout to creditors, the statement said. Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, said that drafting a rehabilitation plan had proved “difficult.” When it filed for bankruptcy protection in late February, the exchange said it was unclear what had happened to its users’ Bitcoins, or indeed if its accounting of its currency holdings was accurate. The company later said it had discovered about 200,000 of the virtual coins in an “old-format” wallet that stored the virtual currency offline. Documents leaked last week showed one plan, backed by a group of United States investors, that proposed buying the company for just one Bitcoin, or about $520. The move to liquidate Mt. Gox “will create great inconvenience and concerns to our creditors for which we apologize,” the statement said. Mark Karpeles, the exchange’s chief executive, had “lost his authority” over the company’s assets, it said. Mt. Gox had been a pioneer in the world of virtual currency exchanges, at one point handling about 80 percent of Bitcoin transactions. But last year, it began losing significant ground to more advanced exchanges, like BTC-e in Bulgaria and Bitstamp in Slovenia. Mt. Gox was also plagued by late payments to its users, especially after the authorities seized about $5 million of its funds in the United States in mid-2013, saying it had failed to register as a money-transmitting service. The exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo on Feb. 28, saying it had lost about 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to its customers and more than 100,000 of its own coins — essentially its entire stock, worth almost $500 million. The company faces class-action lawsuits in the United States and Canada from users who claim fraud by the company and by its chief executive.

Sometimes it seems that way.  This famous experiment in virtual cash, with its aura of near anonymity and lack of pesky regulation, gets tech heads really excited. Yet it may be the most famous thing in the world that nobody really understands.  People who hear about it have questions like “What is it?” and “Wait, I still don’t understand. What is it?” and “Why has the price fluctuated so wildly?” And, finally, “Are any of them, maybe, lodged between my sofa cushions?” I can answer only the last question: No, unless you also have a virtual sofa. I was born too late for the tulip bulbs and too early for Beanie Babies, but I don’t want to miss out on Bitcoin mania. Of course, I can’t become a Bitcoin mogul without knowing anything about it, so I did some research.  The first thing I found out? This is the closest thing in finance to riding an angry bull at the rodeo. The value of a single Bitcoin has gone as high as $1,200 and plummeted on bad news for the currency, like theft through hacking, to less than half of that. So caveat investor, says the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. Those spoilsports put out an alert warning investors that it could be “more than a bit risky” to buy and sell Bitcoin because of all that volatility, and that there was a potential for fraud in dealing with some of the companies that say they are involved in the Bitcoin world. Bracing! Wouldn’t you know it? The bureaucrats are circling. The Internal Revenue Service has been looking at Bitcoin too, and with something of a gimlet eye. It recently tried to get a fix on just what Bitcoin is, because commerce is the sort of thing that the I.R.S. likes to get a piece of. On March 25, the friendly fellas at the tax office took a stab at telling us what Bitcoin, and other virtual currency, is. The answer, roughly, is that it’s more like property than currency — and, by the way, you do need to pay taxes on your Bitcoin transactions.  Does that sound like paperwork and trouble? Well, you might say that, and news of the potentially burdensome ruling drove the cost of a Bitcoin to below $500. But many people took the news as a move forward for the legitimacy of the currency, or investment, or whatever the heck it is.  To be fair, something whose value bobs and weaves this way does sound more like an investment than a currency. In fact, it sounds like many investments I’ve made in my proven track record of buying high and selling low. It’s a gift.  Folks like Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, applauded the I.R.S. move, saying it “provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they’re doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing Bitcoin and other digital currencies.” I’M still no expert, but isn’t playing by the rules the opposite of what many people who are interested in Bitcoin want — and, more important, what I want? Don’t I get to fly my pirate flag? If I wanted to play by the rules, wouldn’t I just invest in a money-market fund, with perfect safety and ... sorry, I just fell asleep for a moment.  But that dream state reminds me: As a science-fiction fan, I used to tear through books that predicted a digital-currency future, an anonymous underground economy where value flowed without government buttinskis. It made money seem exciting, not just depressing. And the novels predicted that government, threatened by the crypto-cash revolt, would do anything it could to block that future. Of course, who needs government sabotage when the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange, already seems to be doing a fine job of undermining faith in digital currency? It has out-Finra’d Finra! I called a smart person to help me figure all this out. Ajay Vinze, associate dean at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, has done research on Bitcoin, and he says that if you are going to disrupt the existing way of doing things, “you come across as a pirate.”  He told me that Bitcoin wasn’t yet functioning quite like money because of all the volatility, but that it’s well on its way to the kind of respectability that requires a less swashbuckling demeanor. “Once you’re successful,” he said, “you’re stuck with this nuance of having to put on the cloak of legitimacy.”  As my brain started to melt, I realized that some of the smartest people in the business world completely disagree about Bitcoin. It’s caused something of a billionaire slap fight between Warren Buffett and Marc Andreessen.  Mr. Buffett recently expressed skepticism about the new currency. “It’s a mirage, basically,” he told CNBC on March 14. He added, “The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke, in my view.” Mr. Andreessen, who invented the first popular web browser and became a big tech investor, made it sound as if the Oracle of Omaha had told the whole Internet to get off his lawn. As a champion of new technologies, Mr. Andreessen has ranked Bitcoin’s importance up with that of personal computers and the Internet. His venture capital firm has invested more than $50 million in Bitcoin-related companies. In a Twitter post, he called Mr. Buffett one of the “old white men“ who disparage technologies they don’t understand.  Mr. Andreessen, as it turns out, is also white and also not so young anymore, at least not by wunderkind standards. He backpedaled a bit with a succession of tweets praising Mr. Buffett highly, and offered to spend “as much time with Warren as he wants teaching him all about Bitcoin. :-)”  Mr. Buffett didn’t respond publicly to Mr. Andreessen, or to my request for comment, because he’s Warren Buffett, for crying out loud, and he doesn’t need to mess with this kind of stuff. O.K., two observations here: First, does Mr. Buffett really want to spend a lot of time getting a tutorial from Mr. Andreessen? You can just read the frequently asked questions list at Bitcoin.org, though it’s full of language like “the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms.”  Sorry, I dropped off again ...  But what bothers me is this: When billionaires fight, shouldn’t it be with weaponry more impressive than tweets? Twitter is the battleground for weenies. Billionaires have the money to buy private armies! Of robot warriors! With lasers! On a giant chessboard! That’s the true spirit of virtual currency, isn’t it? Real life is such a disappointment.  I’M hoping for the Bitcoin world to be more fun. So far, though, finding someone who accepts virtual currency isn’t that easy. The site useBitcoins.info lists more than 2,000 businesses that take the currency, or investment, or whatever, all over the world. If I need an electrician in Coventry, England, I’m covered, and I can use Bitcoin to satisfy all of my beef jerky needs at beefjerky.com. Yet trying to handle transactions in my New Jersey neighborhood is a little tougher. I’ve been asking around. There’s apparently a fitness “boot camp” in the town next door that accepts Bitcoin, but I don’t like paying people to sweat when I can sweat just fine for nothing. At my local car-rental counter, the guys look at me as if I were trying to pull a fast one. The checkout machine at Home Depot doesn’t have a button for paying with Bitcoin. And my cats act as if they don’t know what I’m talking about. I guess they aren’t living in the future.",0.11449705882352941,0.10541499023851963

You go to the grocery store, and when you look for the checkout counter there is none. There’s no place to pay for your groceries because you already did. When you walked into the store, a sensor identified you, perhaps from a ring or watch you were wearing that transmitted the information. Or perhaps you didn’t need to wear anything special. Maybe a device in the store figured out who you were using a combination of facial recognition, 3-D body shape identification and your gait. Your unique identifier is attached to your digital wallet, which transmits payment for the groceries directly to the store. But you don’t pay in dollars. Your wallet has a dozen digital currencies in it, all with different values based on a variety of factors, including loyalty programs. At certain stores, you might pay with their version of frequent-flier miles. At others, you might pay with the equivalent of a virtual credit card — except the credit card isn’t issued by a traditional bank. You might also pay with credit that you received through a peer-to-peer online exchange that connects investors with people seeking short- and long-term loans. That’s how you got your mortgage and financed your self-driving car, too. Welcome to the future, courtesy of the minds of some of the sharpest futurists around. The scenes just described may sound as if they came from a futuristic movie or an episode of “The Jetsons.” Yet, that’s just a middle-of-the-road view of the future; it gets wilder from here. If the last three decades revolutionized the information and telecommunications industries, the next three may upend the basic tenets of finance: currency, credit and banks, as well as payment and transmission systems. Your children may even ask you, “What was it like to see that old-fashioned building called a bank?” In recent years, we’ve already begun to see hints of an impending overhaul: the emergence of Bitcoin and the ecosystem growing around it; the adoption of peer-to-peer lending businesses like Lending Club; and the introduction of Square, the payment system, to name just a few. And even if you believe Bitcoin is no more than a fad — and that may well be, given its volatility, security issues and potential regulatory challenges — it has raised the prospect of new virtual currencies and, at the least, cheaper and more efficient transaction mechanisms. “Money is a very interesting philosophical idea in that we have all of humanity agreeing on this system,” said Ray Kurzweil, a futurist, inventor and author. “So even though we may radically disagree on some things — like let’s say the U.S. government and Al Qaeda — they both respect money. So it’s remarkable how we have this universal respect for this very esoteric virtual construct.” Several prominent dreamers, including Marc Andreessen, who led the team that invented the first commercial web browser, say they believe that new virtual currencies will come to dominate the way we pay for things in the future. “Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system,” he wrote recently. Mr. Kurzweil, however, is not so sure how easy it will be for new currencies to emerge. “We’ve built up respect for currencies associated with nations,” he said. “People respect dollars, mostly, I think, because of the track record, relative stability.” Other futurists suggest that there will be dozens of ways to pay for products. “We are going to have individually issued currencies. We already have corporations issuing currency: frequent-flier miles, although people don’t see them as that from a legal perspective,” said Heather Schlegel, a futurist and social scientist who recently started a project called the Future of Money as an online documentary series supported through — what else — Kickstarter, a crowdsourced investment tool. Ms. Schlegel is hoping to explore various new payment methods, transactions and what it all means. Some of her exploration is beyond anything we can comprehend today: She considers, for example, the kind of manipulation of the subconscious that happens in the 2010 movie “Inception” as something that could really happen in the future. For all the promise of new currencies and transaction systems, there is a long trail of failed efforts. In 1998, a virtual currency called Beenz was introduced. Customers earned Beenz when they visited certain websites and shopped at certain online stores. It had the backing of investors like Lawrence Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle. But for all its promise, it went bust by 2001. Flooz was another currency born during the dot-com era that ended as quickly as it arrived, as did Internetcash.com. E-gold, a virtual currency backed by gold, also failed. All of them were plagued by some customers trying to use them for illicit purposes. While the future of currency may be the biggest question mark around finance, shifts in the plumbing of transactions and the future of banks may be the most transformative. What happens when you no longer need a bank to provide capital? Instead, investors and those looking for credit — individuals and businesses — meet online. Is that a real possibility? What are the regulatory ramifications? Are we more interconnected or less? Where will people store money in the future? And will it be safe? These are the questions that fill not only the minds of today’s executives but also the minds of social scientists and investors in Silicon Valley. Of course, while the future may look different, it may turn out to be familiar. “Maybe nothing is going to change, really,” Ms. Schlegel said. “Maybe a lot of these new concepts are going to get rolled into the dollar and the dollar will evolve slightly, because what’s happening is all these new ideas will put pressure on the dollar to kind of be different.”",0.19736595744680854,0.070230266187713

Rather, it may rely on its image. In the last few months, the value of Bitcoin has been cut in half, in the face of questions about security issues and concerns about new regulations. Warren E. Buffett referred to the currency as a “mirage” in an interview last month and told people to “stay away.” Would-be adopters and investors have grown fearful as hackers develop new ways to steal Bitcoin and major Bitcoin exchanges shut down. The Internal Revenue Service has even weighed in on how Bitcoin will be taxed. Proponents have a mounting public relations crisis on their hands, particularly as Bitcoin becomes hackers’ preferred payment method. Hackers have recently taken to mounting large scale denial-of-service attacks on tech start-ups — most recently, Meetup, a social meeting site; Vimeo, the video sharing service; and Basecamp, a project management software company — and demanding payments via Bitcoin as ransom to cease. Even the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit group that was set up to promote Bitcoin’s legitimate use, was marred after one of its board members was arrested and charged with money laundering. In fact, the biggest Bitcoin holder is the United States government, after the F.B.I. seized some 144,000 coins — roughly $66 million at current prices — from Silk Road, the now-defunct digital market that prosecutors say aided drug deals and other illicit transactions. Consumer confidence in and adoption of new technologies — especially regarding money — is highly dependent on security, or at least the public’s perception of security. To that end, Bitcoin enthusiasts, cryptographers and security researchers are putting renewed focus on security and self-policing. They face an uphill battle. While the Bitcoin system itself is protected by strong cryptography, thieves have pilfered hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of coins by exploiting weaknesses in private key storage systems and hundreds of millions more from exchanges. Joe Stewart and Pat Litke, two security researchers at Dell SecureWorks, set out in recent months to evaluate the threats facing Bitcoin. They discovered more than 120 unique families of malware on the Internet that had been specifically engineered to steal Bitcoin wallet files from people’s computers, or to steal coins through other means such as recording a user’s keystrokes so an attacker could grab a user’s private keys as they type them in. The most common strains of malware they discovered were so-called wallet stealers, software specifically designed to search for a user’s Bitcoin wallet on a hard drive or in well-known file locations. The attackers would then upload the information to a remote server, extract the keys and steal coins. Security experts have long advised the use of long, secure passwords, but Mr. Litke and Mr. Stewart found that in some cases, the attackers managed to bypass strong passcodes by using a keylogger, which records passwords when victims type them in, or by monitoring the copy-and-paste clipboard function. When the researchers tested the cryptocurrency malware against popular antivirus systems, they found the average detection rate was an abysmal 48.9 percent. More than half of major antivirus solutions failed to detect attackers’ malicious code. And, unlike cases of credit card fraud, in which credit card companies can reimburse the victims, Bitcoin theft is similar to theft of cash. Once it’s gone, it’s probably gone for good. “It’s incredibly easy for malware to steal Bitcoin, especially if you’re keeping them on the same computer you use to casually browse the Internet,” Mr. Stewart said. “There are so many holes for criminals to walk through.” Mr. Stewart and other security researchers now advise users to keep their Bitcoin in so-called cold storage. The private keys needed to conduct a transaction are stored on a secure offline device, or even printed out, much like storing the bulk of one’s cash in a physical safe. Some of the biggest Bitcoin thefts have occurred at the exchanges. Mt. Gox’s operators say hackers were able to steal more than $450 million worth of Bitcoin using a bug that tricked its system into moving a user’s coins to an attacker’s account, while simultaneously fooling Mt. Gox’s system into thinking the withdrawal did not go through. Mt. Gox would then resend the requested amount, effectively doubling the withdrawal from a user’s account. Mt. Gox asserted that hackers used this bug to make off with 850,000 coins — 750,000 owned by customers and 100,000 owned by Mt. Gox at the time of the announcement. One month later, Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s 28-year-old chief executive, said the company had found 200,000 coins in an old wallet. But last week, two Swiss researchers compared Mt. Gox’s assertions with what they had witnessed across Bitcoin’s distributed network. By creating specialized nodes that could trace and dump all transactions across the Bitcoin network, they found that only 386 coins could have been successfully stolen from the Bitcoin network using the bug Mt. Gox cited. Their conclusion: Some 650,000 coins were unaccounted for. Representatives for Mt. Gox did not return requests for comment. But after Mt. Gox was shut down in late February, other prominent exchanges were suddenly attacked. Flexcoin said it was hacked on March 2, forcing it to shut down. On March 5, Crypto-Trade also said it was attacked, but recently said it had resumed allowing Bitcoin withdrawals. To avoid similar fates, Bitcoin proponents, researchers and exchanges have started new systems and self-regulations to help instill confidence among adopters and bring Bitcoin into mainstream use. Two programmers from the Czech Republic, Marek Palatinus and Pavol Ruznak, created the Trezor Wallet after Mr. Palatinus lost more than 3,000 coins to cyberthieves. The wallet, a hardware device that cannot be infected by malware, makes cold storage more practical. A new Bitcoin vault service, Xapo, is promising to insure deposits from any losses to hacker attacks, theft by a Xapo employee, break-ins at its vault or any bankruptcy. Elsewhere, exchanges are working to improve “transaction integrity verification,” or the system by which transactions can be tied back to identities. An initiative called the Bison Network — or the Bitcoin Identity Security Open Network — is working with Jumio, a four-year-old credential management company backed by Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, to validate buyer’s identities using Jumio’s software. And after the I.R.S. announced last week that Bitcoin would be considered property and taxed as such, media reports pointed out that those living in the United States would have to begin the onerous task of tracking their Bitcoin purchases, or risk submitting fraudulent tax returns. Customers of Overstock, for example, may need accountants to figure out capital gains taxes on all the ups and downs of their Bitcoin holdings if they use the virtual currency every time they buy furniture on the site. The worry, many say, is that mounting security and a proliferation of rules could mean death by a thousand cuts. Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal, the digital payment system that itself was the target for hackers before it achieved acceptance, said in an interview this week that Bitcoin’s fate would ultimately be dictated by whether users could find the right balance between security and convenience. “What is slowing down adoption is that Bitcoin can be hard to understand and hard to use,” Mr. Levchin said. “It has to get really simple. For that simplicity to really happen, most often it necessarily has to become less secure to become more convenient.” “But at PayPal,” Mr. Levchin added. “I’d like to claim we found the intersection. So I know it’s doable.”",-0.004931944444444444,0.06028906709288654
213,Essay: The Real Competition to Virtual Currency,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/essay-the-real-competition-to-virtual-currency/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-04-01T18:23:53+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"BITCOIN enthusiasts may want to study a satirical etching, published in 1792, that is now in a collection at London’s National Portrait Gallery. In one half, titled “French Liberty,” an emaciated French revolutionary gnaws on raw onions. In the other, “British Slavery,” a corpulent Englishman feasts on a giant slab of meat. The etching’s message — that a revolution is a farce if it fails to provide the basics — hangs uneasily over the world of virtual currencies. For Bitcoin or its peers to emerge from their niche, they have to one day provide all the crucial benefits that come with the current system of money. For now, people are forgiving of currency innovations. No one expects fledgling digital money to quickly be the equal of the status quo — a system that has come into existence over centuries. Still, it is not clear that virtual currencies will ever have the strengths and scope of the current system, which, let’s face it, functions nearly all of the time. One big reason we have not had revolutionary forms of new money in recent times is that the current system more or less works. That was even hinted at in the seminal 2008 paper about Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, the real or made-up name of the currency’s creator or creators. “While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model,” the paper says. Anyone struggling to understand why digital currencies are not widely used ought to look at consumer behavior. Consumers have no problem rapidly adopting new technologies if they find them attractive. But they get a lot out of the current system. With minimal inconvenience, they can make secure noncash payments online and in stores, and they can do so around the world at any time. The existing system also allows people to store their money safely in insured banks, and those banks have the ability to create new money out of thin air when they lend to other consumers. The virtual currencies are nowhere near achieving those things, and more to the point, they often do not want to. “As a consumer, not only am I using a real currency, I also have access to credit and access to a secure bank,” said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard. Over the last 30 years, the banking and payments system has not remained static. Credit and debit cards are now widely used, as are A.T.M.s and Internet banking. And the creativity continues as the widespread adoption of mobile phones has spawned easier ways to pay for things and do basic banking. In mid-April, Samsung is expected to release a phone that will allow users to buy items with a PayPal app, using only a finger swipe to verify the transaction. “You can look forward to a world where we don’t have user names and passwords,” Hill Ferguson, chief product officer for PayPal, said. Virtual currencies are not close to offering such convenience and security on a broad scale. And it may be that the very stability of the current system is what provides the platform for inventing new products. “Innovation happens so much faster when it happens on a strong foundation,” Mr. McLaughlin said. Consumers did not seem to be uppermost in the minds of Bitcoin’s creators. Instead, they seemed motivated mostly by a desire to reduce the cost of a payments system. Such savings would most likely benefit merchants far more than consumers. And it is not necessarily the case that virtual currencies, if they ever gain broad acceptance, will ultimately be that much cheaper. One way Bitcoin tries to keep its costs down is by using its own self-reinforced method of transaction verification. The 2008 Nakamoto paper lays out an elegant mechanism by which a potential attacker of the system would instead be induced to protect the system. “He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favor him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth,” the paper contends. But that mechanism may not be enough to reach the broader security of existing currencies. In recent weeks, large amounts of Bitcoin have apparently gone missing. And even if a virtual currency proves over time that its own system is secure, governments may demand wider types of compliance — to prevent abuses like money-laundering and fraud — that push up the costs of using it. “There are real costs that go along with managing those risks,” said Jim McCarthy, global head of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa. Many supporters of virtual currencies would naturally resist government interference in their systems. At the same time, the authorities may feel uncomfortable allowing too many transactions in them, especially if they are hard to monitor. In contrast, one of the advantages of the existing system is that it has long operated within the confines of society. The dollar is embedded in America’s democracy. That gives voters some say over the government entities that back, spend and print the nation’s currency. Law enforcement knows it well and is able to demand that banks provide information on potential criminal activities. One of the most persuasive arguments for new currencies is that over the years, governments have had a tendency to debase and mishandle existing currencies, leading to financial instability and inflation. Some libertarians support virtual currencies because they stand apart from government interference, like a digital gold standard. But again, such aspirations show little concern for the needs of ordinary people. The current system was, after all, able to right itself after it nearly failed in 2008. The authorities prevented a grim spiral that could have pushed unemployment even higher than it was after the crisis. The efforts that brought the system back from the brink, including printing money and shoring up the banks, were made possible by the dollar’s inherent flexibility and its roots in America’s democracy. Virtual currencies may never have the ability to bend during times of emergency, and that may be their undoing or, at least, the reason they do not go far. The status quo is, of course, imperfect in many ways. There is a chance that some aspects of virtual currencies will be adopted by the current system, making it stronger. But as things stand today, digital money is highly unlikely to become the new status quo. Anyone hoping to feast on Bitcoin may not get anything more than raw onions.",0.07969454545454545,0.06993483494619858
214,Consumers Are Still Seeing Seams in the Mobile Wallet,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/consumers-are-still-seeing-seams-in-the-mobile-wallet/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-04-01T14:22:35+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"LIBBY CATHEY and her sorority sisters fumbled with pesos as they split the bill at Señor Frog’s in Cancún, Mexico, over spring break last month. But the return trip was painless. For the cab ride from the airport to New York University, two of her sorority sisters took out their smartphones and, with a few taps, reimbursed her for their portions of the fare in a few seconds. This, according to a cadre of start-ups and big corporations, is how consumers will pay for everything in the future, from babysitters to four-star dinners, as checks become cumbersome and exact change harder to find. New payment apps are trying to replace your physical wallet with a seamless, Internet-connected experience known as the mobile wallet. But these technologies — from giants like PayPal, Google and Chase as well as upstarts like Venmo and Square — are still in their early stages, and as they vie for attention and users, many consumers are failing to see the point, according to a report released in late March by the Federal Reserve. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” said Ginger Schmeltzer, the senior vice president for emerging payments at Fiserv, a financial services technology company. “Until there are consumers demanding to use whatever the payment option is on their mobile devices, or until there is a compelling cost saving or revenue increase that businesses feel comfortable about, the real turning point in mobile payments is not going to happen.” The Fed found that 17 percent of smartphone owners used their devices at least once to make a payment in a store last year, compared with 6 percent of smartphone owners in 2012. Those like Ms. Cathey who used their devices to transfer money to other people’s accounts made up 15 percent of smartphone owners last year, the Fed reported. (A little more than half of the adults in the United States own smartphones, according to a survey last June by the Pew Research Center.) Many of the money transfer services (or peer-to-peer payment services, as the industry calls them) do not release data about their regularly active users. PayPal, for one, says that more than two million people around the world made peer-to-peer transactions on a monthly basis last year. But the numbers in the Fed survey, which include people who have tried the services just once or twice, point to the hurdles facing the mobile wallet on its quest for widespread use. Such services do have their converts. Ms. Cathey, 20, a junior at N.Y.U. and the president of the university’s chapter of Delta Phi Epsilon, uses “Venmo” as a verb. She and her sorority sisters rely on the app to pool money for events. After entering their debit card and bank account information, users of Venmo can easily send money to others in their network. The service, which includes a social element, “made money matters not so awkward anymore,” Ms. Cathey said. College students are often early adopters of technologies that become widely popular, as Facebook demonstrated. Venmo appears to be a favorite at N.Y.U., where members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity use it to pay dues. Another start-up, Clinkle, is aiming to appeal to college students, though it has yet to widely release an app and had a couple of high-level staff departures in March. Although Silicon Valley has bet hundreds of millions of dollars in the last few years that the mobile wallet will go mainstream, many of these services are still in early stages. One service, Square Cash, does not collect any revenue. Venmo, a five-year-old start-up based in Manhattan, also earns no revenue when users pay their friends. Venmo did buy itself some time to develop new products and gain users: It became part of eBay last year when PayPal, an eBay subsidiary, bought its parent company, Braintree. (Venmo’s cryptic ads featuring an unsmiling man named Lucas began appearing on the New York subway late last year.) Another obstacle for Venmo and similar apps is that all parties to a transaction need to be willing to use the service. Digitally splitting a bill at a restaurant, for instance, might seem easy, but this use is “still very much in its infancy, and very small,” said Ron Shevlin, a retail banking analyst at the Aite Group, a research firm. The other major use of the mobile wallet — making payments in stores, often by tapping or scanning a smartphone near the register — has been slow to catch on. But proponents of these services say they appeal to shoppers and businesses because they may incorporate loyalty programs and can reduce the time it takes to pay. The widely acknowledged leader in adopting this technology is Starbucks, which says that 14 percent of all transactions in its stores are conducted through mobile devices. Starbucks, which has a close partnership with Square, the payment start-up run by Jack Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter, says that paying with a smartphone is simply more convenient. “You’re more likely to have your phone in your hand when you’re in line at Starbucks than you are to have your credit card in your hand,” said Adam Brotman, the company’s chief digital officer. “So it’s actually more convenient to use your phone.” This reasoning fails to impress Andrew Kortina, the co-founder of Venmo, who says that mobile payments in stores will not catch on unless they offer something that traditional cash or credit card payments don’t. That could mean, say, allowing shoppers to skip the checkout line and walk out with an item with a few taps on their phone, as is already possible in Apple stores. Or perhaps automatically delivering items to a shopper’s home. (Starbucks says it plans to introduce a way for customers to order ahead with their smartphones and pick up their coffee in stores.) “Thinking about replacing a cash register with something else is the wrong framework,” Mr. Kortina said. “There’s just so much more you could do with a phone.” One evangelist of the mobile wallet, Carey Kolaja, the vice president for global product solutions at PayPal, said she tried to go as long as possible without using cash. During a recent trip to São Paulo, Brazil, with her team, she said, she lasted the entire week without using any reais, the Brazilian currency, though she did often resort to her credit card. A place that regularly stymies her goal? The nail salon. Still, the technology has not made inroads with everyone. Ben Miller, 39, an assistant professor of English and communication at Georgia State University, who was visiting a Starbucks at N.Y.U. on a recent Friday, said he saw no need to pay with his phone. “You have to carry a backup credit card anyway, so it becomes a redundant option,” he said. Paying with a smartphone in stores “has been the next big thing for many, many rounds of next big things,” said James Wester, a research director at IDC, a technology advisory firm. “We assumed we’d be further along by now,” he added. “We’re now just at the end of the beginning.”",0.125396,0.03077173701298701
215,"Amid Bitcoin Uncertainty, ‘the Smart Money Knows That Crypto Is Not Ready’",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/technology/cryptocurrency-bust-wall-street.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-04-02,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Paul Chou was among the many Bitcoin aficionados who thought big Wall Street institutions were about to become heavy hitters in the cryptocurrency markets. Mr. Chou came from one of those institutions, Goldman Sachs, and created a cryptocurrency exchange, LedgerX, that would cater to big investors with sophisticated financial contracts. Now, in the wake of last year’s Bitcoin crash, Mr. Chou is being forced to confront how few of the big finance companies acted on their cryptocurrency plans. “It was definitely part of the original plan that institutions would be a big part of this market,” he said. “We were wrong.” Goldman Sachs said it was opening a Bitcoin trading operation to serve clients. A year later, customer interest has been weak, and the bank has not received regulatory approval to buy and hold actual Bitcoins for customers, according to a person familiar with the operation, who was not authorized to comment on it publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been forced to delay the opening of the cryptocurrency exchange it announced last year, and there is still no clear sign of when it will get the approval needed from regulators. The exchange declined to comment. And the Chicago Board Options Exchange said last month that it was going to stop offering a Bitcoin trading contract that it started with great fanfare in late 2017. The faltering efforts among big financial outfits are part of a retrenchment in the cryptocurrency industry after last year’s bust, when the price of a single Bitcoin fell from nearly $20,000 to around $4,000. It has lingered there for months, but had an unexpected jolt on Tuesday, briefly exceeding $5,000. Some cryptocurrency enthusiasts had hoped that the entrance of Wall Street institutions would give them legitimacy with traditional investors. But their struggles — and waning interest — illustrate the difficulty in bringing Bitcoin from the fringes of the internet into the mainstream financial world. “The smart money knows that crypto is not ready,” said Ciaran Murray, a cryptocurrency trader in London. Mr. Murray tried to set up a hedge fund focused on digital tokens, but he found that when investors dug into the technology they were turned off. “Once you get into the details, it scared them off,” he said. Mr. Murray and other cryptocurrency believers are adamant that the problems are not a death blow for Bitcoin and the technology it introduced. Mr. Chou, for example, is retooling LedgerX and applying for regulatory approval to open trading to small retail investors, whose interest in cryptocurrencies has held up a bit more. And the big companies haven’t entirely walked away. Goldman and the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, are moving ahead with their cryptocurrency trading operations despite tepid interest from customers. The giant asset manager Fidelity recently began working with a small number of big clients that want to hold cryptocurrencies. In Silicon Valley, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and the online payments company Square, announced last month that he was looking to hire three or four Bitcoin developers. He compared the technology to the early internet, both in its problems and its potential. Even in this “crypto winter,” as some are calling it, the depressed price of Bitcoin is still four times higher than it was at a peak in 2013, before an earlier crash. But few of the more practical ambitions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been realized, and it can still be hard to determine what is real and what is not real around digital tokens. An American company looking to set up Bitcoin investment funds, Bitwise Asset Management, recently said it had determined that 95 percent of the trading activity reported by Bitcoin exchanges around the world was fake. The structure of Bitcoin makes it hard to maintain control. All Bitcoins are accounted for on a decentralized ledger, known as the blockchain, which no single institution controls. Anyone can have access to it, giving free rein to bad actors. Regulators have not approved investment products tied to Bitcoin because of the likelihood that prices are being manipulated. But exchanges where investors can bet on the price movement of Bitcoin through futures contracts, without having to hold Bitcoins, have gained approval. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or C.M.E. has introduced a Bitcoin futures contract that has gained moderate traction with traders. Still, the market has been small enough that the C.M.E.’s competitor, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said recently that it would stop issuing its own Bitcoin futures contract. Many market watchers have said that for Bitcoin to gain deeper traction with big investors, those investors will have to be able to buy and hold actual Bitcoins. Intercontinental Exchange had initially said it hoped to open up its cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, last fall, with the ability for investors to end up holding the Bitcoins they bought. Goldman Sachs also said last year that it was hoping to allow its customers to buy and hold Bitcoins. The Bakkt and Goldman Sachs efforts are still in limbo because of questions from regulators about how the institutions would hold Bitcoins for clients. Bakkt and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the delays. Bakkt’s difficulties were recently detailed in The Wall Street Journal. For most traditional investments, like stocks or bonds, there are clearly established methods for securing customer accounts. But the design of Bitcoin means that if a Bitcoin is stolen from a Bitcoin wallet, where the digital tokens are stored, it is hard to get back. This has already been a big problem for many Bitcoin exchanges that have suffered crippling thefts and losses. “There is a lot of new ground being covered, and the regulators’ job is to be satisfied, not just to be fast,” said Thomas Chippas, the chief executive of another exchange hoping to cater to big investors, ErisX, which has also been held up by the regulators. Even if the authorities are able to get comfortable with the security arrangements at Bitcoin exchanges, there is the question of what application Bitcoin and other digital tokens might have outside of speculation. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts have argued that the original cryptocurrency is useful as a place to store value outside the control of any government or institution, as if it were a digital version of gold. But that narrative has been tested as the value of Bitcoin has bounced around. And other applications for Bitcoin, like using it to pay for things online, have not taken off. “I think it will be years and years before it will be ready for nonspeculative use cases,” Mr. Murray said. “Until now, it’s just been people buying it and hoping it’s going to go up. I think that’s not going to end for three or four years.”",0.08929649122807018,0.025617199564567983

To pay for servers and domain names, they turned to Bitcoin, a digital currency that allows for secure payments without banks, government authorization or verified identities. Yet what makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to criminals also limits their usefulness to them. Bitcoin transaction records helped investigators find the Russian agents under indictment. To cover their tracks, the perpetrators of the hacking scheme would have been better off using briefcases full of cash. The details of this case are an encouraging sign. Cryptocurrencies are part of a global experiment in making money — the secure exchange of value — as decentralized as information on the internet. Just as anyone can put up a blog without going through traditional media, cryptocurrencies can remove control from financial intermediaries. And like the internet, cryptocurrencies are not inherently a force for lawlessness. Nor is their legitimacy guaranteed. Governments and the private sector must make existing gateways between cryptocurrency and the traditional financial world, such as Bitcoin exchanges, more transparent. And they must adopt mechanisms to limit illegal activity, fraud and regulatory evasion, while preserving the freedom to innovate. Ironically, Bitcoin’s success depends on the same critical factor as a state-issued “fiat” currency: the collective trust of its community of users. Their confidence in the accuracy of the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions is what makes the currency viable. Law-abiding citizens want efficient, reliable payments. Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, realized this. His 2008 white paper said a great deal about cutting out banks; it said nothing about evading the rule of law. Cryptocurrencies make transactions trustworthy without relying on private intermediaries or central banks. Banks know your public identity, but they keep transaction specifics secret. Bitcoin does the opposite. Identities are represented with private, seemingly arbitrary strings of letters and numbers known as cryptographic keys. Transactions, however, are public. Anyone can see how the money flows. That’s necessary for Bitcoin’s security model, which relies on a public network of computers collectively validating transactions. The problem for criminals is that it’s possible to reconstruct Bitcoin identities from transaction patterns. The currency moves through gateways, exchanges and wallet systems, which makes it easier for people to acquire, store and use cryptocurrency in a world that still speaks dollars and euros. However, these systems are usually centralized, so they can be traced, and their administrators can be asked to cooperate with law enforcement. That is likely what happened in the Russian hacking case. That is also what helped lead to the takedown in 2013 of Silk Road, a widely used online marketplace for drug transactions and other illegal purchases. BTC-E, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange, later became the platform of choice for criminals because it did not collect identification documents from its customers. BTC-E was shut down by American law enforcement agencies last year. As these examples show, governments have more leverage over cryptocurrency markets than one might expect. In 2013, the Treasury Department issued guidelines requiring exchanges to verify customer identities. As a result, the volume of cryptocurrency obtained from illegal activity and laundered through Europe between 2013 and 2016 was five times as much as the amount that went through North America, according to a study published in January by the analytics firm Elliptic and the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance. Similar requirements will take effect in Europe next year. There are ways to make cryptocurrency activity harder for law enforcement to track. But hiding transactions adds cost and complexity. More important, decentralized cryptocurrency networks still require trust in the software developers, transaction validators and other support organizations that work with them. These partners have to be responsible if they want to support large markets. To be sure, there is still substantial illegal activity involving cryptocurrencies. Much of it, though, involves thefts and swindles from legitimate cryptocurrency users. Unless law enforcement and regulation weed out these bad actors, cryptocurrencies will not become mainstream. The miracle of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they can create trustworthy transactions in the absence of financial institutions and processes that the world has relied on for centuries. Bitcoin took hold, in part, because the 2008 financial crisis shook so many people’s faith in the status quo. Trust, however, is a fickle thing. Both cryptocurrency proponents and governments must sustain it to create a viable environment for the money of the future.",0.10537173913043478,0.008810674028065336

A bulky blue machine in the lobby of the gun store in Austin, Tex., is one of the first in the country to allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash. “I drove about 20 miles to come use the A.T.M.,” said Mitch Frink, who took $160 out of the machine in its first week in operation. “I wanted to be able say, ‘Yeah, I sold Bitcoin for straight cash and could get it within 30 minutes.’” The machine, built by the Las Vegas company Robocoin, is a somewhat odd creation. If Bitcoin is aimed at moving the world toward a cashless future, how long will a cash-dispensing machine for the virtual currency last, particularly when it is more awkward to use than a traditional bank A.T.M.? Just to create an account, Robocoin users have to provide state-issued identification and a palm scan. But Robocoin’s growth is recognition that, at least for the foreseeable future, even virtual currency users are going to occasionally need cold, hard cash to live in the real world. At the same time, the difficulty of turning cash into Bitcoin online has created demand for easier ways to buy virtual currencies. The allure of providing this service has drawn in several companies hoping to build a machine that will make Bitcoin available to people on the street. The most successful newcomer so far is Lamassu, run by two brothers in New Hampshire who designed a sleek, stripped-down machine. Because it takes cash for Bitcoin but does not dispense cash, it has fewer security features, making it simpler to use and cheaper to install. The machines, which cost about $5,000, have been shipped to more than 80 places around the world. Lamassu’s goal is to make it as easy to buy Bitcoin as it is to buy a soda from a vending machine. All users have to do is scan the QR code — a two-dimensional type of bar code — for an existing Bitcoin wallet and insert cash. No contact is necessary with Bitcoin exchanges, which often have long account verification processes and expensive money transfer requirements. Most of Lamassu’s competitors are aiming to allow users to also turn existing Bitcoin holdings into cash. A Canadian company, Bit Access, has been shipping units around the world, and Genesis Coin, a San Diego company, is introducing its first machine, the Genesis1, which it is selling for around $15,000. The Robocoin units, which are specially manufactured in Arizona, cost $20,000, but the company managed to introduce its devices before almost anyone else. The first Robocoin machine went into a coffee house in Vancouver last October. The next machines were introduced in Austin during the South by Southwest Interactive festival in March. The four units in Austin are operated by local companies that bought them from Robocoin and are responsible for keeping them stocked with cash and compliant with regulations. “This is like going on an exchange, but with cash, in person,” said Nick Morphis, a co-founder of CoinVault, which operates two of the machines. The process of getting cash out of the machine is somewhat complicated, even if a customer already has a Bitcoin wallet. Users first sign up for a Robocoin account by providing a phone number, a palm print and a state ID, which is scanned in. These measures keep the transactions in compliance with money-laundering regulations. After an account is set up and cash is requested, customers must wait at least 10 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed by the Bitcoin network. When the confirmation comes through, the customer receives a notification by phone and can return to the machine to pick up the cash. To pay for the service, the A.T.M. operator charges 5 percent of each transaction. After using the Robocoin unit at Central Texas Gun Works, Mr. Frink said, “It’s definitely not as quick as going to my Bank of America A.T.M. and getting cash out.” But, he added, “Bitcoin is still in its infancy.”",0.09775161290322579,0.08843969650421264
218,Starting an Overdue Conversation About Money,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/starting-a-overdue-conversation-about-money/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-31T21:48:26+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"THERE is no end to the disagreements about the importance and usefulness of the upstart virtual currency Bitcoin. There is, though, no disagreement that Bitcoin’s rise to a billion-dollar market has helped fuel a wide-ranging conversation on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley — and many places in between — about the nature of money and how it might be evolving. There have been few big changes in the infrastructure of the world’s payment networks in decades. The basic elements of the credit card system have been around since the 1960s, and the mechanisms for bank transfers have been pretty much the same since the 1970s.  Cash looks little different from the way it did in the 18th century. Bitcoin is but an example of several recent technologies that are seeking to upend the way banks, regulators, merchants and consumers think about dealing in money. Creators of mobile wallets and digital tokens, such as Venmo and Square, are trying to provide faster, more seamless ways of paying bills. But few of these other new technologies are trying to change as many elements of the financial system as Bitcoin.  “The awareness of how we spend our money, and how it flows through the pipes, has totally been elevated as a result of Bitcoin,” said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University who has been one of the harshest critics of the virtual currency system. Perhaps the biggest challenge that virtual currencies present to the existing financial system is the speed and ease with which they can move across boundaries of all sorts.  Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top financial regulator, who is scrutinizing the virtual currency sector, has complained in recent appearances about the time it takes for his bank to move money from his own account to pay off a credit card issued by the same bank. In the Bitcoin universe, by contrast, most transactions are confirmed and completed within 10 minutes. The current financial plumbing is a particular concern for people in countries with less-developed financial institutions, and for immigrants trying to send money over international borders. While Western Union can charge a 10 percent fee to move money to Mexico or China, Bitcoin users can make transfers free if they know what they are doing. “There is something very powerful there in terms of allowing these kinds of international transactions with a lot less frictions and lot less cost,” Mr. Lawsky said in a recent interview. Frustration with fees of all sorts has helped drive the interest in virtual currencies. Credit cards, for instance, generally charge merchants 2 to 3 percent of every purchase. Because Bitcoin is run by a decentralized network of computers, rather than a central company, there is essentially no charge to move money from one wallet to another. Start-ups like BitPay that handle the process for merchants currently charge around 1 percent. A Goldman Sachs analyst estimated in a March report that retailers could save $155 billion a year if they all moved to accepting only Bitcoin at current rates. Credit card fees are a particular problem for companies looking to collect small online payments for goods and services that cost less than a dollar — the penny candy purchases of the Internet world. A number of video game companies, including Zynga and Big Fish, have recently decided to take virtual currencies because tiny payments can be made without most of the money going to fees. Even with these advantages, though, virtual currencies have real obstacles to overcome before they become as commonplace as cash. The most frequently discussed shortcoming is their price volatility. If the price of a Bitcoin could fall 10 or even 20 percent in a day — as it has many times — why would a merchant want to take the risk of accepting it? What’s more, the lower costs of Bitcoin transactions are at least partly a result of the fact that Bitcoin companies face fewer regulations. That is changing as regulators like Mr. Lawsky look at creating rules for the industry. He held a hearing in January and is accepting applications for licenses from Bitcoin exchanges. If government authorities do create more rules for these companies, the costs may rise. And if regulators do not move in, the Bitcoin network could remain vulnerable to the hackers and fraudsters who have scared so many consumers away. But while certain types of security flaws have been a major drawback of Bitcoin, the security of the Bitcoin network has also been a major selling point. Recent revelations about the National Security Agency’s classified collection of digital data — and the theft of credit card numbers from retailers like Target — have given ammunition to privacy advocates who think that virtual currencies can provide a more secure and private way to move money. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a common ledger, which makes all transfers traceable. But people who want to keep their Bitcoin spending private are usually able to keep their virtual currency addresses secret. Beyond the practical concerns that Bitcoin is taking on, the virtual currency is helping to fuel broad debates about the way the world’s central banks currently create and manage money. Many Bitcoin advocates are fierce critics of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to help the economic recovery by injecting new money into the financial system, in what is known as quantitative easing The anonymous creator of Bitcoin determined in the software that was released in 2009 that no more than 21 million coins would ever be created, hoping to stave off the inflation that has been a regular feature of the dollar. Fears that the Fed’s recent policies would fuel inflation have not been borne out. In fact, many economists think the bigger threat to the economy is deflation. This has not cooled the ardor of Bitcoin aficionados, who are convinced that the world needs to move away from centralized control of the monetary system. For those who are not fans, the presence of Bitcoin has, if nothing else, held a flashlight to the financial plumbing that used to be all but invisible.",0.11073095238095242,0.06672090806019378

Steven Englander, the chief foreign exchange strategist for Citigroup,  sees the I.R.S. decision as ending “a couple of Bitcoin mythologies”  and possibly nudging  virtual currencies toward becoming mainstream payment systems. In a note sent out on Thursday night, Mr. Englander  said that the belief that one can operate outside the financial system and conduct transactions of any significant size anonymously has been shattered. He also pointed to “a real fork in the road between the Bitcoin as an asset and Bitcoin as a transactions medium.” Many consumers and retailers may use the generic Bitcoin transactions technology, saving on the transactions charge from conventional credit card and money transfer companies, but avoiding the I.R.S. reporting burden. So they will want to transact in Bitcoin, but not hold it, and they will be pretty much indifferent which [digital currency] they use. Exposure will be infinitesimally short. Mr. Englander argues that it is difficult to see how Bitcoin itself can have value “when consumers and businesses actually seek to avoid holding it as an asset.” We come back to the view that if Bitcoin will evolve into a payments technology, it will be simpler to have $coin and €coin which will suffice for almost all transactions. In the same way that the exposure to Bitcoin can be made infinitesimally small in transactions, FX exposure can be made similarly small in cross-border transactions.",-0.05470833333333334,0.03452380952380953

The I.R.S. on Tuesday released guidance indicating that Bitcoins and other so-called virtual currencies that do not have the status of legal tender in any jurisdiction would be treated as property, not currency, for tax purposes. The guidance also indicates that Bitcoin transactions are subject to the same information reporting and withholding requirements as similar transactions in dollars. There were “no real surprises” in the guidance, according to Omri Marian, a University of Florida law professor who has written about the potential for Bitcoin to be used to evade taxes. The I.R.S. guidance follows similar action by taxation authorities in Japan, Canada and Australia. Until Tuesday, Bitcoin users have been forced to speculate about the proper tax treatment of actions such as mining Bitcoins, performing services in exchange for Bitcoins, or buying and selling items denominated in Bitcoins.  While most tax experts agreed that such transactions were taxable, it was unclear if the Bitcoins themselves, once acquired, were capital assets. The I.R.S. guidance, Notice 2014-21, sensibly takes the position that Bitcoin is property, not currency, for tax purposes. Investors who buy Bitcoins can treat those Bitcoins as capital assets, potentially qualifying for the lower tax rate applicable to certain capital gains.  Gains or losses in foreign currency transactions generally give rise to ordinary income or loss under section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Neither the tax code nor the I.R.S. guidance defines the term “currency,” although one can perhaps infer its meaning to be fiat currency accepted as legal tender in a country or jurisdiction. Transactions in foreign currency normally generate ordinary income or loss, not capital gains or losses. For instance, if you buy euros today for $100 and sell them a year from now for $120, you have $20 of ordinary income, even if you were holding the euros for investment purposes. The guidance is important to prevent whipsaw. In the absence of guidance, taxpayers holding Bitcoins for investment purposes might report capital gains if they appreciate, but ordinary losses if they depreciate. The I.R.S. guidance requires taxpayers to use one method or the other, depending on their trade or business.   A few opportunities for gamesmanship remain. Determining the value of a Bitcoin is more subjective than determining the value of a foreign currency. Taxpayers are supposed to convert the value of Bitcoin into dollars by looking up the exchange rate at the time of their transactions.  But the Bitcoin market is not as stable and efficient as the market for foreign currencies. Different online exchanges list different prices. While the I.R.S. says that Bitcoin users are expected to make conversion calculations in a “reasonable manner that is consistently applied,” aggressive taxpayers might shade values in their favor for tax purposes.  From a business perspective, the most important aspect of the guidance may be buried in the plumbing. Payments made using virtual currency are now clearly subject to the same information and backup withholding requirements as other property transactions.  Suppose you are self-employed, and you hire a virtual assistant in the Philippines to help manage your administrative tasks, and that person accepts payment in Bitcoin. Under the I.R.S. guidance, you have to obtain a taxpayer identification number from the assistant, just as if you were paying the person in dollars.  To the extent that Bitcoin’s success depends on anonymity and on avoiding the burden of government regulation, this I.R.S. guidance is an unwelcome blow. Bitcoin users are not accustomed to telling their counterparties who they are, let alone what their Social Security number is.  While some people may choose to ignore the I.R.S. guidance, more established digital economy merchants (like Etsy and eBay vendors) and settlement systems (like PayPal) will tend to comply.  Bitcoin cannot thrive in the underground economy alone, and unless its users pay taxes like other grown-ups, the I.R.S. guidance virtually ensures that it will be a passing fad.

One start-up, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to push Bitcoin into mainstream commerce. On Wednesday, Circle Internet announced the debut – in limited release – of its inaugural payments product, which it hopes will catch on among Bitcoin fans and others who are curious about the much-hyped currency. Jeremy Allaire, the founder and chief executive, said he was trying to move beyond the perception that Bitcoin was a tool merely for “alpha male geeks.” “We’re trying to create a metaphor which relates to how people think about their money,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview. The product, he said, is a “really efficient, instantaneous and secure way to send and spend and receive money.” At the same time, Circle Internet Financial announced that it had raised $17 million in fresh capital. Its existing backers, including the technology investor Jim Breyer and the venture capital firm Accel Partners, where Mr. Breyer is a partner, participated in the financing round. Barry Silbert, the founder of SecondMarket, also invested, through his Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. The new money comes on the heels of a $9 million financing round that the company raised in October.  Since then, Mr. Allaire said, he has been contacted by investors trying to get a piece of the company. While he claimed he did not need to raise more money, he said it “allows us to have a deeper balance sheet as we go into the commercial launch phase of the business.” The product, as described by Mr. Allaire, allows consumers to deposit dollars into an account, which converts the money into Bitcoin and stores it remotely. Users can create an account online and access their digital assets through a mobile app. They also have the ability to spend their Bitcoin at certain retailers that accept the digital currency. On a basic level, the payments system allows people to buy Bitcoin and watch its value go up or down in the account. But Mr. Allaire said the product is aimed at more than simply speculative investing. He is among a number of Bitcoin evangelists who are hoping that financial institutions, whether upstart firms or established players, step in to help create markets in Bitcoin, smoothing out its volatility. If the currency becomes more stable, he says, many more people will be willing to use it. The stakes were raised after the collapse last month of Mt. Gox, a leading Bitcoin exchange. Some Bitcoin fans characterized the exchange’s demise as healthy for the currency, as other platforms would take its place. Mr. Silbert, for one, is developing a new Bitcoin exchange, and Mr. Allaire said there were more in the works. “There are, to my knowledge, another three or four credible, institutionally focused exchange platforms that are raising venture capital and planning to launch in New York this year,” Mr. Allaire said. His start-up, which is based in Boston, continues to attract prominent names. Leonard H. Schrank, a former chief executive of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, an industry-owned financial messaging system based in Brussels, participated in the latest financing round. Fenway Summer, a venture capital firm led by Raj Date, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is also on the board of Circle Internet Financial, also invested. The round included a new investor, the venture capital firm Oak Investment Partners. Mr. Breyer, of Accel Partners, made his investment through his personal firm, Breyer Capital. “The global transformation in payments made possible by Bitcoin and digital currency,” Mr. Breyer said in a statement, “is one of the most significant investment opportunities in the past 30 years.”",0.1737842105263158,0.0556873243715349

Gox, the Bitcoin exchange based here that filed for bankruptcy protection last month, said on Wednesday that it had asked the Japanese police for advice on Bitcoins worth half a billion dollars that the company claims were stolen by hackers. It remains unclear, however, whether the Tokyo Metropolitan Police will start a formal investigation into the purported heist. Very few of the investors who were left in the lurch when Mt. Gox shut down last month are Japanese, and the government has signaled that it intends to take a hands-off approach to regulating the virtual currency. Some Mt. Gox investors, meanwhile, have claimed that there was fraud at the exchange. Mt. Gox said in a statement on its website that it had discussed the situation with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, and handed over electronic records and other materials the exchange “thought would be necessary” for an investigation into the missing virtual currency. An official with the Tokyo police refused to confirm that it had been contacted by Mt. Gox, or that an investigation was underway. He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing police protocol. Lawyers representing Mt. Gox could not be reached immediately for comment. Mt. Gox, led by its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, was once a pioneering platform in the world of online virtual currencies that allowed users to buy Bitcoins or sell them for cash. But the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection last month, saying it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins, along with 100,000 of its own, likely to online hackers. Mt. Gox also said about $28 million of money in its bank accounts was unaccounted for. Mt. Gox subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, where it faces a class-action lawsuit from investors in the exchange who claim fraud was committed. In a bizarre twist, Mt. Gox reported last week that it had found 200,000 missing Bitcoins, worth about $116 million, in an online “wallet” that it had previously thought was empty. That discovery underscored the difficulties of getting a clear accounting of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin holdings, and of verifying its account of its losses. An administrator appointed by the Tokyo District Court is expected to determine soon whether Mt. Gox still has the means to rehabilitate its business, or whether it should be liquidated.",-0.11975555555555556,0.01147462277091907

In a posting on its website in both Japanese and English, the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox announced that it had found the coins in an “old-format wallets,” the virtual currency equivalent of finding money in another pair of pants. In its statement from its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, the company said that after it filed for bankruptcy, it began researching the wallets that were used before June 2011. That, the company said, is when it discovered the coins, which represent about 24 percent of the coins that were missing when the site failed. Last month, Mt. Gox said it had lost 750,000 of its Bitcoin customers’ holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins — essentially its entire stock of Bitcoin, worth more than $450 million. The found coins are worth about $116 million based on today’s rate of $578, according to the online Bitcoin index CoinDesk. “I think that it’s yet another illustration of how incompetently managed that hobbyist operation was,” said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who has written about Bitcoin. “That you can lose that much Bitcoin and then find it tells you that we’re not talking about robust levels of security and control.” Mr. Luria said it was likely that Mt. Gox initially overestimated the amount of Bitcoin it had lost. Many Bitcoin supporters have said that the collapse of Mt. Gox is part of the shakeout of the early, less sophisticated Bitcoin companies that have lost ground to more well-oiled businesses. “Where we are now is in this period of quiet transition before we see the emergence of actual exchanges,” Mr. Luria said. “The hobbyist operations are behind us and the robust, enterprise-grade operations are ahead of us.” Mt. Gox, which originally started as a trading place for the card game Magic: The Gathering, was one of the first exchanges to pop up after Bitcoin mysteriously appeared online in 2009, the brainchild of an anonymous programmer or group of programmers. Mt. Gox’s operations, however, were never totally transparent, and Mr. Karpeles was known as a private man who rarely showed up at public gatherings, or at meetings of the board of the Bitcoin Foundation on which he served until his resignation last month. At its peak, Mt. Gox handled about 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, but began losing significant ground to more sophisticated foreign exchanges like BTC-e, based in Bulgaria, and Bitstamp, in Slovenia, last year. While those companies may be helping to fuel a wider use of virtual currency, they still fall outside the grasp of American regulators. Bitcoin has no federal regulator and is not backed by a central bank. That has appealed to a core group of its more libertarian followers, but offers few options when investments turn sour, as in the case with Mt. Gox. While the Tokyo-based exchange said that it had lost its 850,000 coins, some skeptics said they thought that the coins had actually been stolen. Thieves can pilfer Bitcoin by gaining access through a computer network or taking physical material on which crucial information is stored. Coins can be stored online or offline, otherwise known as “hot” and “cold” wallets. A “cold” wallet can be nothing more than writing down a digital key on a scrap of paper to access one’s Bitcoin, or storing the data on a thumb drive. Access to a “hot” wallet is through a computer network. A veritable army of Internet sleuths has been trying to track down missing Bitcoin since Mt. Gox went offline. Some users have joined a class-action lawsuit in Chicago against the exchange that is trying to keep Mr. Karpeles and his company from moving any money outside the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. “We believe that he’s got a bunch of them, and we believe that he’s got a bunch more,” Jay Edelson, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said in a phone interview on Friday. Mr. Edelson said that he and others believed they had traced about 200,000 coins to a pool operated by Mr. Karpeles. “Our belief is that the reason that they supposedly found this was because they understood that we and others had already found this amount and knew that they were holding it,” Mr. Edelson said. “So the idea that they found it and were going to come public is exactly the opposite of what we believe happened.”",-0.028182608695652173,0.03504227053140096

Bitcoin, digital money backed by no government and “mined” by computers performing complex algorithms, have been largely unregulated, creating a virtual Wild West of programmers and speculators. But as Bitcoin tries to gain greater mainstream acceptance, authorities around the world have begun eyeing it more cautiously, as they might a currency. The spectacular collapse of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has only fanned regulators’ concerns. Regulatory moves in China have been among the more aggressive to date. In December, the Chinese authorities curtailed the use of Bitcoin by banks and payment processors, which helped halve the value of the virtual currency in two weeks. While the government said the general public was free to trade Bitcoin online, the broad fear is that China may eventually impose a sweeping ban on its use offline, as it did in 2009 to Q Coin, a virtual currency issued by Tencent. But Hong Kong has so far remained relatively passive on the regulatory front. The former British colony has retained a separate political and economic system since it returned to Chinese rule, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, says it is not directly regulating Bitcoin, at least for now. Entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are essentially playing regulatory arbitrage. Although firm data is scarce, China is widely seen as the world’s second-largest market for Bitcoin, after the United States, and the restrictions have cooled its nascent Bitcoin scene. By virtue of proximity, businesses in Hong Kong are hoping to capture some of the demand. “Like water, Bitcoin may take the path of least resistance and find its way into Hong Kong,” said Michael Chau, a business professor at the University of Hong Kong. “Because of the city’s proximity to China — and because it has become part of the country since 1997 — Hong Kong has the potential to absorb part of China’s Bitcoin market.” The Chinese customer base of Laser Yuan, the founder of the Hong Kong-based exchange BitCashOut, doubled after the December notice. Three weeks ago, ANX, Hong Kong’s largest Bitcoin exchange, opened what it said was the world’s first brick-and-mortar store for the virtual currency, where customers can buy Bitcoin over the counter. It also set up a Bitcoin vending machine last week. Robocoin, a maker of Bitcoin automated teller machines, will set up its first A.T.M. in Hong Kong this spring, and plans 100 more around the world, none in China, said the company’s chief executive, Jordan Kelley. “We have hundreds and hundreds of Chinese businessmen and entrepreneurs contact us with the purpose of becoming Robocoin operators,” Mr. Kelley said, adding that if China gave him the green light, the company would “have 200 A.T.M.s in China before the end of the year, if not more.” Mr. Shin said he first saw the promise of Bitcoin last year, when the coins were worth $25 apiece, compared with about $620 now. After raising $2.5 million, he and his business partners built IceDrill, an operation in Montreal where racks of speedy computers race to generate Bitcoin. But he is now selling part of his stake in the Canadian mine and focusing on his start-up in Hong Kong, which he said could be “the capital of Bitcoin in Asia.” Mr. Shin recently hired Jake Smith, a well-connected Bitcoin enthusiast who worked for Li Xiaolai — a Chinese investor who reportedly holds 100,000 coins — to get Chinese to buy into the companies listed on his platform. “When the government comes out and puts constraints on Bitcoin in China, investors naturally look at Hong Kong — not Singapore, not Korea — for substitution,” Mr. Shin said. Hong Kong operates in a type of regulatory limbo, so uncertainty reigns as much as opportunity. If China clamps down further, Hong Kong may be forced to rethink its stance. John Greenwood, chief economist at Invesco and architect of Hong Kong’s exchange-rate system, said that whether the Chinese authorities would toughen measures depended on whether Bitcoin became so prevalent that it undermined China’s capital controls. “China’s mainland residents can buy things with Bitcoin from Europe or North America or anywhere else in the world, or make transfers,” Mr. Greenwood said. “It’s a hole in the dike, a leakage from China’s system of foreign-exchange control.” Entrepreneurs like Mr. Shin also face a legacy of past ventures that have proved problematic. Two once-prominent Bitcoin crowdfunding platforms, BTCST and Bitfunder, are now defunct. BTCST, which offered Bitcoin-denominated securities that claimed to return up to 7 percent a week, has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and with running a Ponzi scheme. “The operating environment is much clearer,” Mr. Shin said. “The Hong Kong government has acknowledged Bitcoin as a commodity, so we have clarity on both fronts here as well.” Then there is the need for better basic infrastructure and consumer awareness, a challenge for Bitcoin around the world. For example, few businesses let customers make payments with the currency. In Hong Kong, they largely amount to a boutique hotel, a flower shop, a tailor, a music teacher and a Beijing-style crepe restaurant. On the eve of the Chinese New Year in January, the three co-founders of the Bitcoin exchange ANX took to the bustling streets of the Lan Kwai Fong entertainment district to hand out 50,000 red envelopes, each carrying a little more than a dollar’s worth of Bitcoin. “I use Bitcoin to buy stuff online all the time,” Ben Lau, an online marketer, said as he stood on the sidewalk using his smartphone to scan the QR code — an image that works like a bar code — on the voucher he had just received. But Mr. Lau was in the minority. Even months after Bitcoin leapt into the limelight, most passers-by had little idea about what it does, and some associated it with drugs and fauds. When the after-work crowd diminished, the co-founders went to a nearby bar to check on rumors that it had recently started accepting Bitcoin. A few beers later, Ken Lo, managing director of ANX, waved for the bill and asked to pay in the virtual currency. “A customer’s friend thought our bar had a matching name — Bit Point — with Bitcoin, so he helped us set this up,” said Gaga Lam, the bar’s manager. “We haven’t really tried it out yet.” Her iPad Mini displayed the website of BitPay, the Bitcoin payment processor in which Asian billionaire Li Ka-shing was an early investor. But the group ended up paying with a credit card after a few unsuccessful tries. “We can do better than that,” Mr. Lo said, referring to his company’s Bitcoin payment solution. “We clear faster than the banks, our transaction fee is lower than credit card companies, and there would be no chargebacks. And Bitcoin fans will flock to your bar in droves.”",0.10999032258064517,0.07226734026129185
226,Placing Their Bets on Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/business/international/in-hong-kong-betting-big-on-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-19T20:03:40+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"HONG KONG — By day, David Shin is an investment banker at a major financial firm. By night and in pretty much every other free minute, he is an entrepreneur looking to break into Hong Kong’s growing Bitcoin scene. Even as concerns swirl about the long-term viability of the virtual currency, Mr. Shin is raising money, courting clients and hiring staff to build a sort of stock exchange for Bitcoin-oriented companies. Mr. Shin, 38, plans to start his venture, CryptoMex, at the end of April. “I believe Bitcoin will bring about a brave new world of money,” he said. “The Internet started out as a revolutionary protocol, became more easy to use over time, and saw an explosive growth rate. The same is happening with Bitcoin.” Mr. Shin joins a growing field of technology experts, financial players and crypto-geeks who are betting that an unfavorable regulatory environment in mainland China has put this special administrative region — with its more laissez-faire attitude — on the edge of something big. Bitcoin, digital money backed by no government and “mined” by computers performing complex algorithms, have been largely unregulated, creating a virtual Wild West of programmers and speculators. But as Bitcoin tries to gain greater mainstream acceptance, authorities around the world have begun eyeing it more cautiously, as they might a currency. The spectacular collapse of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has only fanned regulators’ concerns. Regulatory moves in China have been among the more aggressive to date. In December, the Chinese authorities curtailed the use of Bitcoin by banks and payment processors, which helped halve the value of the virtual currency in two weeks. While the government said the general public was free to trade Bitcoin online, the broad fear is that China may eventually impose a sweeping ban on its use offline, as it did in 2009 to Q Coin, a virtual currency issued by Tencent. But Hong Kong has so far remained relatively passive on the regulatory front. The former British colony has retained a separate political and economic system since it returned to Chinese rule, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, says it is not directly regulating Bitcoin, at least for now. Entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are essentially playing regulatory arbitrage.

227,How Russian Spies Hid Behind Bitcoin in Hacking Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/technology/bitcoin-russian-hacking.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-07-13T23:30:46+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — In early 2016, Russian intelligence officers obtained a new pool of the virtual currency Bitcoin. They quickly put the digital money to work. The Russian spies used some of the Bitcoins to pay for the registration of a website, dcleaks.com, where they would later post emails that had been stolen from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. When the operatives needed a computer server to host the dcleaks site, they paid for that with Bitcoins as well. The transactions were detailed in an indictment on Friday from the Justice Department, in which prosecutors accused 12 Russian operatives of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign through a sophisticated hacking scheme. The indictment provided one of the clearest illustrations to date of the inner workings of the Russian operation that carried out the hacking of the Democratic Party and other targets. It also showed how cryptocurrencies — and the anonymity they provide — have become both a tool and a challenge for intelligence agencies in the battles between nation states. “This is the first clear example in court documents of cryptocurrency being used to purchase capabilities that could be leveraged in attacks on national security,” said Jonathan Levin, a co-founder of Chainalysis, a firm that helps governments track cryptocurrency payments. Financial transactions have been one of the trickiest parts of intelligence operations because electronic payment networks and checks are generally off limits to undercover spies. That has led to famous scenes of covert exchanges of suitcases full of cash. The Bitcoin network allows anyone to move millions of dollars across the world without any in-person meetings, and without the approval of any financial institutions. First released in 2009 by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was designed to operate without any central authority that could block transactions or verify the identities of the people involved. All Bitcoin transactions and wallets are recorded on a database known as the blockchain, by a network of computers that anyone can join. The unusual structure has long made Bitcoin a primary means of payment for drugs on online black markets, and more recently as a method for making ransom payments. When Bitcoin’s price spiked last year, many big financial institutions took an interest in the virtual currency as a new kind of investment and have looked to move it away from its unsavory associations. But Friday’s allegations are likely to make that effort more difficult. While the Russians accused of attacking Ms. Clinton’s campaign also used traditional currencies, the indictment said they had “principally used Bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity.” Bitcoin, the indictment added, “allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relations with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.” The Russians took several steps to obscure their Bitcoin transactions, according to the indictment. They bought some Bitcoins on so-called peer-to-peer exchanges, where buyers and sellers can interact directly without exchanges collecting details on either side. The Russians also created Bitcoins themselves through the process known as mining, the indictment said. With mining, computers compete to unlock new Bitcoins by solving difficult computational problems. This requires expensive equipment and lots of electricity, but that was apparently not a hindrance to the Russians. The operatives used the Bitcoins to pay for much of the computer infrastructure that was employed in the hacking attacks, the indictment said. That included payments for a server in Malaysia that hosted dcleaks.com, and money sent to a Romanian company that registered the domain name. In March 2016, the indictment said, the Russians also used Bitcoin to buy a so-called virtual private network account that allowed them to obscure their internet protocol address and their location when they went online. They used that VPN account to operate a Twitter account known as Guccifer_2, which became infamous after releasing some of the emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. The Russians also used Bitcoin to pay for the servers from which they launched malware campaigns and “spearphishing” attacks against the Democratic National Committee, according to the indictment. In those attacks, it said, the Russian operatives gained control of the email accounts of American officials. American investigators were able to use the blockchain to go back and identify some of the transactions that Russian agents made. But it was not enough to stop them from making the transactions at the time. “The fact that cryptocurrencies are global and real time means that you might only find out about these things after the fact,” Mr. Levin said. “We need to think about the responsibilities that we all have in a world where payments move seamlessly across borders in the blink of an eye.”",-0.014194117647058828,0.03493389780154486

The publicly traded New York private equity and hedge fund firm Fortress Investment Group and two other investors are buying a stake in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, a San Francisco-based hedge fund operator that buys and sells virtual currencies. The creation of the partnership represents a significant step in the push to move Bitcoin into the financial mainstream at a time when several well-publicized claims of theft have pointed to potential weaknesses in the digital currency economy. Pantera Capital, the parent of Pantera Bitcoin, was founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, a veteran of the hedge fund giant Tiger Management. For most of its existence, Pantera was a macro hedge fund. But since 2011, Mr. Morehead has grown increasingly fascinated with Bitcoin, he said in an interview on Tuesday. In recent months, he said, the firm’s staff of 16 has shifted its attention to work full time on investments in the virtual currency world. “We’re very excited about the promise of Bitcoin and how it can transform the way we move money,” Mr. Morehead said. “The promise and possibilities here are very broad.” When Pantera made its first regulatory filing in December, its Bitcoin fund was worth $147 million. That is significantly larger than the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a $55 million fund run by the New York firm SecondMarket that holds virtual currencies on behalf of investors. The big venture capital firms Benchmark and Ribbit Capital are taking stakes in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, along with Fortress. All are committing to buy and sell Bitcoin and other virtual currencies through Pantera. Michael E. Novogratz, an executive at Fortress, had previously talked about his interest in Bitcoin, but until now it has been unclear how the firm was approaching digital money as an investment. Moving forward, Fortress said that it would make all of its Bitcoin purchases through Pantera.“This partnership brings together leading companies with a range of relevant expertise, well positioned to lead and capitalize on a potentially transformative evolution,” Mr. Novogratz said. In the years after the Bitcoin program was released by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, most of the dominant players were small start-ups with few links to the traditional financial world. Part of the allure of Bitcoin was that it allowed users to move and store money outside the banking system. Recently, however, a number of pioneers, like the Japanese exchange Mt. Gox, have run into trouble, shaking confidence in the entire Bitcoin network. At the same time, investors and financial firms with more established credentials have been expressing their growing interest in Bitcoin. Last week, Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street firm to issue a research report on Bitcoin’s potential to shake up different parts of the financial system. Much of the research has been focused on Bitcoin not just as a form of digital money, but also as a new payment system, buttressed by the computers linked into the Bitcoin network. The system is run according to a prewritten set of rules, which determines how the coins are created and moved between digital wallets. Mr. Morehead’s management firm is giving up some of its ownership in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, which manages the Bitcoin fund. But all of the companies involved in Pantera Bitcoin Partners will continue to make their own investments in virtual currency start-up companies. Earlier this week, all four firms teamed up to make a $20 million investment in Xapo, a start-up that offers to secure the information needed to unlock Bitcoins in guarded vaults so that they cannot be reached by hackers.

Kirschner of Los Angeles. “I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin.”  Mr. Nakamoto said in the statement that he first heard the term Bitcoin last month from his son after Newsweek contacted the son about the article. He also noted that he had recently fallen on hard times, working as a polltaker and substitute teacher. And in a disclosure clearly meant to challenge his identification as a technological revolutionary, Mr. Nakamoto said he discontinued his Internet service in 2013 because he could not afford it. The statement increased the pressure on Newsweek, which had just returned to print under new owners with the Bitcoin article on its cover. It also appeared to lay the groundwork for possible litigation against Newsweek, legal experts said. Mr. Nakamoto included assertions that his prospects for gainful employment have been harmed by the article and that the “false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings and their families.” Newsweek has vigorously defended its reporting and the accuracy of its identification of Mr. Nakamoto, which the article’s author, Leah McGrath Goodman, has said was based on months of reporting. On Monday, Newsweek said that it had not received any statement or letter from either Mr. Nakamoto or his lawyer. “If and when we do,” the magazine said, “we will respond as necessary.” Once a division of The Washington Post Company, Newsweek has struggled in recent years and been passed among several owners. In 2010, The Post sold it to the businessman Sidney Harman, who later teamed up with Barry Diller. They subsequently sold it to IBT Media, a small digital publishing company, who installed as editor in chief Jim Impoco, a former Sunday business editor at The New York Times.  IBT’s owners trumpeted Newsweek’s return to print as reflecting a renewed interest in the storied brand. The Bitcoin article created a splash, but now the magazine finds itself facing pointed questions.  Bill Grueskin, dean of academic affairs at the Columbia Journalism School, noted how unusual it was for “the very person at the heart of story to directly challenge the story.” “I don’t understand Newsweek’s response,” Mr. Grueskin said. “It feels like something done by lawyers rather than editors.” In reporting on Bitcoin, Newsweek has tapped into a phenomenon: a passionate online community of believers in a digital currency that operates independently of governments and banks. Fueled by speculators and a few businesses that use the currency to conduct businesses, the price of a Bitcoin has shot up in value, making the entire system worth billions of dollars. The mystery of who created the system has fascinated other publications and technologists since Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a still unknown individual, or group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto.  Newsweek said it had found its man, identifying him as Mr. Nakamoto of Temple City, Calif., whose full name is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. But from the moment the article was published, skeptics tried to poke holes in the reporting, while others objected to Ms. Goodman’s aggressive approach with Mr. Nakamoto, which led him to call the police when she appeared at his front door.  It was that encounter that Ms. Goodman has pointed to as evidence buttressing Newsweek’s claim that Mr. Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,” he said, according to the article. “It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”  Yet in the statement issued by his lawyer, Mr. Nakamoto said that despite some programming skills, he lacked the expertise that would seem crucial to creating Bitcoin. “I have no knowledge of nor have I ever worked on cryptography, peer-to-peer systems or alternative currencies,” he said. If Mr. Nakamoto sued Newsweek asserting that he did not invent Bitcoin, legal experts say that his most likely claim would be that he was depicted in a “false light.” Even though what Newsweek said about Mr. Nakamoto would generally be viewed as complimentary — a genius programmer who created a potentially revolutionary virtual currency — he would still have grounds to bring a lawsuit.  “People get offended when certain kinds of false things are said about them,” said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, “even if they are too positive.” He cited the example of the baseball great Warren Spahn who sued in the 1960s over being incorrectly described as having earned a bronze star in World War II.  The rationale for a claim of being portrayed in a “false light,” Mr. Volokh said, was simply that “I don’t want people to think things about me that aren’t true.” Mr. Nakamoto painted a bleak picture of his recent life in his statement, saying he is in frail health. “I have not been able to find steady work as an engineer or programmer for 10 years,” he said. “I am trying to recover from prostate surgery in October 2012 and a stroke I suffered in October of 2013.” He ended his statement saying: “This will be our last public statement on this matter. I ask that you now respect our privacy.”",0.032402,0.02919718614718615

Mr. Casares, a veteran tech entrepreneur who hails from the tiny Patagonian town of Esquel, is setting his sights on an equally volatile space: virtual currencies. Xapo, his new start-up that opened to the public this week, provides a Bitcoin wallet combined with a cold storage vault, allowing for transfers. The vault is a series of physical servers all over the world that has biometric access, security and is filmed around the clock, Mr. Casares said. The vault also comes with insurance, provided by the Meridian Insurance Group.  As security concerns abound for Bitcoin believers, especially after the recent collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange, Mr. Casares may have struck at the right time. An estimated 750,000 customers lost more than $450 million worth of Bitcoins when the site went dark and filed for bankruptcy last month. The idea for the company germinated in early 2011 when Mr. Casares bought his first Bitcoins, three for approximately $3 a piece, he recalled.  He kept buying more. He then looked for a way to store them and so built a so-called vault for his personal collection. Soon after, friends began asking if they could also store their supply there and he obliged.  Financial institutions made similar requests, and over the last year, Xapo stored Bitcoins for family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds. The Argentine would not name them, citing confidentiality, but said about half were based in the United States and the rest spread  over the globe. On Thursday, Mr. Casares announced that Xapo, based in Palo Alto, Calif., received $20 million in funding in a round led by Benchmark Capital. Ribbit Capital and Fortress Investment Group also joined. Mr.  Casares also has the tech credentials to win that kind of backing from Silicon Valley after having run Lemon, a digital wallet that was acquired last year by LifeLock for about $43 million.  Matt Cohler, a partner at Benchmark Capital and a former Facebook and LinkedIn executive, said he backed the company in part because he believed it was making an important contribution to building trust in the Bitcoin ecosystem. He also noted that Mr. Casares’s experiences in Argentina and Brazil, where credit access remains scarce, have immense value. “His personal passion for Bitcoin and his depth and breadth of expertise in global fintech are unparalleled,” Mr. Cohler said.  Wedbush Securities in a February research note estimated that nearly $86 million of venture capital has been invested in Bitcoin-related companies, mostly in the last 12 months.  Xapo’s team includes Federico Murrone, co-founder and chief operating officer, and a longtime associate, and Carlos Rienzi, its senior vice president of security, who was formerly a systems engineer at Cisco Systems. Cindy McAdam is co-founder and president, and Mary Chan is controller. Ted Rogers joined Xapo this year as senior vice president of business development. He previously lived in Brazil and was a general partner at Arpex Capital, a venture capital firm. He is currently a limited partner at that firm.

231,A Turnaround for Bitcoin at SXSW,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/a-turnaround-for-bitcoin-at-sxsw/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-11T23:10:18+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," This year, it is hard to avoid the upstart virtual currency. Bitcoin has been the subject of official events at SXSW’s largest venues, and was also the buzz at after-parties that had luminaries from the tech world in attendance. It was soon after SXSW last year that Bitcoin won an informal stamp of approval from the Treasury Department. That helped send the price of a Bitcoin on a wild ride, starting at around $50 and rising to more than $250, before a quick crash. Since then, it has experienced several run-ups and quick drops. Most recently the price was sent careening after the collapse of the first big Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, which raised questions about the long-term viability of Bitcoin.  Still, the sheer number of events, and the level of interest in virtual currency, at SXSW underscored the degree of fascination that Bitcoin is generating in the mainstream tech sector, and the broad applications that some people are imagining for it.   “Anyone who has any interest in technology has to be interested in this,” said Russell Castagnaro, who was attending his second SXSW for his job with the Hawaii Information Consortium. Mr. Castagnaro has attended as many of the Bitcoin events as he has been able to pack in, finishing with a meetup on Tuesday morning of Bitangels, a group that is trying to connect start-ups with angel investors.  Mr. Castagnaro is hoping that governments will begin to use the ledger that is a part of the Bitcoin system to transfer property and make payments easier. There were people from about a dozen different countries at the Bitangels events, and only a few of them were involved with Bitcoin companies. Even at events not specifically about Bitcoin, the topic frequently came up. At a panel discussion on “The Future of Money,” hosted by Yahoo, one panelist was from PayPal and the other from BitPay, a company that enables merchants to accept virtual currency payments. The rapper Nas brought it up during a panel discussion that featured the venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a firm that has invested about $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. Mr. Horowitz said he believed Bitcoin was like “the Internet of money.” At one of the most exclusive parties at the conference, hosted by Nas and Mr. Horowitz, the two kibitzed with Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, a Bitcoin company they have both recently invested in. “Once you get people talking about this, you can’t get them to talk about anything else,” Mr. Ehrsam said. For Bitcoin entrepreneurs, the rise from scrappy outsiders to tech world insiders has been a bit dizzying. A year ago, Coinbase, for instance, was barely up and running and consisted of just Mr. Ehrsam and a partner. This year, his first time at SXSW, Mr. Ehrsam was invited to be the main speaker at a session on Monday afternoon in one of the conference’s largest venues, which drew a large crowd.   Mr. Ehrsam’s event, and many others, have frequently had to address the scandals that have plagued the virtual currency, including the downfall of Mt. Gox, and the frequent use of it for illegal means. At the Bitangels meeting, a man from Spain said, “I am really skeptical about Bitcoin, but I’m willing to learn,” while an entrepreneur from Los Angeles said he was concerned “about the snake oil aspects of it.” Mr. Ehrsam, like many other Bitcoin backers, argued that Mt. Gox was a company that used Bitcoin, but it was not important to the underlying decentralized network that Bitcoin runs on. As a result, he said, its collapse should not threaten the basic technology that was invented in 2009 to allow digital money to be moved around the Internet. Many of the Bitcoin start-ups at the conference were pitching services that would make virtual currency accounts more secure with things like multiple-signature capabilities.   Bitcoin fans are hoping that the events at SXSW will help broaden the acceptance of virtual currencies beyond the early adopters and speculators who have driven many of the price moves until now. But these fans are also imagining such rapid growth for the currency that they think a year from now, Bitcoin may be helping SXSW rather than the other way around. “Bitcoin could help SXSW continue to evolve as some of the other trends drop away,” said Michael Terpin, the founder of Bitangels.",0.09167368421052631,0.060513262322472845
232,Will the Real Satoshi Nakamoto Please Stand Up?,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/will-the-real-satoshi-nakamoto-please-stand-up/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-11T19:57:41+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"TOKYO — Satoshi Nakamoto of Fujisawa, Japan, is a shoe repairman. Satoshi Nakamoto of Hiroshima is preparing to open a men’s clothing store. And Satoshi Nakamoto in Tokyo is a Primal Scream-loving former worker at a rental music studio, according to the studio’s Twitter feed. There are at least 28 other Satoshi Nakamotos with listed phone numbers in Japan, and even more on Facebook. Like Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the California man profiled in a recent Newsweek article, they all deny creating Bitcoin, the virtual currency. The identity of the math genius credited as the architect of Bitcoin has been a long-running curiosity among Bitcoin believers and the public at large ever since the online currency was created. But since the Newsweek article emerged, there has been a renewed interest in pinning down the “real” Satoshi Nakamoto. And although it has been widely suggested that the name may just be a pseudonym for a person or group of people, those who are named such have been getting a lot of attention. “It’s not me. I only heard of Bitcoin a few months ago, and it sounds risky,” Satoshi Nakamoto said from his “Leather Clinic” shoe-and-bag repair shop in Fujisawa, just south of Tokyo. “I was amused to hear we had the same name, but I prefer real money to virtual money,” said Satoshi Nakamoto of Hiroshima, who recently moved to Tokyo to open “Decollo,” a clothing store for fashion-conscious “salarymen” in Tokyo. Newsweek called the name Satoshi Nakamoto “distinctive.” But if the magazine’s investigation had extended to Japan, where that name originates, it would have found that neither of those names are, in fact, distinctive. About 50,000 people share the Nakamoto family name in Japan, written here using at least five different combinations of characters, according to Hiroshi Morioka, an expert on the study of Japanese surnames. In its most common rendering — using the characters for “middle” and “main,” — Nakamoto is Japan’s 487th most common family name out of over 100,000 known surnames here, he said. “In general, he said, any name in the top 500 is considered a major name,” Mr. Morioka said in an email. By comparison, the 487th most common last name in the United States is Bryan, he said. Satoshi, meanwhile, was among Japan’s top most common given names for boys in the 1960s and 1970s, though the moniker’s popularity has fallen in recent years, according to an annual survey of given names by Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance. It does not help that the exact rendering in Japanese of the Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin fame remain unknown. A Japanese translation exists of the 2008 paper in which Mr. Nakamoto laid out his design of a new digital currency. Prepared by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin angel investor, the Japanese document is signed in Japanese. But the characters used were just guesswork, Mr. Ver said in an email. “There isn’t any evidence that the Bitcoin Satoshi ever wrote anything in Japanese, ever,” he said. Written in a variety of ways, other Satoshi Nakamotos identified across Japan include an obstetrician, a councilman, a tour bus operator; an official in the Tottori prefecture office, the president of a company that makes food sterilization devices, a marketing consultant, as well as employees of Mitsubishi Electric, JFE Steel, Itochu and Asahi Calpis Beverage. One of the likelier candidates, a researcher in telecommunications engineering at Kobe University, did not return a request for comment. Of course, there is the issue of English language ability. Most Satoshi Nakamotos here are unlikely to be able to write in the lucid English that characterize the Bitcoin founder’s known writing style. If the name is indeed a pseudonym, one frequently cited candidate is the mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki, of Kyoto University. The professor shot to Bitcoin fame last year after Ted Nelson, the American technologist, singled him out as a figure who seemed to fit the known traits of the Bitcoin creator: genius, reclusiveness and English ability. Mr. Mochizuki, has so far declined to give any statement to the media. A research assistant said that he “absolutely refused to comment.”",0.12536176470588234,0.032730137509549284
233,Virtual Exchange Plans Are Sought in New York,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/new-york-financial-regulator-solicits-virtual-currency-proposals/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-11T19:34:38+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," On Tuesday, Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of financial services, officially asked for proposals to create regulated virtual currency exchanges. The same day, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulator, issued a stern warning to investors about the risks of Bitcoin. “The companies that are now being asked to come apply in this order are going to largely be the companies that say, ‘We have the desire, wherewithal and the resources to do this the right way,’ ” Mr. Lawsky said in an interview. “We are creating a situation where we’ll hopefully be driving consumer confidence in the firms that want to come here now and set up their exchanges with all the appropriate protections in place.” Mr. Lawsky’s office, the Department of Financial Services, said it was working on a “BitLicense” for companies operating in New York, but it has not yet unveiled the regulatory framework that would ultimately guide any proposals. In a statement, the office said it intended to do so “no later than the end of the second quarter of 2014.” But until other states and countries put their own guidelines in place, registration in New York can go only so far since companies operate across state lines and international boundaries. “If we do it right, it could be a nice model for other states,” Mr. Lawsky said. Government agencies have been struggling with just how to regulate Bitcoin, the computer-driven virtual currency that has no backing from a central bank. Buyers and sellers of Bitcoins have largely operated on the fringes of the financial system, which has appealed to a core group of anti-establishment enthusiasts. It has also made the value of Bitcoin fluctuate wildly, and it provides few options when things go south. The collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the industry’s largest online exchanges, sent many users scrambling to figure out if there was any way to recover the nearly $500 million the company said it had lost. In its warning, the regulatory body known as Finra said that “speculative trading in Bitcoins carries significant risk,” and it warned that “as with so many other ‘hot’ or new trends, fraudsters may see the latest digital currency trend as a chance to steal your money through old-fashioned fraud.” Bitcoin supporters are quick to point out, however, that Mt. Gox was one of the earliest Bitcoin companies, and that it had been losing ground to newer businesses that often came with strong backing from established venture capital firms. That shift has led Bitcoin to a crossroads, as some government authorities prepare for virtual currency to reach a broader audience. Mr. Lawsky has made his openness to Bitcoin clear. He said on Tuesday that his office would be looking for sufficient cybersecurity protections and capital reserves and would conduct background checks on any potential management teams. “I think it’s a very big deal,” said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. “I think this is the type of regulatory treatment Bitcoin was hoping for.” The lack of regulation has contributed to Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations. In less than five years, the value of a Bitcoin has gone from just a few dollars to more than $1,000. Bitcoin is now trading around $631, according to the virtual currency website CoinDesk. Bitcoin supporters are preparing for governments to take more active roles in the virtual currency. The Bitcoin Foundation, an industry advocacy group, announced on Tuesday that it had added two full-time staff members, bringing its work force to eight. Jim Harper, a director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian research group, will join the foundation as global policy counsel. Amy Weiss, who previously served as a White House deputy press secretary under Bill Clinton, will be serving as an outside consultant to the foundation. Both, like all of the foundation’s staff, will be paid in Bitcoins.",0.10601333333333333,0.08489523208273209

The foundation announced on Tuesday that it had hired Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the libertarian research group the Cato Institute, as global policy counsel. Mr. Harper will act as a liaison to governments around the world for the foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group that has previously met with federal regulators in an effort to push for a broader understanding and adoption of Bitcoin.  “Like many in the Bitcoin community, he is passionate about doing his part in achieving Bitcoin’s social and economic potential,” a spokeswoman for the foundation, Jinyoung Lee Englund, said in an email. Mr. Harper’s appointment with the foundation is effective immediately. He will remain at Cato in the reduced role of a senior fellow.  The addition of Mr. Harper brings the group’s total number of full-time employees to eight, all of whom are paid in Bitcoin. It has also brought on as an outside consultant Amy Weiss, who has previously served as a White House deputy press secretary under Bill Clinton and as vice president of public affairs for the United Nations Foundation.  The expansion of the foundation comes as regulators weigh how to manage a rapidly evolving marketplace with no central regulator or authority. The announcements came the same day as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulator, issued an investor alert warning of Bitcoin’s risks. “As with so many other ‘hot’ or new trends, fraudsters may see the latest digital currency trend as a chance to steal your money through old-fashioned fraud,” the warning stated.  Last month, the Bitcoin community was rattled by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which was at one point the largest online Bitcoin exchange.  Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Sunday after announcing that nearly 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins, worth close to $500 million, had gone missing. The company has also filed for bankruptcy in Japan.  The bankruptcy brought even more scrutiny to a fledgling currency that already has some regulators worried about its potential use in drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Federal prosecutors are currently investigating Silk Road, the now-defunct online marketplace accused of aiding money laundering and other illicit transactions. Authorities in other countries are also struggling with just how to oversee Bitcoin. Russia, for example, has banned the currency altogether, while other countries, including Germany, have generally favored the new technology.  Mr. Harper previously served as a member of the Department of Homeland Security’s Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee. He was already a member of the Bitcoin Foundation before his appointment as global policy counsel, and he has made it clear that he favors integrating Bitcoin into existing regulation rather than creating new rules specific to virtual currency. “Technology-specific regulation is generally eschewed by most people,” Mr. Harper said on Tuesday. “So the idea that Bitcoin should be specifically regulated doesn’t make a lot of sense.”",-0.012989655172413798,0.035322622779519336

Lyn Ulbricht’s son, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in October and charged with operating the Silk Road, the online drug bazaar where Bitcoin was the only money accepted. Ms. Ulbricht has been raising money to pay for her’s son’s legal bills, and she thought that the crowd at SXSW would be receptive to Mr. Ulbricht’s cause. By Monday, she looked tired after making appearances at several Bitcoin-related events. At each appearance, she handed out fliers with the website her family set up, FreeRoss.org, and a QR code that allowed donors to give money immediately. “I see it as my job to pay the people who can help my son,” she said after the biggest Bitcoin-related panel at SXSW, where she was the first person in line to ask a question and mention her effort to the crowd. She and her husband, who run a business renting houses in Costa Rica, have made her son’s cause into a nearly full-time job. She says she is taking a class on Twitter and Facebook to learn how to use social media to promote the effort. She had used neither — and had not possessed a Bitcoin — before her son’s arrest. “It’s a whole new world for us,” she said. When she has a chance to make her pitch, Ms. Ulbricht has not been talking about the merits of the case. She says she doesn’t know more than what is in the public documents. But Mr. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty and Ms. Ulbricht has said she wants people to know him not as an indicted suspect, but as the “wonderful person” she knows. Friends and acquaintances described Mr. Ulbricht in a recent New York Times article as soulful and sensitive. The biggest deterrent to her efforts, she says, is the government allegations that Mr. Ulbricht solicited several murders for hire. Those charges did not end up as formal charges in the indictment that the government recently filed, and Ms. Ulbricht says she is confident they are not true. “I kept reading these awful things that don’t sound like him at all,” she said. She has also been arguing that her son’s case matters more broadly.  “This case opens new legal territory and the government is poised to set Internet and financial law with it,” the website she helped build says. “Bad law could be ushered in and we will be forced to live with it.” The trip to Austin was a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Ulbricht. She and her husband raised their family in Austin, but they recently moved to New York to be near their son, who is in jail in Brooklyn awaiting trial. Since she began raising money for her son, the donations have not been pouring in. Ms. Ulbricht says that many people have the perception that her family, or her son, was rich from Silk Road, where the operator collected a commission on each purchase. But she said that the family did not have enough to pay for the bills, and whatever Bitcoins that Mr. Ulbricht owned when he was arrested are off limits until the case is over. Ms. Ulbricht said she had not seen a major uptick in donations after attending Texas Bitcoin Conference, which took place last week, and SXSW this week. Only a few people took the fliers she handed out to attendees coming out of the Bitcoin talk on Monday. But she said she had received moral support from enough people, which she said she told her son about when she spoke with him by phone on Monday. “No one is going to be mean to me,” she said. “I am a mom who is in a very bad position. At worst case, they just ignore me. But people have been very kind.”",-0.03951162790697675,0.012568710359408038

Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said in a television interview on Monday that he did not have a firm grasp of Bitcoin, which has been much in the news after the collapse of a major exchange, Mt. Gox, and after Newsweek claimed to have found the currency’s creator.   “Wow,” Mr. Gorman said, smiling, when Maria Bartiromo of the Fox Business Network asked him about Bitcoin. “I’m not sure I understand it.” “It’s totally surreal,” he said. “I mean, who’s the founder? This guy in L.A.? What’s going on with Mt. Gox? There’s so many moving parts.” “I would think and hope that the regulators are paying a lot of attention to it,” he added. Another bank chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who runs JPMorgan Chase, has also expressed skepticism about Bitcoin, calling it a “terrible store of value” that could be “replicated over and over.” “The question isn’t whether we accept it,” Mr. Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC. “The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin?” These pronouncements from big banks’ chief executives are significant for the Bitcoin proponents who think that the best hope for the virtual currency is to become integrated into the existing financial system. Raj Date, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who recently joined the board of a start-up focused on Bitcoin, said recently that “market makers” could help iron out Bitcoin’s volatility. But another strain of Bitcoin fans thinks that the currency can thrive outside of traditional banking, offering a more seamless way to transfer money around the globe. Despite the skepticism from bank chief executives, Bitcoin has found a more welcome reception in the research department of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which predicted in a report in December that it could “become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers.”",0.16620714285714283,0.0005654761904761936
237,Newsweek Returns to Print and Sets Off a Bitcoin Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/business/media/newsweek-returns-to-print-and-sets-off-a-bitcoin-storm.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-08T02:10:53+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"After being out of print for 14 months, Newsweek wanted its return to the newsstands to land with a splash. So it put out an issue with a darkened cover featuring a theatrical silver mask, and made an explosive claim: It had uncovered the mysterious founder of the digital currency Bitcoin. Within hours of publication, however, the story seemed to swell from a splash to a runaway tsunami of attention, much of it negative. The man Newsweek identified as Bitcoin’s founder, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a reclusive train collector from California, gave a two-hour interview to The Associated Press saying that the story was wrong.  Reporters and commentators quickly questioned whether the writer, Leah McGrath Goodman, had produced the definitive proof her magazine had promised, noting that the central quote from Mr. Nakamoto appeared to fall short of a clear confirmation.  Amateur sleuths on the Internet tried to challenge the evidence in the face of a heavy dose of hostility aimed at the author directly.  Newsweek’s editor in chief, Jim Impoco, on Friday offered a vigorous defense of the article. “We are absolutely standing by this,” he said in a phone interview. He added that the idea that the story hung on the brief confirmation from Mr. Nakamoto was wrong. “It was an exhaustive investigation,” he said. “We brought in help from M.I.T. All leads led to him.” Ms. Goodman on Friday seemed surprised at the ferocity of the attacks against her. On “CBS This Morning,” she insisted again that Mr. Nakamoto had definitely confirmed to her that he was a founder. Referring to a bizarre scene on Thursday, when reporters who were camped outside Mr. Nakamoto’s house formed a caravan to follow him down the highway to the A.P. interview, she told CBS: “Seeing him flee the scene and now deny it, I have to say it is mystifying to me.”  The article describes a brief conversation outside Mr. Nakamoto’s house witnessed by two deputies from the sheriff’s office, in which Ms. Goodman asked him about Bitcoin. “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,” she quotes him as saying. “It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.” Mr. Nakamoto told The A.P. that he had misunderstood what she was asking him. In an emailed statement to The New York Times, Ms. Goodman wrote in part: “My conversation with Mr. Nakamoto followed two months of team-based research that connected the dots to him — and only him — in multiple ways. I can definitively say that in our conversation, he made clear he understood we were talking about Bitcoin.”  Adam L. Penenberg, a journalism professor at New York University and editor of the digital newsletter PandoDaily, was among the skeptical commentators, tweeting: “High risk, high reward, disastrous if you’re wrong. Putting it on the cover with such flimsy proof was a poor editorial decision.” In featuring the Bitcoin story, Newsweek was engaging a particularly passionate audience. Bitcoin, a virtual currency that is meant to allow smooth financial transactions across borders without government involvement, has a zealous group of devoted technologists, speculators and libertarian ideologues. It has also recently made headlines in several areas — for its big-name investors like the Winklevoss twins, and, most recently, the spectacular bankruptcy filing of a trading exchange, Mt. Gox, with more than $450 million worth of coins reported to have gone missing. And as Bitcoin has gone from a fringe digital experiment to a mainstream digital experiment, the search for its secretive creator, or creators, has become something of a holy grail. There are few leads to go on — other than the name, “Satoshi Nakamoto,” similar to Mr. Nakamoto’s own name, and some writings online, including a white paper from 2008. Still, publications like The New Yorker, Fast Company and Vice have spent significant reporting time trying to reveal the Bitcoin inventor’s identity. The New Yorker’s piece was typical, concluding: “The currency is both real and elusive — just like its founder.”  In her article and in later interviews, Ms. Goodman (who goes by the Twitter handle @truth-eater) said she had delved into databases and even worked with a team of forensic investigators to track down Mr. Nakamoto’s identity. She said she got his email address from a company where he bought his model trains. The disclosure of the lengths she went to investigate Mr. Nakamoto seemed only to enrage Bitcoin fans. Many on the web, and in particular on the social news site Reddit, expressed sympathy for the toll this has taken on Mr. Nakamoto, whether he is the creator of Bitcoin or not, and were outraged that Newsweek saw fit to invade his privacy. “I hope the media realizes just how low they’ve gone this time, and though I don’t take any satisfaction in saying this, I hope the public backlash on them is breathtakingly vicious,” wrote a commentator with the handle ferretinjapan.   On Friday, Newsweek issued a plea for restraint, saying in a statement that it “encourages all to be respectful of the privacy and rights of the individuals involved.”  In the statement, the magazine also said, “It is natural and expected for a major news revelation such as this to spark debate and controversy” and said it was “committed to furthering that spirit of open discourse.” Ms. Goodman, in a phone interview, suggested that people would have to draw their own conclusions from the material she presented. “Everyone wants a smoking gun,” she said.  Later she added, “If people are like ‘I want more, that is not enough,’ I don’t know what to say. I want more as well.” ",0.034681818181818175,0.027771612226157687
238,Bitcoin Funds Are Rare: They Sail Uncharted Waters,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/business/bitcoin-funds-are-rare-they-sail-uncharted-waters.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-07-13T21:20:01+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are on their way to being the next big thing or yesterday’s news. Their novelty makes it hard to tell which. For better or worse, funds are being introduced that let investors capture the rewards and risks available in cryptocurrencies. Most are listed on foreign markets or aimed at so-called accredited investors, those with high incomes or substantial wealth, although the funds often have minimum investments of as little as $10,000 to $25,000. Several firms have filed to sell specialty exchange-traded funds in the United States, but none have been approved yet. The Securities and Exchange Commission has cited “significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.” The fund manager Van Eck and the software developer SolidX asked the S.E.C. in early June for permission to offer an E.T.F. that addresses the agency’s concerns, partly by setting the share price so high, nearly $200,000, that small investors could not afford it. That request is still pending. If and when funds are listed, prospective shareholders should treat them with caution and skepticism, investment advisers and authorities on cryptocurrencies warn. Since its invention in 2009, Bitcoin has risen from pennies to about $6,400, and other cryptocurrencies have experienced astounding runs of their own. There are fascinating aspects to Bitcoin and its peers, especially the underlying blockchain technology, but prices have been driven to a large extent by hype and hope, and the gains could be reversed. “There is no intrinsic value to a Bitcoin,” said Lee McKnight, an associate professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. “The market is caught up in a frenzy for new technology.” One sign of the frenzy is in the trading price of Bitcoin Investment Trust, one of the funds for well-off investors. It has been 56 percent above the value of the portfolio’s assets this year on average, according to Morningstar, bid up by shareholders eager for access to the market when few other avenues exist. The premium, which was 45 percent on June 30, could fall sharply if other investment vehicles come along. “The challenge with cryptocurrency-oriented investing is it’s hard to gain exposure, as there are no U.S.-listed E.T.F.s,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA. “When the supply to gain exposure to Bitcoin grows via E.T.F. choices and better meets demand, the premium will narrow.” Just what the right prices are for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fund premiums aside, is hard to judge, Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, acknowledged. “The crypto ecosystem hasn’t evolved an agreed-upon framework to value crypto,” he said. Referring to extreme long-range valuation estimates floated for Bitcoin, he added, “Anyone who says they know it’s worth $10,000 or $20,000 or $1 million or $0 is wrong.” Mr. Hougan thinks there’s a reasonable chance that cryptocurrencies will become widespread alternative forms of money, much as gold may be considered today, putting a floor under prices. He cited the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies — the blockchain ledgers recording transactions exist in no one spot and under no one’s control — and their built-in digital scarcity. “It’s entirely feasible that a new store of value could emerge in the world,” he said. “I don’t think that concept began and ended with gold.” Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency but not the only one. There are roughly 1,600 of them, Mr. McKnight said, and, “Eighty percent are scams, or assets with no value in the long run.” The technologies embodied in these ventures will undoubtedly serve other purposes, he said. Blockchains — secure, time-stamped sets of digital records — are expected to be valuable tools in areas like supply chain management and banking that feature large amounts of information shared among multiple parties using varied data management systems. “There’s a mass of confusion between blockchain technology, which will have a big impact, and cryptocurrencies,” Mr. McKnight said. The former “is what investors should be looking at.” A mature business devoting large resources to blockchain projects is I.B.M. It has about 15 commercial ventures focused on supply-chain management, he said, and it has “purposely stayed away from cryptocurrencies.” Many professional investors find promise in the core blockchain technology, even as they scoff at the notion that it can be used to reinvent money. In a note to investors this year, Joe Davis, the head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, said he was “enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes Bitcoin possible.” But “as for Bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.” Even a believer in cryptocurrencies like Mr. Hougan said Bitcoin is inefficient, with “a slow, simple network” and limited programming capabilities. But he wouldn’t rule it out as a portfolio holding. Because its price movements are minimally correlated with those of conventional assets, adding a modest allocation to Bitcoin to a 60 percent stock-40 percent bond portfolio could improve performance, he said. A study by Bitwise found that a 5 percent allocation would have doubled the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, of such a portfolio between the end of 2013 and the end of March. Because Bitcoin is so volatile, however, rebalancing the allocation is essential, Mr. Hougan added. If the desired weighting is 1 percent, he would sell back to that level whenever it reached 1.5 percent and buy more when it reached 0.5 percent. The value of a Bitcoin rose to just under $7,000 from about $600 during the time of the study. Whether owning it or other cryptocurrencies will be as helpful if the price persistently falls remains to be seen. Mr. McKnight is skeptical. “It’s buyer beware,” he said. “Don’t go into this space saying you’re going to pick this or that cryptocurrency without knowing anything. And you should not be using your living money.”",0.1753541666666667,0.03466155227873977

Could he in fact be a model-train fanatic living with his mother in a modest house in Southern California? That, at least, was what Newsweek, with a newly revived print version, reported on Thursday. But the man the magazine claimed to be behind the Bitcoin curtain has a similar name — Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto — which raised questions about why he had not been discovered sooner. Many digital currency aficionados said they doubted the veracity of the report.

240,Japan Won’t Impose Banking Laws on Bitcoin,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/japan-wont-impose-banking-laws-on-bitcoins/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-07T04:57:15+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"TOKYO — Bitcoin trading platforms can, for now, operate freely under Japanese law, the government said Friday in a note that signaled a hands-off approach to the virtual currency. In fact, Bitcoin is not a currency at all and is not subject to Japan’s stringent banking laws, officials said in a six-page paper that highlighted uncertainties more than clarifying the issues surrounding the digital payment system. The paper did confirm that transactions using Bitcoin are not considered banking and that an exchange trading them does not need to obtain a banking license or to meet compliance standards that such a license would require.  But the status of Bitcoin also makes it off-limits for Japanese banks, seemingly leaving the handling of them up to unregulated operators like Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection last week after losing half a billion dollars’ worth of its customers’ Bitcoin. Like any other commodity, however, Bitcoin is subject to taxes in Japan, the paper said. It left unclear whether the simple purchase of Bitcoins would be subject to Japan’s 5 percent sales tax, which is set to rise to 8 percent in April. Toshinori Matsushio, an official at the National Tax Agency, said that Bitcoin purchases were likely to be slapped with the sales tax unless they were singled out for exemption, much as postage stamps are in Japan. It would also be virtually impossible for the government to levy taxes on peer-to-peer sales. In this regard, Japan’s regulatory approach seemed to differ from that taken by other countries. According to a statement this week by the UK Digital Currency Association, British revenue and customs officials are set to announce that virtual currencies should be treated almost identically to other currencies in terms of taxation. That would mean no sales tax would be levied on Bitcoin sales and transactions. Still, the paper stressed that discussions would continue on the details of how Bitcoin would be taxed, as well as the need for more regulation to better protect Bitcoin users. Japan “has not yet grasped a complete picture” of Bitcoin, the paper said, and various government agencies are still “collecting information.” Now that Bitcoin has been deemed beyond the limits of Japan’s financial regulator, basic oversight and the drafting of more detailed guidelines could be left to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or the consumer protection agency. In a news conference, the top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said investigations of the Mt. Gox collapse could make it necessary for the government to review or revise its response. When asked to clarify how Bitcoin might be taxed, Mr. Suga gave no details. “Of course, the Finance Ministry would be thinking of various ways to tax it,” he said. The government prepared its note in response to questions submitted to Parliament by an opposition lawmaker, Tsutomu Okubo, a former managing director for Morgan Stanley. The cabinet approved the paper Friday morning. Colin Moreshead contributed reporting from Tokyo.",0.03753181818181819,0.015205627705627701
241,Bitcoin’s Mysterious Creator Is Said to Be Identified,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/newsweek-unmasks-bitcoin-founder-stirring-ire/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-03-06T20:51:28+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," Central to its cachet has been the mythic status of the system’s creator. Its developer went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, but that is all that Bitcoin’s adopters seemed to know — or wanted to know. After all, Bitcoin was a project dedicated in part to making it easier to avoid the all-seeing gaze of the government and corporate America. But the inventor of the virtual currency may not be quite the international man of mystery that some aficionados imagined him to be. Could he in fact be a model-train fanatic living with his mother in a modest house in Southern California? That, at least, was what Newsweek, with a newly revived print version, reported on Thursday. But the man the magazine claimed to be behind the Bitcoin curtain has a similar name — Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto — which raised questions about why he had not been discovered sooner. Many digital currency aficionados said they doubted the veracity of the report. The Mr. Nakamoto identified in the article denied involvement in Bitcoin on Thursday after a car chase involving a crowd of reporters. He told The Associated Press that he had not heard of the virtual currency until his son told him about being contacted by a reporter three weeks ago. On Thursday evening, an online Bitcoin forum account long believed to belong to the real Satoshi Nakamoto posted a one-sentence denial that he was the man identified in California. It was the account’s first activity in more than three years. If the identification is wrong, it would not be the first time that a reporter had incorrectly determined the identity of Bitcoin’s creator. Yet even if the report proves correct, virtual currency proponents at Bitcoin conferences in Texas and Barbados said that identifying Mr. Nakamoto would be a violation of the privacy the currency was intended to protect. Whatever the conclusion, the furor on Thursday laid bare just how far Bitcoin had moved beyond its humble origins five years ago — and just how much it still relied on the mystique of those beginnings. “In reality, a lot of people didn’t want to know,” said Arianna Simpson, a Bitcoin entrepreneur. “Not knowing and thinking that maybe it had been a community project, again, I think was very well tied to the essence of Bitcoin. To have it exposed in this way I don’t think does anybody a particular service.” For Mr. Nakamoto, Newsweek’s outing was clearly an unwelcome event. On Thursday, a team of journalists was camped outside his house in Temple City, Calif. When a reporter knocked on his front door, an older woman answered, but Mr. Nakamoto quickly came to shut the door, shouting, “No, no, no,” as he did. If Mr. Nakamoto, 64, is Bitcoin’s creator, he is thought to own hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the digital money. Because Bitcoin are generally stored on computer hard drives, many Bitcoin users say that Mr. Nakamoto has been made into a target for criminals who might look to steal his coins. The magazine’s report comes at a turning point for the Bitcoin industry. Last week, the virtual currency world was rattled by the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the dominant exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin. The company filed for bankruptcy in Japan last Friday, claiming to have lost about 750,000 customer coins, or nearly $500 million. The bankruptcy sent users scrambling to figure out where their money had gone, and it prompted renewed calls from lawmakers and others to increase government oversight of an industry that has no official regulator. The Newsweek article did not do any immediate damage to the currency itself. The price of a Bitcoin dipped a bit early on Thursday, but it recovered most of the losses, trading at around $650 by evening. Still, Bitcoin watchers said that the creator’s supposed anonymity had played a vital role in the growth of a virtual currency that has become a potent symbol for privacy advocates and critics of government power. “Having this level of mystery allowed people to project their optimism and their hopes onto the currency,” said Richard Peterson, the chief executive of MarketPsych, a research company that has studied virtual currencies. “If it’s true and people start to believe it, it undermines that mystique.” What is known for sure about the creator of Bitcoin is that the person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto posted a paper on an obscure mailing list in the fall of 2008 describing a new type of digital money. Bitcoin, as the creator called it, would be run according to a set of rules that would be downloaded on all the computers that joined in. One of the rules determined that only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created, through a process known as mining. In the months after the system went live, Satoshi Nakamoto emailed with his fellow collaborators but never gave any private details, and he refused to talk on the phone or meet in person. The only information came from a programming website, where a profile described him as a 38-year-old man in Japan. Mike Hearn, who became involved with Bitcoin a few months after it was created, said that initially, Bitcoin was too small and insignificant for the identity of its creator to be a concern. But as it grew, Mr. Hearn went back and looked at his emails with Satoshi Nakamoto and found that they had been sent through an encryption service that obscured their origin. Previous investigations by journalists have suggested that Satoshi Nakamoto might have been, variously, a young British banker, a Finnish programmer and an American law professor. But in each case, the people under suspicion have denied being Bitcoin’s creator. In the absence of any hard evidence, many Bitcoin users have built Satoshi Nakamoto into a sort of hero, imagining him as a selfless genius who created a system that would allow for greater economic freedom. The Mr. Nakamoto in Southern California confirms at least a part of that story. He is a physicist who graduated from California State Polytechnic University. A neighbor, Andrew Kent, said Mr. Nakamoto was “quiet and easygoing” and “clearly smart.” But given the sophistication of the original Bitcoin idea, some experts have doubted it could be the creation of one person, even a genius. At a conference on cryptography in Barbados on Thursday, many attendees discussed the evidence, or lack of evidence, linking Mr. Nakamoto with Bitcoin. “My personal opinion, I don’t think this is the right person,” said Stefano Zanero, assistant professor at the computer engineering department of Politecnico di Milano in Italy. “It just doesn’t add up, and quite honestly, I think that there were a lot of assumptions.” Social networks, meanwhile, compared the polished writing of Bitcoin’s creator with online writings apparently posted by Mr. Nakamoto, some of which were written in imperfect English. “I think it is very clear the writings are not made by the same person,” Roger Ver, a Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, said in an email. “I hope the real Satoshi is never found.” The real Satoshi Nakamoto could prove his or her identity fairly easily by making changes to an original Bitcoin account or by providing the security code that was attached to emails shared with a small group of Bitcoin’s earliest programmers. Proving someone is not Satoshi Nakamoto, however, is tougher. In Texas, at a Bitcoin conference that began on Wednesday, Brian Page, the director of communication for a company called Bitshares, said that initially, he was shocked by the apparent unmasking, but then he reflected. “I have no idea if it’s the guy or not, but it doesn’t matter,” he said. “He created something historic but it doesn’t matter if he is found. Bitcoin is launched and it’s not under his control or anyone’s control.” Quentin Hardy and Jenna Wortham contributed reporting.",0.0197359375,0.06135760506854256

So it appears the creator of Bitcoin may not have been a young Japanese mathematical wizard as had been long rumored. Instead, as Newsweek has first reported, he is believed to be a 64-year-old Japanese-American man named Satoshi Nakamoto who clearly does not care for attention. It is notable that the man Newsweek has identified as the creator of Bitcoin, has denied that he has anything to do with it. There is also — still — wide confusion about what Bitcoin is.  Bitcoin, an Internet-based cryptocurrency, has been in the news for months, of course. Conceptions of what Bitcoin actually is, however, still run from money to software to a network of diehard believers. The Bitcoin-like currencies like Auroracoin, Dogecoin or Unobtanium offer another perspective: More than anything, Bitcoin is a brand. On one level, Bitcoin is an open-source software protocol for creating an encrypted “currency,” against which people store value. That is partly to give users peace of mind, since it can be inspected for security or flaws and upgraded by its own users. Open-source code can also be copied and reconfigured, cheaply enough that you might consider making a coin for your sweetheart. “It takes about 20 minutes, and costs about $50,” said Brock Pierce, a Bitcoin entrepreneur and investor. “I’ve seen 275 logos of different coins. There’s probably thousands.” He was speaking at the Oasis conference in Los Angeles, where a crowd of traditional investors seemed generally warm to the new currencies. There is not a lot of financial risk here. The website Coinmarketcap keeps tabs on the 100 most valuable. The biggest is Bitcoin, with a total market capitalization of about $8.3 billion, or 70 percent of the $11.1 billion in total market cap of all 100 coins.  Ripple, the second largest (and a trading system not based on Bitcoin) is at $1.5 billion. The recent No. 100 on the list, Pandacoin, had a market cap of $88,537, or about twice what Arby’s paid for the hat that the singer Pharrell Williams wore at the Grammy awards in January. It should be noted that the recent fall of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, with losses of about $460 million, had much more to do with the lack of oversight at the exchange, and not with Bitcoin as a protocol.  Eric E. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, is one believer in the integrity of the Bitcoin software. “I had a look at the code,” he said. “It’s very good. Very sound.” Several of the new “–coins” themselves are gimmicky. Auroracoin promises to give coins to every citizen of Iceland, and recently had the fourth-largest market cap, at $367 million. Dogecoin is named for the lovable Internet meme. Unobtanium is named after the preposterous anti-gravitational mineral in the movie “Avatar.”  It pains some Bitcoin fans. “Early on, I thought, ‘Oh God — fragmentation,’” Mr. Pierce said. “It’s inevitable.” Now he’s decided that it’s a good thing. Lots of people are trying out different styles of money, until the world finds one it loves. Which shows how Bitcoin’s fate is tied to its brand: The network of users is also a network of believers, who are moved to use one of these protocols over another as a currency. And if the brand falters, Bitcoin will be sold off. To that end, Bitcoin’s fast recovery from the Mt. Gox collapse is a positive for the brand. It could be argued that paper money is a country’s brand, as well, except traditional money comes with hard rules and enforced regulations that tend to overpower emotional claims. Dogecoin, which became big in part because that doggie is just so cute, cannot quite make the same claim. In open-source software, continuous tweaks to existing code, to the point of making the end product altogether different, is known as “forking.” It is considered bad, since it makes it hard to build a standard.  The continual churn of currencies, and the promiscuous use of the protocol, make some people suspicious of how well Bitcoin and its kin will endure.  “I used to do security for a lot of three-letter agencies, and I don’t think Bitcoin has really been through a thorough security check,” said Alex Payne, co-founder and former chief technical officer of Simple, an online bank that last month was sold to BBVA for $117 million. “A cryptocurrency that the world uses for the next 50 years will have to get audits from regulators, universities, places the entrepreneurs of these currencies like to ridicule,” he added.",0.11674090909090908,0.11808740817263544

Some say there was outright theft. Others suspect fraud. Many blame lax controls, poor oversight and, above all, a reckless, globe-spanning, Wild West culture — a culture that everyone agrees is ripe for wholesale reform. I’m not talking about Bitcoin. I’m talking about Citigroup, which disclosed last week that its Mexican banking unit lost $400 million in a contracting swindle involving a shaky oil services company.

When scandal engulfs traditional financial institutions like Citigroup, there are investigations and calls for greater oversight — human oversight. Bitcoin, though, was born of mistrust of humans and their institutions. It rests on the belief that financial safety emerges from the integrity of the technology, a computer code that controls a payment system, rather than the trustworthiness of the humans who participate in it. To save their nascent currency, Bitcoin’s backers may be forced to alter their philosophy and embrace the same messy humans — auditors, insurers and even regulators — that the currency’s most ardent supporters have long abhorred. This raises two difficult questions: Can human oversight integrate into Bitcoin’s free-for-all ethos quickly enough to render Bitcoin safe? And, can Bitcoin be made safer without tamping down on the very openness that proponents say makes Bitcoin such a cheap, efficient and innovative financial platform? At the moment, the answers are still very much up in the air. Some in the more mainstream part of the Bitcoin world — firms that have sought venture capital and are trying to appeal to ordinary investors and large businesses — say they’re up to the challenge. They are working to set up stringent technical and financial audits of trading sites, and to create insurance mechanisms so that holders of Bitcoin won’t be wiped out by catastrophic losses like the one at Mt. Gox. There are even efforts to pursue government oversight. “We are reaching out to regulators, because we do want Bitcoin to be a regulated industry,” said Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, a site that allows people to purchase, store and trade with Bitcoin and that has received investments from some of Silicon Valley’s leading venture firms. He said he had met with state and federal regulators to discuss Bitcoin. “Even if everybody in Bitcoin doesn’t believe in regulation, we think it’s one way to help Bitcoin grow up and have more transactions flow over the network.” The most straightforward way of improving the safety of Bitcoin is also the most obvious: running independent audits of sites. Mt. Gox, which acted as a Bitcoin exchange site as well as a “wallet” that stored people’s coins, never once offered a public accounting showing it possessed all the funds it claimed to be storing, nor showing the technical methods it was using to safeguard those funds. The site’s opacity will make investigating its loss more difficult. Theories about how Mt. Gox really lost all that money, and who has it now, have consumed Bitcoin discussion sites for much of the last week. Mt. Gox has said it was hacked over a period of years, apparently through a well-known but minor flaw in Bitcoin known as “transaction malleability.” The flaw allows hackers to alter a Bitcoin payment while it’s in progress, potentially confusing a trading site into issuing a double payment. But in the absence of an audit trail, many in the Bitcoin world have trouble believing the hacking claim. On the other hand, every other leading theory for how Mt. Gox might have lost a half-billion dollars — whether government theft or cryptographic error — has been debunked, too. It’s possible that we’ll never really know what happened to that half-billion dollars. It has simply vanished. Mr. Armstrong said that to prevent something similar from ever happening at Coinbase, the firm plans to hire independent auditors to conduct a public investigation of both its Bitcoin and dollar holdings. The site also recently published a “security audit” of its technical processes, which showed it did live up to its claim of storing most of its Bitcoin holdings in “cold storage,” meaning on machines that are not connected to the Internet. Then there are more far-reaching efforts to secure Bitcoin. Elliptic, a British Bitcoin storage site, offers optional insurance on your holdings. For a fee of about 2 percent of your coins per year, the site promises to repay you if theft or negligence results in the loss of your funds. Another firm, Inscrypto, is working on what it calls a “decentralized version of the F.D.I.C.,” a system similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects your checking account. The system, which is still a work in progress, is far more complex than traditional deposit insurance, using derivative trades to protect against price swings or other dangers of Bitcoin. At the moment, it’s unclear how much it will cost, or even if it will work. The company, like several others in the Bitcoin world, declined to be quoted on the topic. To some supporters of Bitcoin, the rise of these consumer protection ideas is itself proof of the digital currency’s superiority over old-fashioned currency. One of Bitcoin’s most cherished technical tenets is openness, the idea that anyone, anywhere, can set up a trading node on the payment network. Openness lowers barriers to entry; it allows sites with newer, safer, more innovative financial ideas to easily peddle their wares, while rickety concerns like Mt. Gox die under their own incompetence. It sets up a Darwinian race toward a safer Bitcoin. In the short run, this dynamic causes terrible consequences for users, but eventually, Bitcoin’s supporters say, the worst problems will get ironed out. One frequent analogy in the Bitcoin world is to the early days of the Internet and web. Just a decade and a half ago, the web was a rough-and-tumble network ruled by pornography and illegal file-trading, a place where fraud flourished and danger lurked around every corner. Today the web is still all that, but it is also, in its more respectable corners, the place where you post pictures of your children, where you shop for Christmas presents, where you hold secure conversations with your doctor and where companies make billions of dollars every year without worry of being defrauded. “The history of Bitcoin is going to be largely the same,” Mr. Armstrong said. It starts with a “fundamental breakthrough that lowered the cost of payments, but there will be a lot of details to get right, and like on the early Internet, it will take time for the fundamental infrastructure to get established.” Once that happens, Mr. Armstrong says he believes that digital currencies will be unstoppable. Unless, of course, the thought of a half-billion dollars disappearing without a trace makes people queasy enough to stay away from Bitcoin for good.",0.01990508474576271,0.05688745811627168

A new so-called blockchain company is selling virtual real estate online with prices as high as $120,000 for a 10-meter by 10-meter piece of virtual land. You can buy a plot of virtual land in a virtual city, with certain neighborhoods costing more than others, like in a real city. Except that it isn’t a real city. It is all virtual. Follow? Me neither. Somehow this company, Decentraland, managed to raise $26 million in 30 seconds from investors last year. That money isn’t “virtual” — it is real. Welcome to the world of blockchain, the latest technological revolution to those in-the-know — and what seems like the latest get-rich-quick gibberish to the average person. You’ve probably heard that the blockchain is a technology that is going to change the world — it is the backbone of Bitcoin, the now infamous cryptocurrency. You might even have heard someone trying to explain blockchain by describing it as a “trusted distributed ledger.” If you’re like most people, that’s when you stopped understanding — or even trying to understand — what this whole blockchain thing is all about. (Stick with me for a moment and I promise you’ll understand it very soon.) It all feels a bit like 1999, circa the dot-com bubble. In Cannes, France, just last week, at an annual gathering of advertisers, there was a “blockchain yacht” and a “blockchain villa.” In Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was a “blockchain lounge.” [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here’s what you need to know.] Meanwhile, Fortune 500 companies are investing billions in the blockchain. IBM has a whole division focused on blockchain, as do the consultancies Accenture and PwC. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, has dismissed Bitcoin, but says “the blockchain is real.” Silicon Valley venture capitalists have already sunk more than $1.3 billion into blockchain technology just this year. And just this week, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent technology firms founded, in part, by Marc Andreessen — who is credited with inventing the modern Web browser — announced a $300 million “crypto” fund to exclusively invest in blockchain technologies. “For those of us who have been involved in software for a long time, it feels like the early days of the internet, web 2.0, or smartphones all over again,” Mr. Andreessen and his colleagues said when introducing the fund. That explanation of where this new technology sits within history feels right: While prognosticators love to talk about crypto and blockchain as a bubble, it is likely just very early days. And while 1999 marked what seemed like a high point for the internet before a precipitous fall, it proved to only be the first stage of the internet’s ascendance. Yes, there were implosions like Pets.com, but there was also Amazon. And what was arguably considered wild overspending in the late 1990s on internet infrastructure and an assortment of experimental companies, ultimately set the foundation for the modern era we live in today. Think about blockchain like this: There will be huge failures and misspent money — and yes, scams (the Securities and Exchange Commission can hardly keep up with the number of fraudulent players out there), but a decade from now, when you look back at 2018, it’s more likely than not that blockchain will be embedded in our day-to-day lives in ways that, today, we can’t even imagine. “New models of computing have tended to emerge every 10 to 15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s,” Mr. Andreessen said. And now blockchain. The easiest and most basic way to think about the underlying technology is to think about a technology that keeps a master list of everyone who has ever interacted with it. It’s a bit of an oversimplification, but if you’ve ever used Google Docs and allowed others to share the document so they can make changes, the programs keep a list of all the changes that are made to the document and by whom. Blockchain does that but in an even more secure way so that every person who ever touches the document is trusted and everyone gets a copy of all the changes made so there is never a question about what happened along the way. There aren’t multiple copies of a document and different versions — there is only one trusted document and you can keep track of everything that’s ever happened to it. The blockchain is, of course, being used to create all sorts of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. But more important, it is touching all different industries. The advertising industry plans to use it to track its ads all over the internet; the music industry is planning to use it to track songs; banks and mortgage companies want to use it to track the deeds of homes and the complicated process of tracking all the documentation; shipping companies are investing in blockchain technology to track bills of lading, the pharmaceutical industry wants to use the technology to verify the drug supply chain. If it is successful, blockchain technology will bring a new level of enhanced trust to business and will also cut out the middlemen that have historically tracked — and profited — from the complexity of so many different systems trying to communicate with each other. That could lower prices for goods and services. At the same time, for all the promise of blockchain, there are real questions about whether it may be applied to solve problems that don’t exist. Databases already exist and, in certain cases, a centralized database might actually be preferable to the blockchain. The blockchain is ultimately about solving society’s ultimate challenge: trust. Or rather, lack of trust. Blockchain is about using technology to create a shared sense of trust by a group of disparate participants. The biggest question is whether the hundreds of projects like Decentraland, where individuals are using real money to buy virtual property, will end well or badly — and whether that experience will ultimately instill or undermine trust in this emerging technology.",0.24337560975609757,0.09491431738992716

Plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed a motion on Tuesday seeking a temporary injunction to keep Mr. Karpeles or his company from moving any money outside of the United States. They also want a full accounting of any assets Mt. Gox has left. Mr. Gox, a Japan-based virtual currency marketplace, filed for bankruptcy on Friday, and Mr. Karpeles said it had lost all 750,000 customer Bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of its own — or more than $450 million worth. Although the company has a subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, it’s unclear what accounts, if any, the company held in the United States. “There were weaknesses in the system,” Mr. Karpeles said during a news conference in Tokyo on Friday to discuss the bankruptcy. “I’m truly sorry to have caused inconvenience.” Mr. Karpeles has blamed the loss on hackers, but it’s not yet clear what happened to the money.  Gregory Greene, an Illinois man who claims to have eventually acquired more than $25,000 worth of Bitcoins on Mt. Gox, filed his class-action lawsuit on Thursday, three days after the company’s website went offline, charging “systematic misuse and misappropriation of its users’ property.” Mt. Gox halted all customer withdrawals in early February after months of technical glitches. Users had long complained that they could deposit money into their accounts, but often had trouble taking money out.  In a company crisis strategy document that leaked online last week, Mt. Gox said that its customer deposits had been stolen over years and “went unnoticed.” But lawyers for Mr. Greene say that Mt. Gox knew it was in trouble long before it went offline, and deliberately misled customers about what it was doing to fix its problems. A representative for Mt. Gox could not be reached for comment. In court documents, lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that Mt. Gox misled customers by promising quick and secure trading, and for giving the impression that it was busy trying to solve any glitches in the system.  “Defendants in this case have engaged in a series of deceptive and unfair practices designed to lull consumers into depositing and keeping their money on the exchange while Mt. Gox KK readied itself for bankruptcy,” the suit claims, referring to the Japanese entity.  Bitcoin, a virtual currency that isn’t backed by any central bank, first appeared in 2009. It appealed to technology buffs and anti-establishment libertarians, many of whom had grown frustrated with a global banking system that had crippled many of the world’s biggest economies. Users can buy or “unlock” Bitcoins by solving mathematical riddles. But Bitcoin is not regulated, leaving users few options when things go sour.  Mt. Gox was at one point the dominant online marketplace for buying, selling and storing Bitcoins, and its shuttering last week sent many users scrambling to figure out what could be done to recover their money. “The idea that they have no money is not credible,” said Jay Edelson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “They were taking deposits up until the day before they shut down.”",-0.06714285714285714,0.001031746031746032

The guidelines, which clarify how Bitcoin should be dealt with under Japanese law, come after the collapse of a prominent Bitcoin exchange last week. An opposition lawmaker had petitioned the government to clear up, among other issues, whether Bitcoin should be treated as a currency. Treating them as a currency could strengthen the case for regulation under more stringent banking or other laws. The Japanese government seems to be leaning toward treating Bitcoin as a general commodity, the Nikkei said. Any gains from trading Bitcoin in Japan are to be subject to local taxes, together with any purchases made with Bitcoin, the paper said. For companies, revenue from Bitcoin transactions would also be taxed. The guidelines being drafted would also bar banks and securities firms from handling Bitcoin, the Nikkei said. Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said that talks on Bitcoin guidelines were in progress but that details had not been set. A spokesman at Japan’s Financial Services Agency also said guidelines were being drawn up. “Various government agencies are doing their best to put the guidelines together,” Mr. Suga said. The government is required by Sunday to address a petition lodged by Tsutomu Okubo, a lawmaker in the opposition Democratic Party and a former managing director at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Okubo filed an open letter last week in Parliament, urging officials to clarify their stance on Bitcoin regulation. Nations have been grappling with how to regulate Bitcoin, a popular virtual currency traded on the web, free of central control. United States regulators have shown interest in setting ground rules for it. The regulatory scrutiny has come amid hacking attacks and scandals that have cast doubt on Bitcoin’s potential to become an alternative to fiat money. Flexcoin, an online bank specializing in Bitcoin, said on Tuesday that it was closing after hackers plundered its digital currency reserves. That heist totaled about $600,000 at the current average market price. In Japan, action has in part been prompted by the collapse of Mt. Gox, long a dominant trading platform for Bitcoin based in Tokyo. Mt. Gox abruptly halted all trading and filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost half a billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoins, leaving hundreds of thousands of users in the lurch. The proposed guidelines, however, could ease fears that had arisen among some technology start-ups that the Mt. Gox debacle, together with a string of other hacking attacks and scandals, would bring heavy regulations that would force small operators out. But by banning banks and brokerage firms from handling Bitcoin, Japan’s proposed regulations appear to swing in the opposite direction. Karl-Friedrich Lenz, a law professor at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, said that although the proposed guidelines would bring some welcome clarification, they could also leave Bitcoin trading to untested upstarts, with little additional protections for users. “If banks and securities firms can’t handle Bitcoins, Japanese consumers will be stuck with illegal shadow banks like Mt. Gox, and their risk will be much higher as a result,” he said in a note. Colin Moreshead and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.",0.040409677419354834,0.05512992831541218

The employee, Christopher Nadovich, director of laboratories at the electrical and computer engineering department at Lafayette College, owned a company that provided Silk Road with a backup server for its website, according to a previously undisclosed court filing in the two-year investigation.  On Sept. 9, three weeks before the United States authorities shut down Silk Road and arrested Ross William Ulbricht, the man they say founded the site, an F.B.I. agent served a search warrant on Mr. Nadovich’s company, JTAN.com. The warrant sought to preserve records of any transactions involving Silk Road’s customers and any private communications between sellers and buyers of drugs on the website.  The search warrant on JTAN and the company’s involvement in the Silk Road case had remained a secret until a few weeks ago. On Feb. 18, federal prosecutors asked a United States magistrate in federal court in Philadelphia to unseal the matter so authorities could begin providing Mr. Ulbricht’s lawyer with information to begin planning a legal defense. Silk Road’s website ran on an encrypted Internet network called Tor, which allowed it to remain hidden from general viewing. The website, which authorities have called an eBay for illegal drugs, ran off a server in a foreign country and a backup server provided by JTAN. The search warrant illustrates the appeal a company like JTAN has for any online business that desires anonymity and uses a digital currency like Bitcoin to preserve the privacy of its customers’ activities. In the search warrant, the federal authorities said that JTAN specialized in allowing “customers to lease servers through its service with complete anonymity.” The filing also said that JTAN never asked customers to verify their identities and permitted them “to pay anonymously through the use of Bitcoins.” Mr. Nadovich is not named in the warrant, but other public records identify him as the owner of JTAN, which lists an address in Easton, Pa., where Lafayette College is based. In the warrant, the company is listed as having an address in Sellersville, Pa., about 33 miles from Easton. Mr. Nadovich has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In an emailed response, he said, “I’m afraid that I don’t feel inclined to comment about Silk Road or any business decisions made by JTAN.” Just days after the F.B.I. served the search warrant on JTAN, Mr. Nadovich began taking steps to close parts of his business. In a Sept. 14 online notice to JTAN customers that still appears on the company’s website, Mr. Nadovich said he was terminating the firm’s “dedicated server” business. Mr. Nadovich gave no explanation but said “the business situation we find ourselves in does not allow continuing this service.” On Oct. 30, he posted another notice, telling JTAN customers the company was struggling financially and could file for bankruptcy protection in 2014. Mr. Nadovich said on Tuesday that JTAN was still in business. James Margolin, a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office is prosecuting Mr. Ulbricht, declined to comment. The name of the F.B.I. agent who signed the search warrant application was redacted by authorities to protect his identity. The search warrant reveals that JTAN potentially provided the authorities with a wealth of information about Silk Road and Mr. Ulbricht. The authorities said that Silk Road’s primary server would purge information every 60 days or so, but data on the backup server at JTAN was not regularly deleted or destroyed.  “I believe that this backup data will reflect the details of numerous narcotics transactions conducted through the Silk Road website and the use of Bitcoins to launder the proceeds from these transactions,” the unidentified F.B.I. agent said in the search warrant application. Federal prosecutors contend that in a little more than two years, Mr. Ulbricht, who is 29, built Silk Road into the go-to place in the dark corners of the Internet for buying drugs like cocaine, ecstasy and heroin and stolen credit card numbers. Authorities contend the website handled $1.2 billion in transactions, all in Bitcoin. Mr. Ulbricht pleaded not guilty on Feb. 7 to money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Federal prosecutors said they obtained roughly 10 terabytes of data from the servers they seized in addition to the laptop Mr. Ulbricht had with him when he was arrested by authorities on Oct. 1 at a public library in San Francisco. The government’s crackdown on Silk Road and the arrest of Mr. Ulbricht began a series of embarrassing episodes for Bitcoin and digital currency enthusiasts, who see it as an alternative to traditional currencies because it is not backed by any government and not subject to political control. Bitcoin proponents suffered another black eye last week when Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for converting dollars and other currencies into Bitcoin, filed for bankruptcy in Japan. The company collapsed after its owner, Mark Karpeles, said it had lost more than $450 million worth of Bitcoins, possibly as the result of an attack by computer hackers. But days later, it’s still not clear what happened to the roughly 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoins. In late January, another Bitcoin proponent, Charlie Shrem, was arrested by federal authorities and charged with helping a Florida man sell Bitcoin to people looking to buy drugs on Silk Road.",-0.03245818181818182,-0.029911616161616167

 Can nearly $450 million go missing without a crime taking place? That is only one of the questions stemming from the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox that present a host of challenges for governments worldwide that are struggling to regulate virtual currencies. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan after the disappearance of more than 744,000 Bitcoins owned by customers, along with 100,000 of its own. Unlike an ordinary robbery, this appears to be the work of hackers who exploited a weakness in the system for tracking Bitcoin transactions that allowed the currency to be diverted, perhaps over a few of years. The number taken amounts to about 6 percent of the total Bitcoins in circulation, raising serious questions about how any virtual currency can be made safe for consumers and investors.  For law enforcement, this is like any bank robbery that requires identifying the perpetrators. DealBook reported that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to Mt. Gox and other firms to gather information about how virtual currencies are transferred and converted into dollars. But unlike in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” none of the Mt. Gox thieves are looking back at the posse and asking “Who are those guys?” One of the appeals of Bitcoin is its anonymity, and trying to find those who stole something intended to be untraceable through computer hacking may well be impossible. So the losses from Mt. Gox are unlikely to be recovered.  The question becomes how governments will monitor transactions in virtual currencies to protect owners. Doing so may be even more difficult when one of the motivations for developing Bitcoin was to avoid any official involvement. Senator Joe Manchin III offered one approach in a letter sent last week to financial regulators, urging them “to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.” This is the same strategy taken by China, which prohibited its banks from trading in virtual currencies. Unfortunately, it is easier to call for a ban on virtual currencies than actually instituting one. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, responded to a question from Senator Manchin at a recent hearing that her agency “simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way.” So if there is going to be a push to restrict, or even ban, the use of virtual currencies, it will have to come from Congress. The history of laws created to impose onerous restrictions on popular goods is not positive. Prohibition failed in the 1920s, while the criminalization of marijuana and online gambling has started to crumble, so there is not much hope for blocking the use of virtual currencies. Those who lost Bitcoins held by Mt. Gox have turned to the courts, but the likelihood of securing a recovery looks small. A class-action lawsuit was filed in the Federal District Court in Chicago against the exchange, claiming a number of violations of Illinois law, including consumer protection and fraud. The problem is that Mt. Gox does not appear to have any assets, so individuals are unlikely to have any legal recourse for their losses.  On the flip side, the approach taken by supporters of Bitcoin to the collapse of Mt. Gox reflects Friedrich Nietzsche’s famous comment, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.” Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, plans to start a Bitcoin exchange that will be modeled after the New York Stock Exchange that can provide more reassurance to consumers. That approach may signal how governments will go about regulating virtual currencies by adapting the structure used for trading securities and commodities. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission already have in place extensive rules for how exchanges and dealers operate and, perhaps more important, record-keeping and capital requirements for those who will hold the property of others. Another possible avenue for regulation would be to fit virtual currency firms into the rules for trading regular currencies. The C.F.T.C. used authority provided by the Dodd-Frank Act to create a  regulated entity called a “retail foreign exchange dealer,” which is allowed to engage in retail transactions and could be expanded to cover Bitcoin trading. The record-keeping requirements for securities and commodities exchanges would be of great help to the law enforcement authorities, which rely on a paper trail to build cases involving theft, embezzlement and misappropriation. The demise of Mt. Gox shows how difficult it is to find something that exists only in cyberspace when there are inadequate records about who actually owned the property. To protect customers from a total loss, the government can also require an insurance program along the lines provided for bank and brokerage customers. Firms that hold virtual currency on behalf of customers could be required to pay into a fund to be used to reimburse at least part of the loss if another situation like the theft at Mt. Gox were to happen. Needless to say, advocates of Bitcoin who cherish its anonymity and freedom from governmental oversight will not take kindly to increased regulation, along with the costs that come with it. Losing $450 million with no realistic chance of finding the thieves will inevitably spur changes in the structure of the market for virtual currency. Mt. Gox will not kill Bitcoin, but it is pushing governments to take a more active role in overseeing how it is traded.",-0.04798604651162791,-0.0034425651867512354

The announcement came just days after a Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo. HM Revenue and Customs, the British tax agency, said on Monday that it would not charge a 20 percent tax, known as a value added tax, or VAT, on trades of the virtual currency. But, it added, taxes still must be collected on any purchases made using Bitcoin. “In all instances, VAT will be due in the normal way from suppliers of any goods or services sold in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrency,” the tax agency said.  VAT is charged on most business transactions in Britain and Europe, whether they are between businesses or companies selling to the public. VAT is similar to sales tax in the United States and is included in the price for products and services sold to the public, such as clothing or other merchandise. Last year, Britain said it considered Bitcoin a tradable voucher and that VAT could be charged on the value of the currency. Entrepreneurs in Britain had argued that such treatment put them at a disadvantage to other countries. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies “have a unique identity and cannot therefore be directly compared to any other form of investment activity or payment mechanism,” the tax agency said on Monday. In December, China barred the nation’s banks from accepting Bitcoin as a currency over concerns about potential money laundering and possible threats to financial stability.  The European Banking Authority has also warned consumers about the potential risks of using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, including losing money in the collapse of a Bitcoin exchange like Mt.

That was clear long before the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last week.  Bitcoin’s future is very much in doubt. Yet whatever becomes of it, something good can arise from its innovations — even if the results are very different from its current form or its numerous competitors. What I have in mind isn’t another wave of price speculation. Instead, I believe that electronic forms of money could give us better pricing, contracting and risk management. The Bitcoin phenomenon seems to fit the basic definition of a speculative bubble — that is, a special kind of fad, a mania for holding an asset in expectation of its appreciation. Further, a bubble is publicized and amplified by news of price increases, often justified by some kind of inspiring “new era” story that attracts more attention as the price rises. In this case, the narrative was that a computer whiz invented a new kind of money in the form of electronic currency units, as part of a decentralized computer-driven system for a world economy that extends beyond the reach of any single government.  The central problem with Bitcoin in its present form, though, is that it doesn’t really solve any sensible economic problem. Nor should it substitute for banks and the governmental institutions that regulate them. They are reasonably effective institutions, despite their flaws, and should not just be scrapped and replaced by a novel electronic system.  Unfortunately, the Bitcoin success story has been tied intrinsically with instability, with excitement and envy for those who have become rich through investing in it — rich for a while at least, because the value of the electronic currency has fluctuated wildly. The instability of Bitcoin’s value in dollars is a measure of failure, not success. It means that any commerce using Bitcoin or its competitors would be buffeted by enormous inflation and deflation.  But if we go back to the electronic-money drawing board, we may conclude that Bitcoin has been focused on the wrong classical functions of money, as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Bitcoin offers a way of “mining” electronic coins that can replace our dollar bills and bank accounts. Yet there is no fundamental need for this. Money, as we’ve known it for decades, works quite well in these respects. It would be much better to focus on another classical function: money as a unit of account — that is, as a basic standard of economic measurement. Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about ways to improve systems of measurement. Business people should, too.  This has already begun to happen. History shows that this unit-of-account function of money has been separated from the other two, and to good purpose. For example, since 1967 in Chile, an inflation-indexed unit of account called the unidad de fomento (U.F.), meaning unit of development, has been widely used. Financial exchanges are made in pesos, according to a U.F.-peso rate posted on the website valoruf.cl. One multiplies the U.F. price by the exchange rate to arrive at the amount owed today in pesos. In this way, it is natural and easy to set inflation-indexed prices, and Chile is much more effectively inflation-indexed than other countries are.  Consider rents. Increases may seem unfair to tenants, yet they may be needed to offset inflation. In Chile, a landlord can easily set the monthly rent for the tenant in U.F.s and then never have to change it, reducing the potential for errors, delays and misunderstandings. The name “U.F.” reframes people’s thinking so that keeping real economic values stable is natural and easy. With electronic software in the background, we can improve on the Chilean idea and make it more useful. First, we should use more evocative words and avoid jargon. I’d suggest calling the unit of account a “basket.” A basket is a simple description for something rather complicated. In its basic form, it is the equivalent of one day’s common consumption items, like the local marketbasket of typical purchases that already underlies the Consumer Price Index. The value from one base year would be chosen so that, with inflation, the price of a basket in local currency terms would rise.  A second improvement could be achieved by a credit card company or an entity like PayPal or Square Cash: Set up the electronic machinery to allow people to easily send conventional money, denominated in baskets, to anyone in the world. You would just check off a box indicating whether your payment was in dollars or pesos or euros — or baskets. If you check “baskets,” the computer would calculate the amount of local currency the recipient would need to buy that basket at that time, and it would transmit it, too.  A third improvement would be to move beyond just one new unit of account to a whole system of them, so that we could have baskets for different purposes. There should be senior baskets representing items consumed by older people in one day in a given country, as well as subsistence baskets representing the consumption of the poor. There should also be a day-wage unit of account representing a day’s work by an average unskilled wage earner. And there could be a “trills” unit — a concept that Mark Kamstra of York University and I have been advocating — that represents one trillionth of a country’s most recently estimated annual G.D.P. There should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. This could be used for pension and Social Security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: The idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. With many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term. These are ideas about simplification of complex economic calculations. But they are borrowed from behavioral economics, which has taught us that our actions are profoundly affected by framing — by the words we use and the approaches we take. And they are also ideas from cognitive linguistics, which implies that improved language, with new meanings for words like basket or day-wage, will change our thinking. I have been arguing for almost 20 years that we should not only copy the Chileans but also carry their ideas further into such improvements. All the recent interest in new electronic money could mean that now is the time to reconsider the foundation of our standards of value.  Bitcoin has been a bubble. But the legacy of the Bitcoin experience should be that we move toward a system of stable economic units of measurement — a system empowered by sophisticated mechanisms of electronic payment.",0.1896982142857143,0.07439806225520511

In the early 1970s, Hock created the credit card system that we now know as Visa. Hock was a man who liked to think grandiose thoughts. When it came to Visa, and credit cards in general, Hock used to describe them not just as a way to get a short-term loan but as a new kind of payment system, an exchange of value that was on par with, and that competed with, cash. As it turns out — and the bitcoin experience is helping to illustrate this — Hock’s description of credit cards was more than a little hyperbolic. Yes, you could now use a small plastic card instead of cash to buy something, but that card had value because it connected both the buyer and the seller to a fiat currency. People trusted it because they believed in their country’s currency and financial institutions. The exchange of value was never the credit card itself; it was still the dollar, the pound, the yen. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is truly a new form of payment system, unconnected to any currency or any government. Its libertarian proponents in Silicon Valley love that about it; they talk about it as a potential disrupter of traditional financial institutions. It has value not because a government has decreed and backed its value — the classic definition of a fiat currency — but because a community of users has decided to give it value. Its current travails, however, suggest that may also be its inherent flaw: that however much we say we mistrust governments and banks, when it comes to our money, we trust them a lot more than we trust some clever lines of computer code. The Internet, I should note, could really use a digital currency. For starters, it would make transactions on the web much easier while cutting down on the rampant credit card fraud and identity theft that exists online.  It is also true that there have been many unsuccessful attempts to create a digital currency. Bitcoin is by far the most ingenious attempt, and it solves numerous problems. It allows for anonymity, just like cash, while also rendering transactions public, which ensures against double spending (that is, using the same bitcoins for multiple transactions). It is virtually impossible to counterfeit. And, as Felix Salmon pointed out last year, “to all intents and purposes, bitcoins are invisible to law enforcement and the taxman.” But so far bitcoins have less resembled a currency than a commodity. Up until now, they have mostly been used for pure speculation. Indeed, because there are only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation, the speculative ride has been pretty wild. In February, the bitcoin dropped in value from around $880 to the mid-$5oos.Bitcoin’s gyrations hardly engender trust among potential users. And the recent bitcoin-related news isn’t exactly reassuring either. First, a well-known bitcoin entrepreneur was arrested for allegedly laundering criminals’ money on an underground website called Silk Road, which traffics in, among other things, illegal drugs. Then, Mt. Gox, the leading bitcoin exchange, went out of business — and nobody knows what happened to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins it was holding for customers. The country’s most prominent bitcoin backer, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, whose firm is funding bitcoin-related start-ups, raced to CNBC to claim that the Mt. Gox failure was just part of the growing pains for bitcoins. And maybe it is. But who in his right mind, whether merchant or customer, is going to engage in commerce with a currency so seemingly unstable, or one that can so quickly disappear? The great irony of bitcoin is that its anonymous creator (or creators), who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, believed that people would want his new currency because they had learned to mistrust financial institutions. As Salmon notes, when Nakamoto introduced bitcoin, in February 2009, he wrote:  “ ‘The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.’ ” All of which is true. But however angry we might be at bank compensation or at the role of financial institutions in the financial crisis, we still trust banks to safeguard our money, and we still trust government to back our currency. For bitcoin to succeed, it will have to embrace the one thing it was most intended to avoid: government. ",0.2953486486486487,0.08167765167765167

Fortress said it bought $20 million worth of Bitcoin in 2013, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. As of Dec. 31, that stake was worth less than $17 million. Executives at Fortress have expressed interest in Bitcoin for months, but it has been unclear just how the company might be involved with it. Ripple Labs, a budding online Bitcoin payment system, had disclosed an investment from Pantera Capital, which includes money from executives at Fortress. The Fortress filing on Thursday did not detail the exact nature of its virtual currency investment, and a spokesman for Fortress declined to comment. Bitcoin, which exists only as computer code, has thus far circumvented the traditional financial system. That has posed a challenge for regulators, which now face increased pressure in the wake of the collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the earliest and at one point largest Bitcoin exchanges. Fortress’s investment in Bitcoin represents a tiny fraction, less than 1 percent, of a balance sheet valued at $2.6 billion at the end of 2013. But its stake could encourage interest in an industry that has not yet gained a foothold with Wall Street or the general economy. “This makes it more legitimate for the hedge funds to buy, and easier, and provide the path for any other public company to report it,” said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities.  “Now, there’s a blueprint for how to go through reporting ownership of Bitcoin in a public S.E.C. filing.” Banks have largely shied away from Bitcoin because of its volatility and lack of regulation. That has fueled Bitcoin’s instability, and the price has fluctuated wildly since the currency was introduced in 2009. But venture capital firms and other established entrepreneurs have begun to back new Bitcoin companies with more sophisticated infrastructure and technology. That’s fueled some hopes that Bitcoin could gain more of a foothold in the mainstream. “I think the question now is whether they’re going to market this as a product to their investors,” Mr. Luria said of Fortress’s investment. “I think that would be the next step I would expect from them.”",0.11871428571428573,0.09545969903112758

Explaining the Tech Behind Cryptocurrencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-28T00:54:37+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A blockchain is a relatively new kind of database that has become the trendy solution for storing digital information more securely. The International Data Corporation recently forecast that companies and governments will spend $2.1 billion on blockchains in 2018, more than double what was spent last year. But if you ask even the people who work with blockchains to define the technology, you are likely to get a stuttering response. Don’t blockchains have something to do with Bitcoin? Indeed. The first blockchain was the database on which every Bitcoin transaction was stored. Since Bitcoin began in 2009, the blockchain has come to hold over 160 gigabytes worth of data about every time a Bitcoin is sent between two digital wallets. Why is it called a blockchain?  In the original documents describing Bitcoin, the virtual currency’s new database was not referred to as a blockchain. But it got that name over time because all of the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. That makes it hard to go back and rewrite or monkey with the older records. Academics have pointed out that this design existed before Bitcoin, but Bitcoin brought it to prominence. How is the blockchain different than other databases used to store transactions? Most databases used to keep financial records are maintained by a central institution. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is responsible for keeping track of how much money is in all of its customers’ accounts. With Bitcoin’s blockchain database, the ledger is kept and updated communally by all the computers that are hooked into the Bitcoin network. The communally maintained nature of the Bitcoin blockchain has brought it comparisons with Wikipedia, which relies on a broad network of contributors rather than one author. The shared nature of the Bitcoin blockchain was useful for the virtual currency because the shadowy creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted to create a currency with no central authority involved. Because the records are kept communally, no one computer or institution is in charge. If any one computer keeping the records is hacked or knocked offline, the other computers can go on without it. Are all the blockchain projects tied to Bitcoin in some way? No. Most blockchains have nothing to do with Bitcoin. After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years — successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers — many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if the design of the Bitcoin blockchain might be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers, unrelated to Bitcoin. Are blockchains used only for recording virtual currency transactions? No. Most of the early efforts to imitate the Bitcoin blockchain were done by programmers looking to create virtual currencies with slightly different characteristics from Bitcoin, and that needed their own databases to store all the transactions. Over time, some of these new virtual currencies added on significant new features that updated the blockchain concept so that it could handle more kinds of information. The most valuable virtual currency other than Bitcoin is Ether, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition to recording virtual currency transactions, the Ethereum blockchain can record and execute simple programs. It is possible, for instance, to create a program on the Ethereum blockchain that will move Ether between wallets only after a specific event. More recently, many companies and governments have been interested in using blockchains to store data that has nothing to do with virtual currency transactions, or transactions of any sort. While banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts, governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes. Why is this unusual way of storing data something that companies are excited about? There are several limitations that come with the old way of keeping data, with a single authority responsible for all the updates. When a database is maintained by a single authority, if that authority gets compromised by a hacker, or even by natural disaster, the people relying on that database can lose access to all their data. With a blockchain, all the people relying on the database can keep and update their own copy of the data. Apart from the security, a lot of data is kept in a way that requires all the players to separately keep track of the records themselves. Banks, for instance, keep track of every transaction they do with other banks, even though the other banks are also keeping track of the same records. It costs a lot to make sure everyone’s records are in sync. Blockchains can potentially provide a more efficient way to do this so that everyone is always on the same page. If blockchains involve multiple computers all keeping track of data, what if they disagree?  This issue, of how to keep everyone on the same page, is what the most important, but also the most confusing, bits of blockchain technology are aimed at resolving. In Bitcoin, the process of mining, or creating new Bitcoin, also has a second purpose of making sure everyone is making the same updates to their copy of the blockchain. Most virtual currencies have used this process to coordinate everyone on the blockchain. When blockchains don’t have a virtual currency, they have to find a different mechanism to get everyone to agree on new additions to the ledger. These mechanisms are called consensus algorithms, and they are among the most contentious pieces of blockchain design. Can anyone join any blockchain and help update the records? With most large virtual currencies, anyone can join in and see and help maintain the records. These are called public blockchains. This system has made many big players looking at the technology uncomfortable. Consequently, most corporations and governments have worked with so-called private blockchains, which only approved computers can see and join. Haven’t all the thefts involving Bitcoin shown that blockchains aren’t secure? Most of the thefts involving virtual currencies are a result of people’s having the password, or private key, to a virtual currency wallet stolen or hacked. Virtual currencies are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because once a hacker moves money out of a wallet, there is no central authority to move it back. Any blockchain wallet or account is generally only as secure as its private key. While private keys are a security vulnerability, blockchains are generally more secure against attacks in which a bad actor tries to change the records in the database. Because of the way blocks are chained together, it is obvious when someone has tampered with old records. Do we know if blockchains really are better than old ways of recording data?  We don’t, really. Virtual currencies have shown that blockchains can work at some level, but they also come with significant downsides. Because all the computers on the network have to record every transaction, there are limits to how much data blockchains have been able to process. There are many efforts to fix this, but none have been proven to work. Many critics of the blockchain design have said the inefficiencies in keeping data communally are likely to make blockchains unattractive except in cases where centrally kept databases are a major liability. At this point, aside from the big virtual currencies, few blockchains have been used and battle tested in the real world for any amount of time, which leaves significant questions about how they will perform once they make it into use.",0.07610727272727273,0.16918658992522628

Gox,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/mt-gox-files-for-bankruptcy/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-02-28T11:45:32+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"As the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was careening toward collapse in early February, its owner, Mark Karpeles, found that even some of his fellow virtual currency advocates were losing faith. Members of the Bitcoin Foundation’s board, an important promoter of virtual currencies, were losing confidence because the exchange had been associated with another foundation member who was arrested in January on money-laundering charges. The young currency in recent months had been increasingly backed by prominent investors, but the taint of any criminal activity was starting to take over the headlines. Some wanted Mr. Karpeles, chief executive of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based site that once had been the favored place to buy Bitcoins, to either resign from the foundation or be removed from its board, said people briefed on the matter. It was that steady erosion of faith in the Bitcoin community that ultimately served as the death knell for Mt. Gox, which had been enduring a series of problems, including having accounts frozen by authorities in the United States last year. Without the public backing of Bitcoin believers, Mt. Gox lacked the ability to get the financing it needed, those with knowledge of the discussions say. On Friday, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection, five days after Mr. Karpeles resigned from the foundation and just days after its website suddenly went dark. The exchange said that most likely it had lost 750,000 of its customers’ Bitcoin holdings and more than 100,000 of its own coins, or more than $450 million worth. At a news conference in Tokyo, Mr. Karpeles, dressed in a suit instead of his usual T-shirt, bowed in contrition and apologized in Japanese. “There were weaknesses in the system,” he said. “I’m truly sorry to have caused inconvenience.” It is not clear how much lasting damage the collapse of Mt. Gox will do to the push by venture capitalists and wealthy investors to turn Bitcoin and other digital currencies into a viable alternative to traditional currencies like the United States dollar and the euro. Digital currency advocates say other exchanges were quickly supplanting Mt. Gox as the place for people to convert traditional currencies into Bitcoin, and the impact will be short-lived. But American prosecutors are stepping up their inquiries. Prosecutors in the United States have issued subpoenas to several other related companies, including Mt. Gox and the Internet Credit Union, a credit union based in New Brunswick, N.J., and one in Japan, said several other people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors hope to better understand how money is transferred in the digital realm and converted from dollars to Bitcoin. The people briefed on the matter said they would not be surprised if authorities subpoena other companies and institutions involved in money transfers. Many of Mt. Gox’s woes came shortly after Charlie Shrem, another pioneer in the world of virtual currencies, was arrested by American authorities in New York on money-laundering charges on Jan. 26. He has also since resigned. Mr. Shrem’s arrest set off alarm bells at the foundation not only because he was a board member, but because the criminal complaint against him said his co-conspirator had used a “third-party Bitcoin exchange service based in Japan” to park his money. The clear reference to Mt. Gox unnerved the Bitcoin Foundation’s other members, even though prosecutors did not claim any wrongdoing by either Mt. Gox or Mr. Karpeles. For the foundation, which is dedicated to promoting the legitimate uses of Bitcoin and combating its popular image as a plaything for the rich or as a vehicle for online drug dealers to launder money, it potentially was too much of a public relations hit for both Mr. Shrem and Mr. Karpeles to remain on the board. The case against Mr. Shrem, the 24-year-old chief executive of BitInstant, another Bitcoin exchange business, appears to grow out of the investigation into the now-defunct Silk Road, a virtual one-stop market for illegal drugs. His co-defendant, Robert Faiella, used Mr. Shrem’s company to sell Bitcoin to Silk Road customers, some of whom used the electronic money to buy illegal drugs. Authorities said Mr. Shrem’s company funneled more than a million dollars in Bitcoin to an account Mr. Faiella had at Mt. Gox to further the scheme, according to the complaint and people briefed on the matter. The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has been particularly active in cracking down on the illegal use of digital currencies, which exist in an unregulated marketplace. Last year his office indicted the operators of Liberty Reserve, a firm that used its own digital currency to facilitate money laundering for online criminals, and the operators of the Silk Road. James Margolin, a spokesman for Mr. Bharara, declined to comment on the prosecutor’s Bitcoin crackdown. Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Shrem, said his client intended to plead not guilty to the charges. Mr. Shrem, who lives in New York and is also a part owner of Manhattan bar that allows patrons to pay in Bitcoin, remains one of the more vocal proponents of digital currencies even after his arrest. In conversations conducted on the phone and over email he defended Mr. Karpeles, whom he called a friend, and said any suggestion that Mr. Karpeles did anything wrong is “preposterous.” He said it was unfortunate that the foundation’s other board members began to single out Mr. Karpeles. “Mark had relayed to me that he’s kind of frustrated with the Bitcoin community,” said Mr. Shrem. “He’s frustrated with this whole thing.” Over the last few weeks, Mr. Karpeles had been seeking additional financing. Last Saturday, Mr. Karpeles and a few of his close associates met to discuss a strategy to keep Mt. Gox operating. They put together a proposal and approached a small number of potential white knights, including Barry Silbert, chief executive of SecondMarket, and the Winklevoss twins, a person briefed on the discussions said. But before those talks could progress, the proposal was leaked on the Internet and rumors of Mt. Gox’s troubles scuttled any potential rescue. “They were trying to come up with a solution,” said Roger Ver, a 35-year-old technology entrepreneur who was present at one of the meetings. Mr. Ver has been working closely with the company and said he had up to 24,000 coins in the exchange when it went offline. Mt. Gox then began warning other major Bitcoin exchanges that it was in trouble, and that its trading would soon stop temporarily, the person said. Once Mt. Gox went dark, it never opened for business again. Bitcoin prices had briefly tumbled after the site went dark, but have since recovered. On Friday Bitcoin was trading at $539, according to the website Coindesk. Still, Bitcoin investors are left to figure out what, if any, recourse they have against their losses at Mt. Gox. At least one class-action lawsuit has already been filed. “I don’t think people are going to get their money back,” Mr. Ver said. Mr. Karpeles, known in the close-knit Bitcoin sector as reclusive, purchased Mt. Gox from its founder, Jed McCaleb, in 2011. Within two years, Mr. Karpeles helped transform it into an exchange that at one point handled 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. But Mt. Gox’s recent problems may have been taking a toll on Mr. Karpeles, who never seemed quite suited for the spotlight. It was Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, described as Mr. Karpeles’ right-hand man, who would represent him in meetings with the Bitcoin Foundation, according to people familiar with the meetings. Even before problems surfaced at Mt. Gox, Mr. Karpeles rarely socialized with colleagues and worked constantly both at home and at work, according to one business associate who did not want to be identified for fear of compromising his relationship with Mr. Karpeles. Tang Shunping, who runs an import-export business in Tokyo, said that he was trying to retrieve about 100 coins from Mt. Gox. Mr. Tang may have been among the last people to buy Bitcoin from Mt. Gox before it shut down, placing an order for 300,000 yen’s worth of coins on Tuesday morning, according to his online bank statement. Less than an hour later, the site went blank. “I trusted Mt. Gox because it’s the biggest name out there, and because it’s based in Tokyo,” said Mr. Tang.",-0.049623364485981314,0.01075341195668298

Gox, a prominent trading platform for Bitcoin. In Tokyo, where Mt. Gox is based, Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said on Wednesday that agencies including the Financial Services Agency, the Finance Ministry and the police were collecting information on the Bitcoin trade in Japan, with an eye toward regulatory action. “Once we assess the situation, we will respond as necessary,” Mr. Suga told a news conference. “At the moment, we are still in the information-gathering stage.” Japan’s new interest in Bitcoin came as authorities elsewhere were taking steps. In the weeks before the collapse of Mt. Gox, federal prosecutors in Manhattan sent a grand jury subpoena to the company, according to people briefed on the matter. The prosecutors, who had already criminally charged the founder of a popular website where Bitcoins could be bought, have formed a broader partnership with the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies to crack down on companies using Bitcoin exchanges to filter tainted money and support drug trafficking. New York State’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, has also signaled an interest in regulating the virtual currency. And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is examining its potential authority over Bitcoin exchanges that have a United States presence, a person briefed on the matter said, as is the F.B.I. in New York. Mt. Gox — its name is derived from Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, showing its origins as a gaming platform — was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. It stopped trading on Monday after having halted user withdrawals earlier. An unverified document that circulated on the Internet Monday night pegged Mt. Gox’s losses at 744,000 Bitcoins, or 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins currently in circulation. Yet the shutdown has not curbed enthusiasm for the virtual currency. The price of Bitcoin rose about 8 percent on Wednesday, to $577, according to the virtual-currency monitoring site CoinDesk. Shortly before going offline, Bitcoins were trading on Mt. Gox at just over 20 percent of what they were selling for elsewhere. “There were a lot of people who were trying to buy Bitcoin at what appeared to be discounted prices,” said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. “A lot of the demand was going to Mt. Gox, and once Mt. Gox completely shut down, that level came back into all the other exchanges.” Another large Bitcoin exchange, BTC-e in Bulgaria, posted a notice on Tuesday saying that it would have to move to a new platform “in order to cope with an increased number of client requests.”  “It seems like it should be panic, but the reality on the ground is it’s really not,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder and president of Coinbase, which facilitates Bitcoin transactions. In a statement on Mt. Gox’s website on Wednesday, its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, said he was still in Japan and “working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.” He also said that Mt. Gox employees had been instructed not to give out any information and asked users to refrain from asking the staff questions. Like their counterparts elsewhere, Japanese authorities are heading into unfamiliar territory in regulating a virtual currency. A relatively easy regulatory change would be to bring Bitcoin under the purview of Japan’s Payment Services Act, which oversees electronic money, shopping points and escrow transactions. That could enforce new limits on Bitcoin transactions, including their size. While Bitcoin has faced relatively little scrutiny in Japan, it has invited comparisons to an infamous scandal involving Enten, an electronic currency used by a Tokyo company to defraud investors of billions of yen in the mid-2000s. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Attracted to the promise of lower transaction costs and a currency that could circumvent the traditional banking system, Bitcoin initially attracted a loyal following of technology aficionados, entrepreneurs and those with libertarian or anti-establishment leanings. Since then, more established players have come on board, including Marc Andreessen, who has invested in Coinbase, the brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who own about $64.1 million in Bitcoin, and Fred Wilson, a partner in the investment firm Union Square Ventures. All of those investors have voiced their support of Bitcoin in recent days. “I will happily retweet all retractions and apologies from people who wrongly forecasted death of Bitcoin as result of Mt. Gox collapse,” Mr. Andreessen posted on Twitter on Wednesday. Ben Protess and Zhiyi Yang contributed reporting.",0.10479761904761904,0.08122957588518813

 Hours after it stopped trading without warning Monday night, the secretive Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that it would “close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users.” The action and brief statement left users wondering where their money went, amid accusations that as much as 6 percent of the Bitcoins in circulation were now missing — worth more than $300 million at current exchange rates. Outside the offices of Mt. Gox in central Tokyo, disgruntled Bitcoin traders and their supporters held up signs that read “Where Are My Bitcoins?” “I’m filled with disbelief,” said Kolin Burges, a trader from London who flew to Japan this month after the exchange stopped paying out funds. “I was prepared for the worst, but it’s hard to believe they might have lost their coins.” Yet the unanswered questions about Mt Gox did not shake the faith of many in Bitcoin. With one of its earliest online marketplaces seemingly gone, the world of virtual currency may now be forced to become a more mature part of the financial system. “I think it’s a significant event, but I think there’s a decent chance that it is part of what we would call this sort of shaking out of the industry as it matures and slowly becomes a little more regulated,” said Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York state’s top financial regulator. Mr. Lawsky is not the only regulator trying to determine the next steps. Three commissioners from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were at a meeting recently where Bitcoin was on the agenda, and the agency’s lawyers are examining the regulators’ options, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Federal prosecutors in New York also are investigating potential legal violations that arise from use of the virtual currency.   Financial regulators around the world have weighed in over the last few months on how to oversee Bitcoin, with some countries, like Russia, banning it altogether, and others, like Germany, generally favoring the new technology. The interest in Bitcoin is that its underlying technology holds the promise of allowing users to move money around the world without using an intermediary, thus lowering the cost of financial transactions. Troubles at Mt. Gox have rattled the Bitcoin world before. A year ago, the exchange suspended operations for several hours, and Bitcoin trading nearly ground to a halt. But since then some prominent venture capitalists have invested millions in new Bitcoin companies that are intended to provide more sophisticated platforms for virtual currency transactions. Many of those investors went public on Tuesday to declare their continued confidence in the technology. Cameron Winklevoss, an early Bitcoin proponent who, along with his brother, Tyler, owns about $64.1 million worth of the virtual currency, said that Mt Gox’s closure “underscores just how far the Bitcoin ecosystem has come.” “Several exchanges have seamlessly picked up the slack and the market price has shown remarkable resilience,” Mr. Winklevoss said in an email. “Mt. Gox is in the past, and the brightest minds in the room are hard at work building a responsible and secure future.” Such optimism was reflected in the oft-volatile price of Bitcoin, which rose on Tuesday after plummeting overnight. Tuesday evening, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $525, not far from where it was when the Mt. Gox news emerged Monday night. “There’s a little bit of a sense of relief that the whole thing didn’t crumble,” said Gil Luria, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, who has written research notes on Bitcoins. “Over the next few weeks and months, we’re going to see new exchanges either gain prominence or emerge.” Many users of Mt. Gox had long ago given up on the company after numerous incidents in which it was forced to temporarily shut down. At one point last year, Mt. Gox handled 80 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. But the exchange’s market share began to significantly decline last year, when newer exchanges like Bitstamp in Slovenia, and BTC-e in Bulgaria, took its place, according to data from the Genesis Block, a virtual currency research firm. A number of other early Bitcoin companies have also struggled recently. A few weeks before the problems at Mt. Gox, the founder of the popular early exchange BitInstant, Charles Shrem, was arrested and accused of helping to facilitate drug transactions on the now-defunct online marketplace Silk Road. “There’s definitely been a clear transition happening,” said Greg Schvey, the Genesis Block’s head of research. Among the new, more experienced companies entering the space is SecondMarket, which runs an exchange for the buying and selling shares of private companies. On Monday, as Mt. Gox was preparing to go offline, SecondMarket announced its plans to start a new, regulated Bitcoin exchange for major banks. Until now, virtually all Bitcoin exchanges have allowed anyone to sign up and trade, which has made them harder to police. Companies dedicated to being more regulator-friendly for consumers and merchants, like BitPay, Coinbase and Circle, have also grown in number and size. BitPay, for example, is currently working with 24,000 merchants to take payments in Bitcoin, up from 10,000 last September and 1,000 in 2012, according to a spokeswoman. Last year, BitPay processed $110 million to $120 million in transactions. Some early Bitcoin adopters have been uncomfortable with the involvement of banks and regulators in a virtual currency whose early appeal was its apparent freedom from any central bank or government. But many of the new Bitcoin companies have said that virtual currencies will have to face more regulation if they want to be widely used. “I think it’s important always to know what the rules of the game are,” said Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. In Japan, financial regulators have so far declined to step in to help Mt. Gox customers, saying the virtual coins are a traded product, not a currency, and therefore remain outside of their purview. Tibanne, the company that operates Mt. Gox out of Tokyo, according to the local registry office, has told other Bitcoin companies that it is planning to file for bankruptcy, according to John O’Brien, a spokesman for Coinbase, a Bitcoin wallet. A bankruptcy administrator could distribute Mt. Gox’s assets — any remaining Bitcoins plus any nonvirtual cash — to its creditors, a process that could take a year or more. But the company could also be acquired, given the value of its customer list and name recognition. Even those who fear they have lost money they held with Mt. Gox remained enthusiastic on Tuesday about the potential of virtual currencies. “My thoughts and my heart also go out to all of those others in the community who lost a lot more than me today,” said Rick Falkvinge, the 42-year-old founder of the Pirate political party based in Sweden. Despite losing what he said was $80,000 in Mt. Gox, Mr. Falkvinge said that he remained “absolutely bullish on Bitcoin.” Hiroko Tabuchi and Ben Protess  contributed reporting.",0.1046086206896552,0.07101958625665522

Its clients would be in a panic and customers of rival firms would be very nervous. That is exactly what has happened to Bitcoin, the leading pseudo-currency. The website of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in Tokyo disappeared from cyberspace on Tuesday morning, with no explanation provided. The exchange had previously admitted to problems with “transaction malleability,” a Bitcoin-world euphemism for susceptibility to hacking. Internet chat was intense. What looks like an internal memo from the company was circulating the web, stating that there had been thefts from accounts that Mt. Gox customers had assumed were perfectly safe. It is not clear whether the document is genuine. The price of Bitcoin on other exchanges dropped 8 percent, down 55 percent from last November’s all-time high, according to bitcoinaverage.com. If Mt. Gox were an officially licensed broker, the government would be the first port of call. The relevant authorities would investigate and might even make good on some losses under a taxpayer- or industry-funded compensation scheme. Of course, if Mt. Gox had to meet government-mandated security standards, it might not have been allowed to operate without correcting a software vulnerability identified as far back as 2011. But Bitcoin’s central appeal is that it is free from government interference. That is not quite true, since Bitcoin cannot make illegal activity legal. Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem was an industry leader until his January indictment on charges  that he used the techno-currency to launder money. Still, the distance from the official world is great enough that Mt. Gox customers are almost totally on their own. The purported internal memo suggests that other Bitcoin fans might help out, so as to salvage the would-be financial asset’s reputation. That’s a thin reed to cling to. The expensive regulation and political backstops of conventional money are far from foolproof – look at the recently released Federal Reserve minutes from 2008 to see dysfunction in action. But the system is better than any known alternative, including one based on sophisticated software algorithms.

Gox remained closed on Tuesday morning, one of Bitcoin’s most vocal cheerleaders portrayed the turmoil as an isolated problem. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, whose firm has invested millions of dollars in Bitcoin-related start-ups, drew a comparison to MF Global, the brokerage firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2011.  “This is like MF Global, not some huge breakdown of the underlying technology or other exchanges,” Mr. Andreessen said in comments aired by CNBC on Tuesday morning. “Bitcoin protocol is unchanged and other Bitcoin exchanges and companies are doing fine.” The price of Bitcoin extended its decline on Tuesday, hitting a low of about $419 before recovering somewhat to around $510, according to CoinDesk, news provider for virtual currencies. On Monday, it dipped below $500 for the first time since November, when it began a rally that it took it above $1,200.  A number of leading Bitcoin companies said on Monday that Mt. Gox, which handles about 6 percent of all Bitcoins in circulation, planned to file for bankruptcy after months of problems. A document circling widely in the Bitcoin world pointed to a theft of nearly all of Mt. Gox’s 744,000 Bitcoins, although the legitimacy of the document or its claim has not yet been verified. “In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on Mt. Gox’s operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users,” said a statement on the Mt. Gox website on Tuesday. “We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.” Technology issues forced Mt. Gox to suspend withdrawals earlier this month, and many investors took to the online message board Reddit on Monday night to share how much they thought they had lost. “As much as I kick myself for not getting it out, I’m also patting myself on the back for getting most of my holdings out in time, when the writing on the wall became clearer,” said one user, whose claims could not be confirmed. In his comments on television, Mr. Andreessen said Mt. Gox “has been obviously broken and possibly outright crooked for months.” But his comparison to MF Global struck some observers as less than comforting. The saga surrounding MF Global, which collapsed when investors and ratings agencies became unnerved by its large position in European sovereign debt, raised broader questions about the safety of customer funds. In MF Global’s case, $1.6 billion of customer money went missing, and clients questioned the oversight of the firm.

On Monday night, a number of leading Bitcoin companies jointly announced that Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for most of Bitcoin’s existence, was planning to file for bankruptcy after months of technological problems and what appeared to have been a major theft. A document circulating widely in the Bitcoin world said the company had lost 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft that had gone unnoticed for years. That would be about 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation. While Mt. Gox did not respond to numerous requests for comments, and the companies issuing the statement scrambled to determine the exact situation at Mt. Gox, which is based in Japan, the news helped push the price of a single Bitcoin below $500 for the first time since November, when it began a spike that took it above $1,200. But at the same time that the news about Mt. Gox was emerging, a New York firm announced plans to create an exchange that could draw the world’s largest banks into the virtual currency market for the first time. The new exchange is being put together by SecondMarket, which rose to fame a few years ago after creating a platform for buying and selling shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook before they went public.  Without the trouble at Mt. Gox, the SecondMarket plans would have been seen as a major boon for virtual currencies, providing a potential entry point into the Bitcoin market for large banks, which have so far avoided virtual currencies as their price has skyrocketed. Barry Silbert, SecondMarket’s chief executive, said that he had already talked with several banks and financial companies about joining the new exchange, along with financial regulators, and that he hoped to have it in operation this summer. But plans for any new venture will be tested by the collapse of Mt. Gox, which could shake the faith of early Bitcoin adopters. Ryan Galt, a blogger who writes frequently about Bitcoin and was one of the first to circulate the news about Mt. Gox, wrote on Monday: “I do believe that this is one of the existential threats to Bitcoin that many have feared and have personally sold all of my Bitcoin holdings.”  On Monday, Mt. Gox took down all of its previous posts on Twitter, one day after its chief executive, Mark Karpeles, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for virtual currencies.  A statement from the chief executives of Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, Circle, Blockchain.info and Payward, said that the “tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company’s abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry.”  The events are in keeping with the stark ups and downs of Bitcoin’s short existence. Released in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin program runs on the computers of anyone who joins in, and it is set to release only 21 million coins in regular increments. The coins can be moved between digital wallets using secret passwords. While Bitcoin fans have said the technology could provide a revolutionary new way of moving money around the world, skeptics have viewed it variously as a Ponzi scheme or an investment susceptible to fraud and theft.  Many leading names in the Bitcoin community were still trying to determine the scope and potential consequences of the troubles at Mt. Gox. A document detailing the purported theft, labeled “Crisis Strategy Draft,” appeared to come from Mt. Gox.  While officials at the Bitcoin Foundation could not verify the origins of the document, they were preparing for the closure of Mt. Gox. Patrick Murck, the foundation’s general counsel, said that “this incident just demonstrates the need for initiatives by responsible individuals and responsible members of the Bitcoin community like what’s being described” in SecondMarket’s initiative. Mt. Gox’s difficulties this week are only the latest in a long line of problems at the Tokyo-based exchange. Created in 2010, Mt. Gox quickly became the most popular place to buy and sell Bitcoins. But the firm has suffered several intrusions and technological mishaps, which have led to steep declines in the currency’s price. A few weeks ago the company stopped allowing its customers to withdraw Bitcoins after it said it had discovered a flaw in some of the basic Bitcoin computer code.  While other exchanges were briefly hit by problems, they came back online. Mt. Gox never opened up again, prompting speculation about its future. Until now, the major Bitcoin exchanges have all allowed anyone from the public to buy and sell virtual currency. SecondMarket’s plan is to create a platform more like the New York Stock Exchange, where only large institutions can join and trade. Mr. Silbert says he will only open the exchange once they have several regulated financial institutions signed on as members. His hope, he says, is to give them partial ownership so that they have an incentive to trade there. For much of Bitcoin’s life, banks have viewed the virtual currency with either derision or dismissiveness. Recently, though, a number of banks have released research reports that have been less negative. A December report from Bank of America said that virtual currencies could become an important new part of the payment system, allowing money to move more cheaply than it does with credit cards and money transmitters like Western Union. The statement from the Bitcoin companies on Monday night, which was not signed by Mr. Silbert, said that “in order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible Bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of Bitcoin and the security of all customer funds.”",0.0014509803921568618,0.026871533967122198

But some people are willing to accept them as payment. A prominent example is WhatsApp’s founders and financial backers, who happily exchanged their stakes in the text-messaging start-up for Facebook stock worth $15 billion. Yet Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, would have struggled to purchase a coffee with his shares at the German bakery where he and WhatsApp’s chief executive, Jan Koum, appear to have hatched the deal. Similarly, Bitcoin enjoys no universal acceptance. True, at Bandana’s Bar-B-Q in Coralville, Iowa, the currency will buy a slab of ribs. But it will not get a Big Mac at any of McDonald’s 14,000 outlets in the United States. Bitcoin is not money as most people understand it. There is no Treasury Department controlling its issuance or value. It is backed only by mathematics, and its total stock is limited at 21 million virtual coins. In that sense, Bitcoin is only as useful as the network of people and businesses that are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services. It goes without saying that a similar “network effect” underpins Facebook’s entire existence. There is one big difference. Unlike Bitcoin, Facebook’s share count can expand. Last week, it issued 182 million new shares and 46 million restricted stock units to WhatsApp’s owners, adding some 9 percent to the total of shares outstanding. Such share-printing could undermine the share’s value, just as governments debase their currencies by printing too much money. Of course, Facebook does something – it’s not merely a putative store of value like Bitcoin. So it can grow into its larger equity base. The risk for Facebook and Bitcoin, respectively, is that someone creates a better social network or decentralized digital currency. History suggests both will happen – innovators almost never retain their dominant positions ad infinitum. Indeed, there are signs this may already be occurring. So far, Facebook shareholders are happy with their dilution. The stock price rose on the purchase of an upstart with no financial track record on which to judge its future success within Facebook. However, the acquisition makes Mr. Zuckerberg look fearful. Although Facebook’s business is robust today, it seems that it must make big, near-blind wagers on the next big thing, lest it lose its edge. The fundamental value of Bitcoin is incredibly tricky to pin down. According to The MIT Technology Review, Bitcoin was four times more volatile in 2013 than the average stock, and the dollar-Bitcoin exchange rate was 10 times more volatile than the dollar rate with major currencies like the euro or yen. What’s not hard to recognize: Bitcoin’s worth has nearly halved since the beginning of December. Whatever the similarities, or differences, between the pseudo-currencies of Facebook shares and Bitcoins are, their values are clearly not fixed. Next to selling them, the wisest course of action would be to capitalize on their value. Mr. Zuckerberg just did that with Facebook stock in the WhatsApp deal.

The most fundamental threat was a bug in some basic software that determines how Bitcoins are moved between digital accounts. That forced several of the largest Bitcoin exchanges to shut down for most of last week and raised questions about the sturdiness of the programming underlying the currency. At the same time, the system proved vulnerable to a hacking attack, creating doubts about the strength of the network’s security. Regulators also indicated last week that they were moving ahead with new rules for virtual currencies, leading to some fears that burdensome laws could halt Bitcoin in its tracks. These worries sent the price of Bitcoin swinging between a high of about $700 last Monday and a low of $530 on Friday, with some expecting even bigger declines. The current prices are down from highs of about $1,200 in December. “We are at this inflection point where the hard questions are being asked and will hopefully soon be answered,” Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top financial regulator, said in an interview. Bitcoin has already survived several bouts of volatility that were even wilder than the one last week. But during those crises, nearly everyone involved was a speculator and the currency was much further from real-world success. Now that Silicon Valley and Wall Street have begun to buy in, and everyday uses for Bitcoin are becoming more common, the stakes are much higher. In the same week that Bitcoin was besieged by hackers, Overstock.com, one of the largest companies to accept Bitcoin as payment, said it was nearing $1 million in purchases made with the currency. Mr. Lawsky has been leading efforts to write regulations for virtual currencies, in part to improve confidence in the system. At an all-day event last Tuesday at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit public policy institute, Mr. Lawsky said he hoped to “put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York.” The same day, Canada’s finance minister, Jim Flaherty, announced his plan to create national rules for what has been a largely lawless space. These efforts are more encouraging for Bitcoin’s future than Russia’s recent decision to declare virtual currencies illegal. But the Bitcoin Financial Association started a petition to Mr. Lawsky titled “Please Do Not Regulate Bitcoin,” in which it argued that Bitcoin was too young and vulnerable to be able to survive significant regulations. Other supporters, however, have recently been pressing for closer cooperation with both regulators and banks. One of the most contentious efforts by some Bitcoin entrepreneurs has been a proposal to tag the digital coins to make it possible to determine if a particular coin had been used for illegal activities. Such a system would make banks more comfortable in handling Bitcoin transactions. But the effort has faced intense opposition from early Bitcoin adopters who were drawn to the virtual currency because it allowed them to avoid scrutiny from governments and banks. This is only one of the disputes dividing the community of Bitcoin supporters. The winners will determine whether the virtual currency will simply be absorbed into the existing financial system or whether it will remain a new tool for people who want to circumvent the government and Wall Street, occasionally for illegal purposes like buying drugs or weapons. Susan Athey, a professor of economics at Stanford Business School, pointed to several potential outcomes. It is possible, she said, that banks will simply adopt some of the best elements of the Bitcoin program that allow money to be transferred almost instantaneously. Other alternative virtual currencies could also rise up without Bitcoin’s perceived flaws, like the limit on the number of Bitcoins that can ever be created. Professor Athey is assuming that “some of each of these things happen,” she said. “Once you look at it,” she added, “you say, ‘How is it we are still using these archaic financial rails?’ ” But if Bitcoin is to have any chance of success, its digital architecture is going to have to prove its sturdiness under increasingly difficult conditions. The most recent doubts were raised when a Bitcoin exchange that was once the largest in the world, Mt. Gox, almost shut down completely after discovering that customers could make transactions disappear from its records. While this initially appeared to be a problem limited solely to Mt. Gox, it spread to several other large exchanges, and the Bitcoin Foundation acknowledged that it was a flaw that developers had long been aware of. With the issue out in the open, hackers began an attack on the main exchanges. All of this put the developers who work on Bitcoin’s open-source computer code into a frenzy of programming. The chief scientist at the foundation, Gavin Andresen, posted his activity on Twitter on Thursday: “Today was about ignoring people and Deep Coding.” By Friday, it appeared that the problem was largely under control, and the largest exchange, Bitstamp, reopened. That helped the price of a Bitcoin rise to $660 on Friday evening from $532 in the morning. Jeff Garzik, one of the currency’s longtime developers, said that the problems exposed last week should not be a long-term issue for the network. But he acknowledged that Bitcoin would still face significant tests. “We’re still a very young ecosystem,” said Mr. Garzik, who now works for the Bitcoin company Bitpay. “I’m certain that bigger and much more devastating attacks will occur in Bitcoin’s lifetime. That’s the nature of the beast.” Mr. Garzik expressed his confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to survive attacks because of the collaborative nature of the programmers working on it. At the same time, he said that he was drawn to Bitcoin not because he thought it would take over the world but because it was a “fascinating experiment at several levels.” The last year, he said, was a year of “increasing visibility.” The next year, he said “will be the year of action.”",-0.016587234042553196,0.042957884314267294

Gox,” said Sarah Meiklejohn, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego who studies virtual currencies. Mt. Gox is not the only early leader in the virtual currency world to stumble as Bitcoin has grown more popular. Charles Shrem, a founder of one of the most popular early Bitcoin websites, BitInstant, was arrested in late January and accused of helping people make drug purchases with Bitcoins. Edward W. Felten, a professor at Princeton University who has studied Bitcoin, said, “We’re seeing a shakeout where the companies that are weaker in terms of management and technical execution are being weeded out.” At the same time, Bitcoin developers did acknowledge that weaknesses remained in the currency’s underlying protocol and that more work was needed to ready the currency for widespread use. “This is a good reminder that Bitcoin is still young and experimental,” the lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, Gavin Andresen, said in a statement on Monday. Bitcoin has drawn many fans because it runs according to computer code, and is thus theoretically immune to human error. Some critics, though, have long said that computer code can be susceptible to flaws or manipulation. The problems at Mt. Gox came after what had already been a bad week for Bitcoin, which many believe holds the promise of becoming a faster, cheaper way of moving money around the world. The Russian government announced last Thursday that it would treat virtual currency transactions as illegal. The Prosecutor General’s Office in Russia said that “citizens and legal entities risk being drawn — even unintentionally — into illegal activity, including laundering of money obtained through crime, as well as financing terrorism.” Russia had been one of the places where Bitcoin was growing the fastest. In the United States, officials have generally been cautiously supportive. But on the same day as the Russian announcement, police charged two men in Florida with using Bitcoins to launder money. The recent big movements in the price of Bitcoin seem to be driven largely by the turmoil at Mt. Gox. Last week, a growing number of customers were complaining about their inability to withdraw money from their Mt. Gox accounts. Then on Friday, the company officially stopped any further withdrawals. On Monday, the currency plummeted, trading at about $650 by evening, down from about $850 at the beginning of last week. Founded initially as a place to trade a type of card used in role-playing games, Mt. Gox became a Bitcoin exchange in 2010 and quickly rose to become the most popular place to acquire the virtual currency for government-issued currency. But the company has suffered several setbacks. In 2011, a hacking attack helped precipitate the first crash in the price of Bitcoin. In the years that followed, Mt. Gox had trouble processing customer transactions at times, slowing trade. And last May, United States authorities seized the company’s American bank accounts, saying it had not properly registered as a “money transmitter.” Since then, Mt. Gox has filed the necessary paperwork and tried to recoup its early success, but many customers have been suspicious. Those using the exchange have complained that it has not been easy to move money in or out. The exchange’s market share for dollar transactions has fallen to about 20 percent from more than 80 percent early last year, according to the Genesis Block, a research firm. Still, Mt. Gox’s contentions about the Bitcoin code were taken seriously on Monday because they raised basic questions about the soundness of the currency. From the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, one of the most important and vaunted features of its protocol was its ability to prevent the same coins from being moved to two different places at the same time. In its announcement on Monday, Mt. Gox said that a bug in the Bitcoin software made it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it appear that a Bitcoin transfer had not taken place when, in fact, it had. The company said: “We have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow Bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized.” Other exchanges did not report similar problems, and Mr. Felten of Princeton said that the issue described by Mt. Gox had been known for years and dealt with by other companies through some simple coding changes. “It does say something about the rough edges of the Bitcoin technology,” Mr. Felten said. At the same time, he added, “It’s an issue that is likely to be fixed in the longer run, and that can be programmed around.”",-0.09072199999999998,0.03390634920634922

It’s a change that the PointsHound cofounder Pete Van Dorn said he hopes will attract more bookings. “We started to use Bitcoin as just another currency that can be earned and burned,” Mr. Van Dorn said. The new program is a way for infrequent travelers who may not use traditional points systems to get more value from their vacation, Mr. Van Dorn said. Travelers choosing the option must have a Bitcoin wallet, obtainable through Coinbase.com and other online exchanges. PointsHound’s algorithms calculate the reward value based on Coinbase’s rate — currently hovering at nearly $800 per coin — and reward users with a slice of Bitcoin per reservation. “We carve out a portion of the commission to give back to the customer in the currency of your choice. It might be 5,000 miles, it might be Bitcoin,” Mr. Van Dorn said. He said the Bitcoin payout, so far, is attracting a different type of consumer than PointsHound’s typical “road warrior” clientele. “If you don’t travel as much, you may select Bitcoin because you may not have as much use for the loyalty currency and you may want to speculate” on Bitcoin’s increasing value, Mr. Van Dorn said. “It’s appealing to a younger, more tech-savvy consumer that has already adopted this currency.” The virtual currency has additional potential for travelers because it is not ruled by a central bank, leaving it free of foreign transaction and banking fees, he said. “One very legitimate use case for Bitcoin is in travel. It’s international currency. We’re hoping it solves some of the complexity” of payment in foreign countries, he said. Some companies are adopting Bitcoin for this reason. TravelForCoins.com and BtcTrip.com, for example, deal exclusively in the virtual currency, and Virgin Galactic is accepting reservations in Bitcoin for its space voyages.

With the frenetic pace of a sports announcer, Mr. Shrem, the co-founder of a popular website where Bitcoins could be bought using dollars, jumped between his idea for a Bitcoin debit card; his recent conversations with the owners of a private jet company who wanted to take payment in Bitcoin; his goal of unifying the country’s money transfer laws; and his travel plans to just about every corner of the world, including the trip to Amsterdam he was returning from when he was arrested last week. “Bitcoin really allows you to have such a global life — it allows you to be able to move anywhere within days if you want to,” the scruffily bearded Mr. Shrem said, standing in front of the sign announcing that the bar, EVR, would accept Bitcoin. These days, though, Mr. Shrem’s exploits in Bitcoin have him restricted to his parents’ home in Brooklyn, where he awaits trial on federal charges that he smoothed the way for drug transactions online. Mr. Shrem was also accused of buying marijuana himself. He has pleaded not guilty. The 24-year-old Mr. Shrem, who went through millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin over the years, is not the first person in the virtual currency world to end up in handcuffs, but he is the most central player to face charges. His recent reversal of fortune — and the meteoric ascent that led up to it — makes him a living symbol of the peaks and valleys that have so far defined the Bitcoin experience, as the value of all the outstanding coins has shot above $10 billion. The virtual currency — digital money that can be traded between online wallets using virtual keys — has given rise to world-changing ambitions, new-money fortunes and global jet-setting. But all the high living has often seemed just a hairbreadth away from a police raid or government crackdown. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Shrem said that, particularly during the early days of Bitcoin, it often was not clear what was right and wrong. “You had so many bad things going on, and so little good, that you had to dive down into it to bring it up,” he said. For his own part, he acknowledged, “back then I wasn’t as educated on what was legal and what was not legal.” The uncertainty stems, in no small part, from the lack of clarity about what laws apply to Bitcoin transactions — and the relative lack of interest from law enforcement. But in addition to that uncertainty, Bitcoin’s troubles have arisen from its tendency to attract maverick characters who want to test the established order. Before his arrest, Mr. Shrem talked about his difficulties with traditional banks. “I don’t actually have a bank account,” he said with an impish grin that he has flashed during many speaking engagements. “No real bank would bank me.” Jerry Brito, a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that Mr. Shrem was “quite a compelling story — a sort of rags-to-riches story, made possible through Bitcoin.” But, Mr. Brito said, many of the early entrepreneurs may not have had the proper tools for the world they were entering. “These people were not ready for what they found themselves in the middle of,” Mr. Brito said. Since Mr. Shrem’s arrest, some of the top figures in the Bitcoin world have distanced themselves from his activities. The Bitcoin Foundation, where Mr. Shrem was vice chairman, said in a statement after he resigned that it was “worth noting that the indictment itself is not against Bitcoin or the community at large.” But a few have come to his support. Roger Ver, an early investor in Mr. Shrem’s company, said that Mr. Shrem was a “trustworthy person, who would never commit a crime in which there is a victim.” Nearly everyone who knows Mr. Shrem agrees that he was a charismatic salesman for Bitcoin from almost the first moment he encountered the digital money. Mr. Shrem has said that he began dabbling in Bitcoin during his final year at Brooklyn College in 2011. He had grown up in Brooklyn, graduated from Yeshiva of Flatbush, a private Jewish school, and founded a start-up during his first years in college. But Bitcoin quickly became his passion. “I became obsessed,” he told the website MeetInnovators last year. He quickly realized how hard it was to exchange dollars into Bitcoin, and so he helped found his company, BitInstant, with another early adopter he met online. To raise money for BitInstant, Mr. Shrem turned on all his salesman charms, even with his mother. “I said, ‘Mom, I love this idea and I put all my money into it, and we’re growing so quickly,’ ” he said during an interview last year with the Russian-owned television station RT. “She wrote me a check that day.” He used similar powers of persuasion with Mr. Ver and the Winklevoss brothers, of Facebook fame, who helped lead a $1.5 million fund-raising round. The brothers have said since Mr. Shrem’s arrest that, “We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.” Mr. Shrem’s charisma quickly took him beyond the bounds of his company. He was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation board. He became a regular speaker at Bitcoin events. And he made an investment, in Bitcoin, in EVR, the bar founded by a few friends, which became a regular site for Bitcoin parties. He lived with the other owners in a five-bedroom apartment above the bar and hung out with his girlfriend, who sometimes worked as a bartender downstairs. A profile of Mr. Shrem last year on the website Vocativ said that in the middle of all this, Mr. Shrem never stopped having fun. According to the article, Mr. Shrem said, “I won’t hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with you.” Mr. Shrem said this week that the comment was taken out of context and was only a joke. But he has never been shy about how widely he ranged in the Bitcoin world. During the recent interview at EVR, he recounted a conversation with a former financial regulator: “She was like, ‘Charlie, you and some of your friends have become such super experts in finance, law and the Patriot Act and all these things.’ ” “And I’m like, ‘It’s Bitcoin,’ ” he said. In the end, it was his basic business that got him in trouble. The indictment on money-laundering charges, filed on Jan. 27, contends that he helped exchange dollars into Bitcoin for people who wanted to buy drugs on the online bazaar Silk Road despite knowing their intent and being warned by his business partner. The charges were surprising given that Mr. Shrem often appeared at Bitcoin events talking about how to trade Bitcoin legally. At a Bitcoin conference last year, he boasted that BitInstant was “going to be the shining city on the hill.” “We’re going to be the company that succeeded in the United States,” he said. “Worked with governments. Worked with banks. Did compliance.” At the same time, Mr. Shrem acknowledged that he tested the limits of how much information the government required him to collect from his customers. “You trust us, we trust you,” is how he described his company’s philosophy at the conference last year. “A lot of regulators frowned on that with me. But we said, ‘It’s going to work,’ and it has worked so far.” A few months after that event, BitInstant’s bank shut down the company’s account suddenly. The company went offline soon after that and faced a lawsuit from customers who said the company had misrepresented its services, and sought class-action status. But that had not put a crimp in his big plans. Last month, his goal was to reopen BitInstant in the first quarter of this year after more fund-raising. After the arrest, he is not supposed to deal in Bitcoin, but his big ambitions for the currency, and himself, have not faded. “Given the opportunity, I will get back on the speaking circuit and be an evangelizer for Bitcoin,” he said on Thursday. “At the same time, the more high-profile you are, the more careful you have to be. It’s scary.”",0.04937195121951219,0.044047619047619044

273,More Bitcoin Regulation Is Inevitable,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/more-bitcoin-regulation-is-inevitable/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-02-03T15:56:20+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," The next phase in the development of virtual currencies like Bitcoin was highlighted at a hearing last week conducted by Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top banking regulator. The question is not whether there will be greater regulation of firms developing new methods of transmitting payments with nongovernment currencies, but how much regulation they will face. The idea that Bitcoin could be an alternative to traditional money that would allow users to conduct transactions anonymously beyond the pale of intrusive government regulators has proved to be little more than a pipe dream. In testimony at last week’s hearing, Barry E. Silbert, the founder of Bitcoin Investment Trust, acknowledged that “it may be appropriate to regulate any transaction that involves an unregulated intermediary converting Bitcoin to dollars on behalf of a third party.” As if to make the message especially clear that the government is keeping a close eye, the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint the day before the hearings charging two men with using a Bitcoin exchange to help pay for illegal narcotics transactions. One defendant, Charlie Shrem, was on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, which is promoting the virtual currency as a new means for conducting business around the world.  Federal regulators have already been going after companies that allow payments in virtual currencies. In March 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a part of the Treasury Department known as FinCen, issued guidance stating that anyone operating an exchange for virtual currencies would be considered to be running a money transmitting business.   That designation means exchanges must collect information about customers, as required under Bank Secrecy Act regulations, which are intended to prevent transactions through anonymous accounts. FinCen went a step further in its guidance by including any person who puts into circulation a virtual currency, which means that the so-called Bitcoin miners are also subject to the regulations. (FinCen last week issued a letter clarifying that users mining Bitcoins for their own purposes would not be considered money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act). The only ones not subject to the Bank Secrecy Act are users of virtual currencies who only buy and sell goods and services. FinCen exempted their transactions, which means individuals and merchants who use Bitcoin like cash do not need to comply with the regulations imposed on those operating exchanges. If that were the extent of government regulation, there would be little concern about the negative effect of new rules on the development of virtual currencies. No one supports creating an anonymous bazaar for dealing in drugs and other illegal goods and services – except, perhaps, the criminals themselves. The more difficult issue is whether the government will reach further and try to impose more onerous rules on the exchanges and users of virtual currencies. It might be helpful to consider what underpins any form of currency. Putting it simply, there are two aspects to currency: the medium by which it is exchanged, and the promise it incorporates. The medium can be almost anything, from paper notes and coins to gold and silver to electronic credits stored in a financial institution or central bank account. When a government issues currency, it comes with the promise that it is a legitimate means of transacting business in that country. A dollar bill, for instance, states that it is “legal tender for all debts, public and private.”  But virtual currencies raise concerns about how they can be transmitted and used for illegal purposes. Testimony before Mr. Lawsky by Richard B. Zabel, the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan, highlighted the challenge facing law enforcement with the “ease of movement” that a medium like Bitcoin can provide.   Transferring $1 million in cash to buy drugs in another country would be difficult because of the sheer bulk of that much money and would probably get the attention of banking officials. Using the equivalent in Bitcoin, however, only involves a few keystrokes. So a virtual currency would be much more attractive than cash to those engaging in global illegal transactions. The regulations in place for virtual currency exchanges may not be enough to satisfy law enforcement’s desire to keep criminals from creating a new avenue for transferring value across borders. If someone was able to gather up enough Bitcoin while avoiding scrutiny from virtual currency exchanges, then the transactions could fly beneath the regulatory reporting rules. Regulators are also concerned that exchanges based in foreign countries might not impose the same customer disclosure requirements as the United States. If someone can use a foreign exchange to conduct business outside the American government’s watchful gaze, then criminals could find ways to slip between the cracks and avoid scrutiny.  Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, testified that “we need stronger tools to combat new emerging threats derived from these payment systems.”   It would not be a surprise if one tool would require those who control or trade over a certain threshold amount of a virtual currency to report their holdings to the government. This approach is much like the rules requiring the owner of 5 percent of the shares of a publicly traded company to disclose any transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission. One promise supporting government currencies is that they have a certain value. A central bank work tirelessly to maintain a target level for its currency in relation to other currencies, which explains why the fear of inflation is so great. Virtual currencies do not carry the same promise. So they depend on the market to determine their value, which is often stated in relation to a traditional currency, like the dollar or euro. The government has no stake in how Bitcoin is valued, but it is concerned that consumers be protected from abuses when they use a virtual currency to pay for goods and services. Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in value, highlighted by a chart from Coinbase showing that it increased over 400 percent in November and then lost nearly half its value in December. That type of volatility is an invitation to unscrupulous dealers and merchants to overcharge or underpay. To protect consumers who want to use Bitcoin for legitimate transactions, the government may adopt reporting requirements on virtual currency exchanges so that there is a public repository of information about prices. Although the government cannot control the value of a virtual currency, it can make the currency more transparent to users so that they are not defrauded.   Much as the S.E.C. and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate stock and futures exchanges, government regulators may require centralizing the trading in virtual currencies so that the market is less susceptible to manipulation. That is a short step from treating firms that trade in virtual currencies like stock and commodities brokers, which are subject to extensive disclosure and capital requirements. The days of anonymous transactions in Bitcoin and operating an exchange with no outside interference are over. As virtual currencies develop, firms devoted to aiding trading, and perhaps even their users, will encounter greater government regulation, along with the costs that come with compliance.

274,Law Enforcement Strikes Back in Bitcoin Hearing,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/law-enforcement-strikes-back-in-bitcoin-hearing/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-29T21:16:03+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Law enforcement officials testified on Wednesday that virtual currencies like Bitcoin had opened up new avenues for crime that government has not been able to keep up with. The most forceful statements came from a prosecutor with the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, Richard B. Zabel, during the second day of hearings about virtual currencies held by New York’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky. Mr. Zabel went through a list of six ways in which virtual currencies were more prone to crime than current forms of money transfer, including the ease with which money could be laundered over borders at the click of a mouse. The testimony of Mr. Zabel and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, was a blow to Bitcoin advocates who have said that digital money carries no more risk than ordinary money and should not be treated with harsher regulations. Both Mr. Zabel and Mr. Vance said they needed more tools than they now possessed to stem the tide of problems cropping up with virtual currencies as they have become more popular. “Whatever weaknesses they have must be addressed much more seriously,” Mr. Zabel said. Mr. Lawsky has indicated that Bitcoin is becoming popular enough that regulators need to create regulations that can encourage its growth but limit illegal activity. The price of an individual Bitcoin has risen more than 5,000 percent over the last year, but there has also been a growing list of serious crimes committed in the Bitcoin network, which government officials have struggled to clamp down on. For their part, Bitcoin advocates have said virtual currencies are no more prone to crime than credit cards or cash. One of the most popular arguments put forward is that transactions done by criminals using Bitcoin are easy for law enforcement to trace because of the public ledger where transactions are recorded. Earlier this week, Mr. Zabel’s office unsealed a complaint against two men accused of helping exchange Bitcoins for people interested in making drug purchases. On Tuesday, during the first day of the hearings, Tyler Winklevoss, a Bitcoin investor with his twin brother, Cameron, said that “Bitcoin is a terrible place for criminals to conduct criminal activity” because of the public ledger. But Mr. Zabel said that while it might be possible to find the computer that a particular Bitcoin purchase came from, digital money users had countless ways to cover their tracks that were not available to people going through traditional banks. Mr. Zabel was involved in the team that tracked down Ross Ulbricht, whom the authorities contend is the owner of the Silk Road online market, where drugs and child pornography were available. Mr. Ulbricht used a so-called Tor network to obscure himself, the authorities said, and Mr. Zabel said it was only after overcoming “substantial hurdles” that his office found Mr. Ulbricht. Another argument put forward by virtual currency advocates is that cash is actually more attractive to criminals than new forms of digital money, because cash can be moved without any digital trace. Mr. Zabel struck back at that idea by pointing to the difficulty of moving large amounts of cash around the globe. “Although cash is also an anonymous form of currency, there are significant barriers to transferring bulk cash out of the banking system,” he said. The people representing the Bitcoin industry at the hearings pushed back against any strenuous new regulations on virtual currency companies. But at another panel on Wednesday, top executives of two of the most prominent Bitcoin companies said they were hoping that Mr. Lawsky does provide more regulatory clarity so that everyone will feel more comfortable using digital money. “Regulation could be a good thing,” said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, the largest middleman for Bitcoin transactions. Regulators around the world have been grappling with the appropriate way to treat Bitcoin, coming up with very different approaches. The Chinese government recently made many types of virtual currency transactions illegal. The hearings in New York drew a global audience. Mr. Lawsky said viewers from 108 different countries tuned in to the webcast his office set up.",-0.03506046511627907,0.10372730628544581
275,Bitcoin Figure Is Accused of Conspiring to Launder Money,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/two-executives-of-bitcoin-businesses-are-arrested/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-27T19:34:45+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"One of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin universe, Charles Shrem, was arrested by federal authorities on Sunday and accused of helping smooth the way for drug transactions on the now-defunct online bazaar Silk Road. Mr. Shrem was a co-founder and chief executive of a popular website, BitInstant, where Bitcoins could be bought using dollars. At the age of 24, Mr. Shrem was a regular speaker on the Bitcoin convention circuit, and was also on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that educates the public on digital money. The criminal charges unsealed on Monday by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan claim that Mr. Shrem used his company to knowingly convert money into virtual currency for people interested in buying narcotics on the Silk Road site. He was also accused of personally buying drugs on the site. According to the complaint, the scheme was operated in cooperation with another man, Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing, who was arrested on Monday in Florida. The case is already causing discomfort in Bitcoin circles, where the line between legal and illegal enterprises has long been somewhat blurry, hindering public acceptance of digital money. The price of Bitcoin dropped after the announcement of the arrests on Monday, and was down over 7 percent in the evening to around $810. Even as the popularity of virtual currencies has exploded — the price of a single Bitcoin is up over 5,000 percent in the last year — government officials have not yet come up with clear regulation governing the use of virtual currencies under the law. That fact has made it easier for theft and fraud to occur even on legitimate websites. BitInstant appeared to be firmly in the camp of legitimate virtual currency businesses earlier this year. The company won the backing of Winklevoss Capital Management, which is run by the Winklevoss twins, who were early players in Facebook. After the arrests, the Winklevoss brothers put out a statement saying that they “are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest,” and “support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money-laundering requirements are enforced.” The brothers also said that they “look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of Bitcoins.” The issue is likely to come up on Tuesday at the beginning of a two-day hearing on how regulators should deal with Bitcoin, organized by the New York State superintendent of financial services, Benjamin M. Lawsky. The Winklevoss brothers are both scheduled to testify. When the Silk Road website was shut down last year, many Bitcoin fans cheered, arguing that the action was important in stamping out the illegal activity that had thrived in the early days of Bitcoin. Since then, the price of Bitcoin has risen and many mainstream investors have expressed interest in the currency’s possibilities. But Mr. Shrem’s arrest may again raise questions about the distance between the legal problems in Bitcoin’s past and its legitimate financial opportunities. The complaint unsealed on Monday suggested that Mr. Shrem and his business partners were themselves grappling with what was and was not allowed. When a co-founder of BitInstant asked Mr. Shrem why he was working with someone with such clear affiliation with Silk Road, Mr. Shrem wrote in an email in 2012 that, “he has not broken a law and Silk Road itself is not illegal,” according to the complaint. Mr. Shrem added, “We make good profit from him.” The United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, said in a statement on Monday, “We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.” Mr. Shrem and Mr. Faiella were both charged with conspiring to launder money, and Mr. Shrem was also charged with “willfully failing to file any suspicious activity report” about Mr. Faiella’s work. BitInstant stopped operating last summer for reasons that remain unclear. Customers later filed suit against the company, claiming that the company misrepresented its services, and sought class-action status. But the site was viewed as a pioneer in the industry, and Mr. Shrem recently said that he planned to restart it. Mr. Shrem has also been an outspoken champion of the virtual currency. On the day he was arrested, he was scheduled to be a featured speaker at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. He was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On Monday, Mr. Shrem was still listed as a member of the Bitcoin Foundation’s board. “We are surprised and shocked by the news today,” a spokeswoman for the foundation, Jinyoung Englund, said. “As a foundation, we take these allegations seriously and do not condone illegal activity.”",-0.03042608695652174,0.009954670932931804
276,Bitcoin and the Fictions of Money,https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/bitcoin-and-the-fictions-of-money/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-27T14:30:51+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," How should we think about a currency like Bitcoin? The first thing to remember is this: Money is a sort of collective fiction. What money we choose to trust says much about how we see the world. Above the simplest exchanges, most money has limited use. Gold, the most common historical currency, is almost only good for adornment. To its fans, gold’s uselessness is a value in itself; since the stock of gold is not consumed, it’s reasonably stable, while governments can print all the currency they want. Paper is, of course, a proxy for the government issuing the money. How much we trust the government’s ability to collect taxes, pay debts, and so on is the collective fiction that gives a country’s money value. Paper or metal, money is worth something only if people continue to believe in it. And right now, an increasing number of people believe in Bitcoins and similar, emerging stateless currencies. From parity with the dollar three years ago, one Bitcoin is now just over $800. Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist whose firm has invested just under $50 million in start-ups related to Bitcoin, has written a very helpful introduction to Bitcoin in DealBook. It is also a spirited defense of Bitcoin. Mind you, a sensible person should read the essay aware that Mr. Andreessen has a significant number of United States dollars bet on Bitcoin’s increasing use. The journalist Glenn Fleishman, with whom Mr. Andreessen has been spiritedly debating Bitcoin on Twitter for several days, wrote a strong critique of Mr. Andreessen’s thinking. Much of the argument is about the mathematics, or whether Bitcoin is deflationary, or the way in which the creation of new Bitcoins burns increasing amounts of electricity to no good end. So far, there is little discussion of what the collective decision to believe a fiction like Bitcoin might mean. In many ways, that is the more interesting phenomenon. Certainly, it is applicable not just to Bitcoin, but to Bitcoin proxies like Zerocoin or to other new stateless, math-based currencies, like Ripple. It also sharpens current preoccupations in the high-tech world. In the place of believing in a central bank, or its owner, a powerful nation state, what do we believe in when we believe in Bitcoin? Specifics around the algorithm, of course. More deeply, we believe in a borderless world of hyper-empowered individuals, alive mostly through the Internet. They are not gated by language, thanks to image sharing and Google Translate. Many have sent thousands of messages around the world, without ever using a sovereign nation’s stamps. Many have never done national service in the physical world. Even more do not expect their children to fight in a country’s wars, at least not as soldiers carrying arms. (Cyberwar is another matter, perhaps.) None of this bodes well for the relationship between the most wealthy, powerful and gifted, and their home nations. In a telling moment a few months ago, I asked three tech executives – an American, a Czech and a Romanian – the following question: If I threw down five passports from “good” countries, like Germany or Singapore, would you care which one you picked up? No one would. Their business is on the Internet, everywhere and nowhere, and they have friends all over the world. Charles Stross, the science fiction writer, wrote in a strong critique of Bitcoin that it has an inherently elitist, libertarian agenda. Alex Payne, another critic, wrote a piece slamming one of Mr. Andreessen’s partners that took it farther, saying that belief in Bitcoin was another symptom of Silicon Valley’s enormous self-regard. By those lights, the old fiction of the central bank is being swapped for the new collective fiction of the almighty tech elite. That idea settles in uncomfortably close to recent calls by some prominent tech executives to detach, as much as possible, from the old, failed nations. San Francisco’s continuing antagonisms between tech workers and “normal” people takes on an even darker cast, once the protesters are seen as a crowd anxious at being left behind. There are also other fictions associated with other currencies. Ripple, developed after Bitcoin, hopes to be a kind of universal proxy currency, perhaps enabling the owner of a farm animal in Nepal to directly trade it for an iPhone in Britain, or American frequent-flyer miles to become gold in Mexico. “People will decide what kind of things they want to hold,” said Chris Larsen, the co-founder and chief executive of Ripple Labs, a company that is associated with the Ripple currency. “We think there will be an explosion of different currencies.” Ripple, the digital money, was created, open-sourced and put out into the world in a finite amount. Its presence is distributed over 50 servers on three continents, and all of them must agree on the rises or falls in the net value of the money. That should prevent the injection of new, inflationary Ripples being injected into the system. Even so, Mr. Larsen said that at this point it was “clearly a speculative market.” “Is Bitcoin Friendster, and we’re MySpace? I hope not,” he said, referring to a pair of the earliest social networks. “Are we still waiting for our Facebook? Possibly. People worry a lot about the dollar now.” It may be, as Mr. Larsen says, that math-based systems have a kind of purity, “the exchange of value within the exchange of information,” without the messy stuff of nations getting in the way. It may also be that life stays messy, and these new systems learn how to accommodate that, possibly by agreeing to be taxed by one or another government. The language we use around money is telling. Words like “currency,” “tender,” “exchange” bespeak a world of social interaction, trust. In the meantime, informal terms like “loot,” “lucre,” and even today’s “cheddar” (from government handouts of cheese) show our more problematic feelings about money. So far Bitcoin is spoken of in extreme terms, as a threat, or a bubble, or the empowerment of drug dealers. If it is taxed, and becomes normal, it may actually be more revolutionary. The poet Wallace Stevens called money “a kind of poetry.” He also had the horse sense to write his verses about the romance of the human imagination while walking to his job as a vice president for an insurance company. He knew both sides of the coin, when he said how closely the real and the imaginary need each other for society to work.",0.18811607142857145,0.14024389301175016

It’s also one of the biggest buzzwords in Silicon Valley, finance and government, where proponents say it can save money and increase trust in public institutions. In 2017, more than 200 government agencies around the world, including the Department of Homeland Security, were exploring the use of blockchain, according to the Blockchain in Government Tracker compiled by the Illinois Blockchain Initiative.

Now it’s used to describe a wide range of systems that incorporate cryptography or decentralized data storage. “I think it’s important to make clear that there is no one ‘blockchain,’” said Stefaan Verhulst, the co-founder of GovLab. “What we see right now is massive experimentation in different versions of blockchain technologies that provide for different results.” In theory, blockchain can save money and reduce errors by replacing workers, while adding accountability by generating a public record of all activity. This has even greater implications for countries with low trust in government, said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who specializes in distributed systems. “If you look at a government system that is opaque, that’s closed behind doors, versus one where I can inspect what’s going on behind it, it’s an amazing leap forward,” Mr. Sirer said. “It means sleeping better at night.” Blockchain can also enable seamless transactions with people outside the jurisdiction and give residents greater control over their data, advocates say. “We want you to buy a house while you’re lying on a couch somewhere,” said Zeina El Kaissi, head of emerging technology at Smart Dubai, which is leading the city’s blockchain initiative. “Blockchain can make that possible.” Dubai identified 21 uses for blockchain, including charging electric vehicles, obtaining notary services and ensuring food safety. About 12 blockchain-based services are being built, Ms. El Kaissi said. One goal is to ensure that Dubai residents can submit documentation for common tasks, like buying a home or applying to schools, digitally and only once. The current system often requires multiple visits to government offices. “Today we’re using human beings as data transfer tools,” Ms. El Kaissi said. “That’s just a waste of my human life, to be honest.” Government agencies usually aren’t the first to try new technology, but the momentum around the blockchain industry has spurred adoption. It helps that some vendors are offering their services pro bono or at a discount, avoiding what is typically an arduous procurement process. Still, there are significant challenges. The technology is immature, with problems around speed, volume and security, Mr. Sirer said. The industry is also immature, with new vendors popping up and dropping out. Finally, political bureaucracy can be a hindrance. Some high-profile projects have stalled. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority concluded that a digital currency would “look broadly similar to, and not clearly superior to, existing infrastructures.” The Texas company building a blockchain-based land registry in Honduras gave up because of communication problems with officials. Isle of Man’s plan to secure internet-connected devices with blockchain halted after the start-up behind it shut down because of a founder spat. Perhaps the biggest gap between expectations and reality occurred in Sierra Leone, where the Swiss foundation Agora was widely reported to have powered the first blockchain election. This turned out to be overzealous marketing. The National Electoral Commission denounced the reports as “fake news,” and Agora acknowledged that it had merely been allowed to record some votes in its presidential election on a blockchain as a demonstration. The Cook County Recorder of Deeds worked on a land registry pilot with velox.RE, a California-based start-up, as well as the New York office of the law firm Hogan Lovells, the Chicago law firm Goldberg Kohn, and Onyx Electronics of Valparaiso, Ind., all of which did the work for free. The pilot, which included creating blockchains for more than a million parcels, as well as research and encryption, took a team of nine people eight months. The system is accessible through a rudimentary website. If you look up the property status of 5801 South Ellis Avenue, for example, you will see hundreds of pairs of 64-character strings, which correspond to transactions going back to 1985. The pilot made it clear that some foundational work is needed before Illinois can move to a blockchain land registry, Mr. Mirkovic said. Records must be digitized. Data formats must be standardized. A law must be passed to require that title transfers be registered with the government. Finally, Illinois voters recently decided to merge the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Cook County Clerk’s office, which would delay any decision on blockchains until 2020. The pilot also showed that the agency could solve some problems without blockchain. The pilot inspired the office’s existing software vendor, Conduent, to integrate some blockchain-like concepts into its more conventional design. And in his post-mortem, Mr. Mirkovic pointed to Iowa, where land records were accurate, title insurance was cheap, and citizens could look up information in a statewide online database that did not use blockchain. Mr. Mirkovic hopes that his office can eventually use the technology. “I still believe the idea is too good to ignore,” he said. In the United States, some of the momentum around blockchain comes from a desire to attract blockchain businesses, investment and high-tech jobs. Illinois, which ran six blockchain pilots, promised to create a “welcoming regulatory environment” to draw companies to the state. Arizona, Delaware, Nevada, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming have passed blockchain-related laws. Proponents in those states praised legislatures for acting quickly to keep up with technology, but Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, is concerned that they’re making bad law. “A bunch of states are really in a rush to pass some sort of legislation to demonstrate how crypto-friendly or tech savvy they are,” she said. Estimates vary as to when blockchain will have an impact in government. Dubai’s goal is to have its systems running by 2020, but Mr. Sirer said it would take at least 10 years to see an improvement. “It’s definitely not a fast process,” he said.",0.12363787878787878,0.05705675076887198
278,Bitcoin Is Not Yet Ready for the Real World,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/bitcoin-is-not-yet-ready-for-the-real-world/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-24T16:54:39+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," It is understandable why some in the venture capital sector are over the moon about Bitcoin and its endless possibilities. Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, has about  50 million reasons why he wants Bitcoin to succeed. The only problem is that Bitcoin is a concept dreamed up in the virtual world and is not yet ready for the real world.  Bitcoin technology and its lower-cost payment system design may be elegant but that does not mean it should be blindly embraced and adopted. The payment system and Bitcoin as an e-currency can’t be divorced from each other. Before  Bitcoin becomes a regular and reliable method for consumer transactions, several significant risks need to be assessed and addressed: 
Reputational Risk 
Is Bitcoin an innovative response to facilitate meaningful commerce or simply a designer currency for the criminally inclined?  For Bitcoin to function as a currency, it has to be trusted as an honest means for transacting business.  Its reputation needs to be rock solid.  Since its inception, Bitcoin has been a decentralized experiment with a morphing purpose. In 2009, in response to the Great Recession, Bitcoin was seen as a way to take back control from irresponsible central bankers, reallocating power of currency to the people through computer code and a decentralized payment system.  However, creating an unregulated and untraceable currency also made it the currency of choice for those engaged in illicit activities.  The F.B.I.’s takedown of Silk Road in October 2013 significantly tarnished Bitcoin’s reputation by exposing a deep web of drugs, guns, prostitution, assassins for hire and a ready tool for tax evasion and money laundering.  Trojan Horse Risk
For the last five years, the pseudo name of Satoshi  Nakamoto has been used to symbolize the innovative genius (or team) behind Bitcoin.  Given that Bitcoin has mushroomed to $10 billion in value and prospects for commercialization abound, it is puzzling why this supposed e-currency messiah has not stepped forward. What if Satoshi Nakamoto is not real, and his likeness was manufactured by some cybercriminals to generate investor excitement?  At this embryonic stage it seems only logical that the true spokesman, not just someone from the venture capital industry, should step forward to part the waters, lead the followers and show the way.  Or at least be the industry face before the growing number of e-currency regulatory hearings that will help shape industry economics and future prospects.  Could it be that this coding genius is instead enjoying computer-manufactured riches on some remote, tax-free island, or is he a cyber-terrorist who upon Bitcoin adoption will activate a Trojan-horse virus to bring world commerce back to the Stone Age?

Asset Bubble Risk
The speculative mania generated around Bitcoin has created a hyper asset bubble that is ready to pop.  Since 2013, Bitcoin has risen from $13 to as high as $1,200 with price appreciation of more than 9,000 percent. There are 12.3 million coins outstanding, over 90 percent are hoarded, which helps to artificially inflate values.   Ownership is also extremely concentrated, increasing market manipulation risk. As prices have grown to the clouds, many Bitcoin millionaires have been minted along the way. But what supports these lofty prices?   Bitcoin is neither a legal entity, nor a start-up, and no stock is available for investors to purchase.  It has no management team, board, balance sheet, business plan or even a coherent vision on how to commercialize technology that has been given away in the market for free.  Even Mr. Andreessen, the venture capitalist, disclosed that he held only a de minimis amount of Bitcoin, making it clear that smart money is not betting on e-coins but directly on Bitcoin-related start-ups.   Increasingly, as Bitcoin investors gain greater awareness of what they actually bought (and more important not bought), values will fall further.  In the last month, Bitcoin has dropped by about 30 percent.  The bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will put in jeopardy the viability of the lauded payment system as it can’t be easily separated from the use of Bitcoin as its currency.  Consumer and Investor Protection Risk
Bitcoin is built around an unregulated, decentralized and untraceable coin. No legal protection is in place to assist consumers or investors.  If a consumer were to send a Bitcoin to the wrong e-wallet, if a hard drive storing coins were corrupted (intentionally or unintentionally), or an e-wallet picked, coin value is lost forever.  The chance of counterfeiting increases as the profit potential has risen. Already, of the e-coins outstanding, an estimated 4 percent, or $400 million, have been permanently lost.  As Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed, the amount of fraud related to stolen coins has increased.  Recently, it was reported that $220 million in coins were stolen and not recovered.  It is hard to track fraudulent activities and those who perpetrate these acts because e-coins are untraceable.  For Bitcoin to work and protect consumers and investors, there needs to be clear legal protection.  This will have to be implemented on a nation-by-nation basis with international cooperation. Without it, unacceptably high risk will persist and limit adoption.   Regulatory Risk
Bitcoin’s rapid price climb and growing visibility has also been its greatest weakness.  In the last month, some of the world’s wealthiest nations have realized there are numerous risks like economic instability that Bitcoin could pose if it is not properly regulated.  There are a growing number of nations that have begun to debunk the idea it could serve as a real currency.  China, the second-largest economy in the world, announced in December that it would not accept Bitcoin, and within 48 hours the price dropped as much as 50 percent. Other influential nations and authorities have also spoken out against Bitcoin, including Denmark,  Finland, France, India, Norway, Sweden, Thailand and the European Banking Authority. Next week, the New York State Department of Financial Services will hold an important hearing to further help clarify the role that Bitcoin should or should not play as it relates to our financial sector. Under this growing regulatory climate and concerns about not being able to prevent money laundering, American commercial banks are hesitant to open accounts with Bitcoin-related start-ups.  Increasingly, the fate of the commercial viability of e-currencies is moving into the hands of nations, their regulators and financial protectors and out of the control of Bitcoin enthusiasts.

279,Bitcoin a Fool’s Gold Standard,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/bitcoin-a-fools-gold-standard/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-22T16:09:50+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"I cannot judge whether Bitcoin represents a technological breakthrough, but I am confident that the pseudocurrency’s popularity shows widespread economic amnesia. If Bitcoin ever became a real currency, it would suffer from the crippling problems of the gold standard. The underlying problem is the belief that Bitcoin’s independence from government is a good thing. This libertarian notion could hardly be more wrong. Money is a common good for the whole society, and in the contemporary world governments are the pre-eminent social guardians. It is true that under dire circumstances people might have to resort to an inferior monetary substitute. If a government collapsed or totally trashed the monetary system, then some privately issued money could be the least bad alternative. In such apocalyptic times, though, a software protocol that relies on secure electronic communications would not be first choice. Gold, which is tangible and not subject to hacking, is more plausible. So are old baseball cards. But for the sake of argument, assume that Bitcoin or something like it did actually become the leading currency in a monetary dystopia. People would learn soon enough why nongovernment money works badly. Deflation is an obvious issue. Price declines are inevitable when a finite supply of Bitcoin money, a feature of the software, meets an expanding supply of purchased goods and services. That would be uncomfortable. Consumers might delay purchases as they wait for prices to fall, workers might chafe at regular annual wage cuts, and creditors would be even worse off. But in itself, deflation does not discredit nongovernment money. People and banks could adjust to the new monetary reality, as the Japanese have to the country’s 0.3 percent average annual decline in consumer prices since 1998. Alternatively, a different nondeflationary electronic currency could be created; one which added steadily to the supply of money. If the addition was in line with gross domestic product growth, prices and wages could be roughly flat in normal times. Yet times are not always normal, and neither Bitcoin nor some putative “growcoin” — nor any sort of limited-supply money – can cope with unexpected bad news. Historians of money know the story well. Before governments started to issue money purely by fiat, the supply of money was limited by the supply of gold or silver, supplemented by public or private notes that were theoretically backed by some valuable asset. Whenever people decided to hoard their hard currency and reject paper notes, there was trouble. The spur to the monetary fear might be war, crop failure or a busted financial institution. Whatever the cause, the sudden increase in caution automatically created a sudden decrease in the money for spending. The economic theorists of hard money said that wages and prices would also fall automatically, so the shrunken supply of currency would still be adequate to keep the economy running. In practice, the adjustment was always much too slow. Goods became unaffordable, unemployment rose and production fell. The British economist John Maynard Keynes called it the paradox of thrift. He was analyzing the Great Depression of the 1930s, the last big money-prodded general decline. Keynes taught, and the world learned, that governments could and should counter bad news by ensuring that there was always enough money available to keep spending constant. As the slow recovery from the 2008 recession shows, the policies have not always worked perfectly. But they could not work at all in a Bitcoin economy, because there would be no authority that could decide how much new money to print. Indeed, the knowledge that governments could not create new Bitcoins in a crisis would only increase thrift. Just as in the 19th century, a little bit of bad news would spawn a large economic crisis. The problem would be worse now than then, because the economy relies so much more on bank-created credit. Whether banks use dollars, euros or Bitcoins, they lend out most of their deposits. The loans increase the supply of spendable money, because the lent sum is added to the total while the deposits that fund the loans are not subtracted. The arrangement is always potentially unstable. If the borrowers cannot repay too many of the loans or if depositors want to withdraw their money too fast, the bank may fall short of funds. A failure, and an ensuing panic, can only be avoided if banks can find cash elsewhere. The ultimate “elsewhere” is always the government, which can create new funds out of thin air. Government rescues are not ideal, but better than any known alternative. In a Bitcoin or growcoin world, the government would have nothing to offer. Frequent bank runs and financial panics would be unavoidable. Charitably, the popular interest in Bitcoin can be interpreted as a sign of ignorance of economic history. More realistically, it is a sad statement of a loss of faith in a monetary system that has not worked as well as promised. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is no more than a high-tech version of an even worse system.

280,Why Bitcoin Matters,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-bitcoin-matters/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-21T16:54:30+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"
 Editor’s note: Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested just under $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. The firm is actively searching for more Bitcoin-based investment opportunities. He does not personally own more than a de minimis amount of Bitcoin. A mysterious new technology emerges, seemingly out of nowhere, but actually the result of two decades of intense research and development by nearly anonymous researchers. Political idealists project visions of liberation and revolution onto it; establishment elites heap contempt and scorn on it. On the other hand, technologists – nerds – are transfixed by it. They see within it enormous potential and spend their nights and weekends tinkering with it. Eventually mainstream products, companies and industries emerge to commercialize it; its effects become profound; and later, many people wonder why its powerful promise wasn’t more obvious from the start. What technology am I talking about? Personal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993, and – I believe – Bitcoin in 2014. One can hardly accuse Bitcoin of being an uncovered topic, yet the gulf between what the press and many regular people believe Bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe Bitcoin is, remains enormous. In this post, I will explain why Bitcoin has so many Silicon Valley programmers and entrepreneurs all lathered up, and what I think Bitcoin’s future potential is. First, Bitcoin at its most fundamental level is a breakthrough in computer science – one that builds on 20 years of research into cryptographic currency, and 40 years of research in cryptography, by thousands of researchers around the world. Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem. To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: “[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.”   More generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet. The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate. What kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds … and digital money. All these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want. How does this work? Bitcoin is an Internet-wide distributed ledger. You buy into the ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots, either with cash or by selling a product and service for Bitcoin. You sell out of the ledger by trading your Bitcoin to someone else who wants to buy into the ledger. Anyone in the world can buy into or sell out of the ledger any time they want – with no approval needed, and with no or very low fees. The Bitcoin “coins” themselves are simply slots in the ledger, analogous in some ways to seats on a stock exchange, except much more broadly applicable to real world transactions. The Bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world can pay anyone else in the world any amount of value of Bitcoin by simply transferring ownership of the corresponding slot in the ledger. Put value in, transfer it, the recipient gets value out, no authorization required, and in many cases, no fees. That last part is enormously important. Bitcoin is the first Internetwide payment system where transactions either happen with no fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent – and that’s in the developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern payment systems or the rates are significantly higher. We’ll come back to that. Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument. It is a way to exchange money or assets between parties with no pre-existing trust: A string of numbers is sent over email or text message in the simplest case. The sender doesn’t need to know or trust the receiver or vice versa. Related, there are no chargebacks – this is the part that is literally like cash – if you have the money or the asset, you can pay with it; if you don’t, you can’t. This is brand new. This has never existed in digital form before. Bitcoin is a digital currency, whose value is based directly on two things: use of the payment system today – volume and velocity of payments running through the ledger – and speculation on future use of the payment system. This is one part that is confusing people. It’s not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; it’s more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value. It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible. The Bitcoin currency had to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is the classic “chicken and egg” problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it’s worth a lot. And so the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value in part because of speculation is making the reality of its usefulness arrive much faster than it would have otherwise. Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it’s not. The criticism that merchants will not accept Bitcoin because of its volatility is also incorrect. Bitcoin can be used entirely as a payment system; merchants do not need to hold any Bitcoin currency or be exposed to Bitcoin volatility at any time. Any consumer or merchant can trade in and out of Bitcoin and other currencies any time they want. Why would any merchant – online or in the real world – want to accept Bitcoin as payment, given the currently small number of consumers who want to pay with it? My partner Chris Dixon recently gave this example: “Let’s say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That’s money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice. Another challenge merchants have with payments is accepting international payments. If you are wondering why your favorite product or service isn’t available in your country, the answer is often payments.” In addition, merchants are highly attracted to Bitcoin because it eliminates the risk of credit card fraud. This is the form of fraud that motivates so many criminals to put so much work into stealing personal customer information and credit card numbers. Since Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument, the receiver of a payment does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future, either by that merchant or by a criminal who steals that information from the merchant. Credit card fraud is such a big deal for merchants, credit card processors and banks that online fraud detection systems are hair-trigger wired to stop transactions that look even slightly suspicious, whether or not they are actually fraudulent. As a result, many online merchants are forced to turn away 5 to 10 percent of incoming orders that they could take without fear if the customers were paying with Bitcoin, where such fraud would not be possible. Since these are orders that were coming in already, they are inherently the highest margin orders a merchant can get, and so being able to take them will drastically increase many merchants’ profit margins. Bitcoin’s antifraud properties even extend into the physical world of retail stores and shoppers. For example, with Bitcoin, the huge hack that recently stole 70 million consumers’ credit card information from the Target department store chain would not have been possible. Here’s how that would work: You fill your cart and go to the checkout station like you do now. But instead of handing over your credit card to pay, you pull out your smartphone and take a snapshot of a QR code displayed by the cash register. The QR code contains all the information required for you to send Bitcoin to Target, including the amount. You click “Confirm” on your phone and the transaction is done (including converting dollars from your account into Bitcoin, if you did not own any Bitcoin). Target is happy because it has the money in the form of Bitcoin, which it can immediately turn into dollars if it wants, and it paid no or very low payment processing fees; you are happy because there is no way for hackers to steal any of your personal information; and organized crime is unhappy. (Well, maybe criminals are still happy: They can try to steal money directly from poorly-secured merchant computer systems. But even if they succeed, consumers bear no risk of loss, fraud or identity theft.) Finally, I’d like to address the claim made by some critics that Bitcoin is a haven for bad behavior, for criminals and terrorists to transfer money anonymously with impunity. This is a myth, fostered mostly by sensationalistic press coverage and an incomplete understanding of the technology. Much like email, which is quite traceable, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Further, every transaction in the Bitcoin network is tracked and logged forever in the Bitcoin blockchain, or permanent record, available for all to see. As a result, Bitcoin is considerably easier for law enforcement to trace than cash, gold or diamonds. What’s the future of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology. Bitcoin shares this network effect property with the telephone system, the web, and popular Internet services like eBay and Facebook. In fact, Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect. There are four constituencies that participate in expanding the value of Bitcoin as a consequence of their own self-interested participation. Those constituencies are (1) consumers who pay with Bitcoin, (2) merchants who accept Bitcoin, (3) “miners” who run the computers that process and validate all the transactions and enable the distributed trust network to exist, and (4) developers and entrepreneurs who are building new products and services with and on top of Bitcoin. All four sides of the network effect are playing a valuable part in expanding the value of the overall system, but the fourth is particularly important. All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs – not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry – building companies on top of Bitcoin. For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance. One immediately obvious and enormous area for Bitcoin-based innovation is international remittance. Every day, hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in hard jobs in foreign countries to make money to send back to their families in their home countries – over $400 billion in total annually, according to the World Bank. Every day, banks and payment companies extract mind-boggling fees, up to 10 percent and sometimes even higher, to send this money. Switching to Bitcoin, which charges no or very low fees, for these remittance payments will therefore raise the quality of life of migrant workers and their families significantly. In fact, it is hard to think of any one thing that would have a faster and more positive effect on so many people in the world’s poorest countries. Moreover, Bitcoin generally can be a powerful force to bring a much larger number of people around the world into the modern economic system. Only about 20 countries around the world have what we would consider to be fully modern banking and payment systems; the other roughly 175 have a long way to go. As a result, many people in many countries are excluded from products and services that we in the West take for granted. Even Netflix, a completely virtual service, is only available in about 40 countries. Bitcoin, as a global payment system anyone can use from anywhere at any time, can be a powerful catalyst to extend the benefits of the modern economic system to virtually everyone on the planet. And even here in the United States, a long-recognized problem is the extremely high fees that the “unbanked” — people without conventional bank accounts – pay for even basic financial services. Bitcoin can be used to go straight at that problem, by making it easy to offer extremely low-fee services to people outside of the traditional financial system. A third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments. Micropayments have never been feasible, despite 20 years of attempts, because it is not cost effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable. All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that’s trivially easy. Bitcoins have the nifty property of infinite divisibility: currently down to eight decimal places after the dot, but more in the future. So you can specify an arbitrarily small amount of money, like a thousandth of a penny, and send it to anyone in the world for free or near-free. Think about content monetization, for example. One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner ads everywhere on the web). All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, there is an economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive access, or per news alert. Another potential use of Bitcoin micropayments is to fight spam. Future email systems and social networks could refuse to accept incoming messages unless they were accompanied with tiny amounts of Bitcoin – tiny enough to not matter to the sender, but large enough to deter spammers, who today can send uncounted billions of spam messages for free with impunity. Finally, a fourth interesting use case is public payments. This idea first came to my attention in a news article a few months ago. A random spectator at a televised sports event held up a placard with a QR code and the text “Send me Bitcoin!” He received $25,000 in Bitcoin in the first 24 hours, all from people he had never met. This was the first time in history that you could see someone holding up a sign, in person or on TV or in a photo, and then send them money with two clicks on your smartphone: take the photo of the QR code on the sign, and click to send the money. Think about the implications for protest movements. Today protesters want to get on TV so people learn about their cause. Tomorrow they’ll want to get on TV because that’s how they’ll raise money, by literally holding up signs that let people anywhere in the world who sympathize with them send them money on the spot. Bitcoin is a financial technology dream come true for even the most hardened anticapitalist political organizer. The coming years will be a period of great drama and excitement revolving around this new technology. For example, some prominent economists are deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, even though Ben S. Bernanke, formerly Federal Reserve chairman, recently wrote that digital currencies like Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if they promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” And in 1999, the legendary economist Milton Friedman said: “One thing that’s missing but will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A – the way I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you, and you may get that without knowing who I am.”   Economists who attack Bitcoin today might be correct, but I’m with Ben and Milton. Further, there is no shortage of regulatory topics and issues that will have to be addressed, since almost no country’s regulatory framework for banking and payments anticipated a technology like Bitcoin. But I hope that I have given you a sense of the enormous promise of Bitcoin. Far from a mere libertarian fairy tale or a simple Silicon Valley exercise in hype, Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike.",0.09148320610687023,0.09919555521722916

Employees at the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco library heard a crashing sound and rushed to the science fiction section, expecting to find a patron had hit the floor. Instead, they found a handful of federal agents surrounding a slender 29-year-old man with light brown hair and wearing a T-shirt and jeans. The goal of the arrest, at 3:15 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, was not simply to apprehend Mr. Ulbricht, but also to prevent him from performing the most mundane of tasks: closing his laptop. That computer, according to the F.B.I., was the command center of Silk Road, the world’s largest and most notorious black market for drugs. In just two and a half years, the government says, Silk Road had become a hub for more than $1.2 billion worth of transactions, many of them in cocaine, heroin and LSD.  The site was like an eBay for the illicit, celebrated by drug enthusiasts, denounced by United States senators and stalked by four federal agencies. But because it was run on Tor, an encrypted Internet network, and because it merely connected buyers and sellers — rather than warehousing any products — it seemed to operate in a vaporous cloud. It was a business without infrastructure, other than a few servers and that laptop, which on 3:14 that October afternoon sat on a library desk, open. Had Mr. Ulbricht seen the F.B.I. coming, and simply closed the laptop, password protections probably would have kicked in, turning the hard drive into what Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, called “an encrypted lump” that would have been “tougher to break into than Fort Knox.” Whatever tactics were used — the F.B.I. would not comment — they worked. Mr. Ulbricht was administering Silk Road when he was grabbed, the bureau said in a criminal complaint, and working under an alias, Dread Pirate Roberts, the name of a swashbuckling character from the novel and film “The Princess Bride.”  The government later released screen photographs showing that Mr. Ulbricht was logged into a page titled “mastermind.” According to the government, operational files were found, including ledgers that tallied personal revenue of 600,000 Bitcoins, the crypto-currency used for every Silk Road transaction, a stash that, at the time, was worth $80 million. A criminal complaint laid out the charges, which included narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. An indictment in a parallel but separate investigation, run out of Baltimore, included this startling detail: Some of Dread Pirate Roberts’s booty was spent to commission killings — six killings in total, to be done by hit men whose targets were deemed by Dread Pirate Roberts to threaten Silk Road.  None of the orders resulted in actual deaths, the authorities said. One, in fact, was an elaborate fiction concocted by a federal agent posing as a drug dealer. In a scene that sounds as if it were lifted from “Breaking Bad,” federal agents traveled to Utah to fake a beating and execution, sending the evidently grisly photographs to D.P.R., as the government calls him in its complaint. “What’s done is done,” D.P.R. would later write to the putative dealer.  News of Mr. Ulbricht’s arrest, and the particulars of the crimes with which he was charged, elicited the inevitable chorus of “They’ve got the wrong guy” from friends and relatives, an almost clichéd feature of double-life cases. But this chorus was different. Sure, Mr. Ulbricht took his share of drugs growing up in Austin, Tex. And a high school buddy, Thomas Haney, said he could sort of imagine Ross buying from Silk Road. But running it? Ordering killings? No way.  “It’d be like they accused my mother of trying to kill someone,” said Mr. Haney, who now lives in Boise, Idaho. “He’s one of the most guileless and nonaggressive people I’ve ever met.” A man who shared a house with Mr. Ulbricht in San Francisco for two months remembers how he rushed to help an elderly homeless woman in a wheelchair. “We were standing outside a restaurant, and he just handed me the leash to my dogs, ran into the street and said, ‘Can I help you?’ ” said the man, who, like many people interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want his name in an article about this case. “And he didn’t wait for an answer.” Far from the bloodless kingpin portrayed by the government, Ross Ulbricht, by the accounts of friends and relatives, was soulful and sensitive. In a conversation with his childhood friend Rene Pinnell, recorded in 2012 through StoryCorps, a national oral history project, and still posted on YouTube, Mr. Ulbricht said that in college he initially refused to sleep with the woman he described as his first love, for fear that he would wind up heartsick. “We didn’t have sex for like three months,” he said. “But we’d make out, and really, like, get close but never go there. And when we finally did, it was amazing.” It seems nearly impossible to reconcile the government’s version of Mr. Ulbricht with the warm, compassionate person that others describe. Which leaves at least three possibilities.  One, that the government has, in fact, collared the wrong man.  Two, that Mr. Ulbricht is a sociopath who concealed a dark side from everyone for years. Three, that Mr. Ulbricht is Dread Pirate Roberts — and that the two are not really that different. A Trusted Emporium By relying on Bitcoin and an encrypted Internet network, Silk Road created an anonymous bazaar where drugs could be bought from the comfort of home. No more drives to seedy parts of town, no more face-to-face encounters with shady dealers. Instead, transactions would be conducted through the mail, and, in what many academics regard as the linchpin to the business-model innovation, Dread Pirate Roberts devised a system to ensure that nobody got fleeced.  The site acted as an intermediary, hosting the online market and holding money in escrow until buyers confirmed that products had arrived. D.P.R. would then release the payment to the seller, keeping 8 to 15 percent of the transaction. “He had basically commoditized security,” says Nicolas Christin, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied Silk Road. “It was a system that allowed people to buy drugs without fear that they would be ripped off.” Within months of its start in January 2011, the site was thriving. Sellers posted photographs and descriptions of their products, like “10 x 10mg OxyContin” and “5G Pure Cocaine Cristal.” A guide offered tips for newcomers. Vacuum-sealed packages were recommended for anyone mailing narcotics to avoid detection by “canine or electronic sniffers,” and post office boxes were urged for buyers. Reviews were posted, just like on eBay. “Perfect stealth and perfect dope to match,” gushed a customer of a merchant known as “gotsitall,” who sold what was billed as high-quality heroin. “Got product in less than 24 hours! Thanks again.” A small staff was hired to respond to users and settle disputes. These employees, none of whom knew the identity of Dread Pirate Roberts, were paid between $1,000 and $2,000 a week in Bitcoins. By June 2011, the site was attracting enough buzz to merit a post on Gawker, which called it “the underground website where you can buy any drug imaginable.” Soon, Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia were demanding that the Justice Department close Silk Road. But the site had only begun to catch on. An inventory taken by the F.B.I. one day last September found 13,000 listings for controlled substances, in categories that included opioids, psychedelics and ecstasy. A “services” section with 159 offerings included a tutorial on hacking automated teller machines. More than 800 listings offered “digital goods,” such as hacked Netflix accounts, and 169 listings in “forgeries,” including driver’s licenses and car insurance records. Anyone with minimal computer literacy could access this superstore of criminal mischief. Users needed only to install software for Tor, a network that hides I.P. addresses and bundles communications in layers of encryption. Type in Silk Road’s ungainly address, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion, and you entered the market. Acquire Bitcoins, through exchanges such as Mt.Gox, and you could start shopping. ‘Execute Rather Than Torture’ The system made D.P.R. a cybermultimillionaire. But accumulating that wealth came with its share of management migraines. One of the biggest involved an employee named Curtis Clark Green, a burly man whose colorful past includes a stint as a semipro poker player and charges of prescription fraud. From his home in Spanish Fork, Utah, the government said, he sold drugs on Silk Road under the name “chronicpain,” and eventually he built enough trust with D.P.R. to become one of his lieutenants. In early December 2012, D.P.R. needed Mr. Green for a special task. A dealer who operated under the alias “nob” had complained that Silk Road transactions were too small to be worth his time. Mr. Green was to find someone willing to play in the same league. “Hey, I think we have a buyer for you,” D.P.R. subsequently wrote to nob. “One of my staff is sending details.” Nob, however, was not a dealer. He was a member of Operation Marco Polo, a task force based in Baltimore that was named for the explorer who followed the Silk Road and that included agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations. (No one from any of the investigating agencies would comment on the case.) When Mr. Green helped nob arrange the sale of a kilogram of cocaine, in early 2012, he did something that is hard to explain: he offered to act as a conduit and have the cocaine sent to his house. Mr. Green was soon arrested. He was quickly released and the kilogram was sent, as planned, to the buyer, presumably to prevent D.P.R. from realizing that one of his underlings had been caught. Dread Pirate Roberts did somehow learn of the arrest, but he still didn’t realize he was communicating with a federal agent who had arranged it. He was soon fuming to nob that Mr. Green had absconded with Bitcoins, and D.P.R. asked for help. “I’d like him beat up, then forced to send the Bitcoins he stole back,” D.P.R. wrote. “Like sit him down at his computer and make him do it.” Soon, D.P.R. had a change of heart. “Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?” he asked nob, explaining, “I’m afraid he’ll give up info.” Nob told D.P.R. that he knew “pros” who could get the job done. The cost was $40,000 in Bitcoins up front, and $40,000 after the killing. Dread Pirate Roberts agreed to the price but wanted “proof of death,” asking nob to instruct the killers to send a video, “and if they can’t do that, then pictures” of the deceased.  Only the broad outlines are known of what must have been a highly cinematic dumb show of violence. What is clear from the criminal complaint is that by Feb. 21, nob sent photos of Mr. Green doing a fine impression of a corpse. Mr. Green had “died of asphyxiation/heart rupture” while being tortured, nob explained. Dread Pirate Roberts replied that he found the images disturbing, but that he did not have any other choice.  “I just wish more people had some integrity,” D.P.R. wrote. In the months that followed, D.P.R. would pay a supposed hit man named “redandwhite” $150,000 in Bitcoins to whack a blackmailer who was threatening to release the identities of Silk Road users, and later a seller who appears to have scammed buyers en masse. When redandwhite noted that the scammer lived with three roommates, D.P.R. was persuaded to kill all four of them, at a cost of $500,000. The government contends that the whole enterprise was likely a swindle. Whether these targets were in cahoots with redandwhite, or were the creation of redandwhite, is not clear. But authorities in Canada, where all five killings were supposed to have taken place, found no trace of crimes that matched redandwhite’s descriptions, according to federal prosecutors.  Nonetheless, D.P.R.’s willingness to underwrite killings would become an argument against bail, which was presented in November by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, where Ross Ulbricht was transferred soon after his arrest. (The F.B.I. ran its case out of Manhattan.) Today, Mr. Ulbricht awaits trial in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.  The Forgiving Kind  Lyn Ulbricht, Mr. Ulbricht’s mother, sat one recent morning in the downtown Manhattan office of her son’s lawyer. She had flown in from Austin a few days earlier, to look for a place where she and her husband could live to be close to their son.  “I can’t be somewhere else while he’s in jail,” she said. “We want to visit him. We believe in him, so that’s what we’re going to do.” Ross Ulbricht grew up in a suburb of Austin that his mother described as the poorest neighborhood in a good school district. She and her husband, Kirk, earn most of their income renting four beachside vacation houses they own in Costa Rica. Ross is remembered by friends as bright, though not whiz-kid bright, part of a circle that mostly avoided the football culture that dominated high school.  “He was outdoorsy,” said James McFarland, who met Mr. Ulbricht in a physics class. “We played a lot of ultimate Frisbee, hiking, swimming, that sort of thing.” Mr. McFarland and others say he was shy around girls, sweet-natured, loyal to friends and a fan of intense philosophical conversations. He was also an unusual combination of rule follower and rule breaker. He did a lot of drugs, as he explained in that StoryCorps conversation, likening his intake to a guy who jumped into the deep end of a pool and stayed underwater for as long as he could hold his breath. At the same time, he collected enough merit badges to become that emblem of teenage all-Americanness, an Eagle Scout. By the time he went to the University of Texas at Dallas, on a full academic scholarship, he was 6-foot-2, a lean, good-looking guy who could have fronted an indie rock band. But he was the opposite of a Lothario. He was vulnerable and eager to find a soul mate, and fell hard for that college girlfriend. The two were engaged, according to Thomas Haney, but it ended when Ross learned that she had cheated with one of his closest buddies. “I’d have killed the guy, but Ross completely forgave him within a year of it happening,” Mr. Haney said. That was Ross’s style, not just willing to forgive, but empathetic to the point of mushy. At a bachelor party held in the woods two years ago for a friend named Daniel, Mr. Haney said, everyone was sitting around, kind of stumped about what to do.  “Then Ross pipes up,” Mr. Haney said, “and he said, ‘Let’s go around in a circle and say why we love Daniel.’ ” After graduating in 2006 with a degree in physics, Mr. Ulbricht headed to Penn State, where he earned a master’s degree in material sciences and engineering. His thesis, “Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,” is still available at the school’s online archives.  He later returned to Austin and was a co-founder of Good Wagon Books, which collected used books from around the city and sold them online, donating 10 percent of profits to charities. But the venture failed, and Mr. Ulbricht started what he described to acquaintances as a hedge fund, trading stocks and currencies, including Bitcoin. Friends had the impression that it was not going well, especially after other people started to give him money to invest, which made him overly cautious. At the invitation of Mr. Pinnell, Mr. Ulbricht relocated to San Francisco in 2012. When Mr. Pinnell became engaged, Mr. Ulbricht moved into a group house, where he told roommates that his name was Joshua Terrey, according to an article in Forbes. In August, two months before he was arrested, he abruptly left that house for another, without explanation.  His new accommodations were hardly those of a drug lord. He paid $1,100 a month for a 12-by-14-foot room, sharing a house with three roommates. One of those roommates said that they knew him by his real name and that he told them he earned a living by building and managing websites.  Nothing about him seemed out of the ordinary, until he was arrested. That day, his roommates returned to their house to find a search warrant left by the F.B.I. on the coffee table in the living room. “The F.B.I. came back a bunch of times and asked questions for hours,” the roommate said. “We were in shock. It really was about a week before I felt normal.” Nine Fake IDs How did the F.B.I. connect Dread Pirate Roberts to Ross Ulbricht? That is still a mystery. Mr. Ulbricht certainly left more than a few digital crumbs, according to the government’s complaint and a variety of online rubberneckers who followed the case. The first mention of Silk Road online, in January 2011, by someone called “altoid,” was followed a few months later by a user with the same alias on a Bitcoin Talk forum. This person was searching for an I.T. pro for hire. Applicants were asked to email “rossulbricht at gmail dot com.”  But this was only enough to make Mr. Ulbricht a person of interest. In July 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package from Canada bound for his address. The package contained nine fake IDs, each bearing a photograph of Mr. Ulbricht and a different name, with addresses in a variety of states and countries.  On July 26, agents of Homeland Security Investigations knocked on the door of Mr. Ulbricht’s group house. “Josh,” as he then was calling himself, refused to answer most of the agents’ questions, the government would say later.  Though Mr. Ulbricht did not take the opportunity to skedaddle, he apparently had considered it. The government would say later that his laptop contained a filled-out application for “economic citizenship” in Dominica, a Caribbean island. The price was a one-time donation of $75,000 to the country’s government. The crucial breakthrough in the case occurred a few weeks after that fake ID package was intercepted. The F.B.I. located and copied the contents of Silk Road’s main servers, the computers that powered the site’s operations and stored its data. It is here that the government’s otherwise detailed account gets fuzzy. The F.B.I. has stated only that the main server was found in “a certain foreign country,” one that has a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States. Through the treaty, the F.B.I. was given a copy of the server — a “mirror” of it, in tech terms — on July 23. The site continued to operate, so D.P.R. would not be spooked. What is unclear is how the feds knew where the servers were. Presumably, they were rented in some faraway corners of the globe — Iceland, Latvia and Romania are likely, according to experts who have studied the I.P. addresses. But the official vagueness has provoked speculation in academic circles and among security specialists. Was the National Security Agency involved? Did this process involve breaking laws, or violating constitutional rights? That issue will be at the heart of Ross Ulbricht’s defense strategy, says Joshua L. Dratel, his lawyer, whose clients include a Guantánamo detainee.“It’s called the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine,” Mr. Dratel explained. “If you think of the acquisitions of evidence as a chain, if you find one bad link, everything on the other side of that link is suppressible.” In other words, if Mr. Dratel can prove that the government acted improperly when it found and copied that server, all the evidence it gathered after that — including the laptop taken in that Oct. 1 arrest — could be tossed out of court. Mr. Dratel said he would also argue that Mr. Ulbricht is not Dread Pirate Roberts. But that contention could be hard to square with a sworn statement by Mr. Ulbricht, filed with the court Dec. 12. It says the Bitcoins seized from the laptop should be returned to him, because he “has an interest as an owner/possessor” of the money.  This seems a tricky needle for Mr. Ulbricht to thread. He is denying that he is Dread Pirate Roberts but demanding what the government maintains is D.P.R.’s money. How did Mr. Ulbricht earn millions in virtual dollars, if not through Silk Road commissions? Mr. Dratel declined to say, citing a reluctance to discuss the facts of the case. ‘A Revolution of Epic Proportions’ The 2012 StoryCorps video ends with Rene Pinnell asking where Mr. Ulbricht hopes to be in 20 years. “Twenty years, uh,” says Mr. Ulbricht, tugging at his facial hair and looking sideways. After a pause, he looks directly at Mr. Pinnell and says, “I want to have had a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity by that time.” Mr. Pinnell laughs, because that sounds so ambitious that it initially comes across as a joke. But Mr. Ulbricht isn’t laughing. “Do you think you’re going to live forever?” Mr. Pinnell asks, getting serious. “I think it’s a possibility,” says Mr. Ulbricht, allowing a grin. Again, his friend chuckles. “I honestly do,” Mr. Ulbricht says with a smile. “I think I might live forever in some form, by that time. I mean technology is changing so fast.” Mr. Pinnell does not pose the obvious follow-up — what are you talking about? How exactly do you plan to transition from day trader-with-a-laptop to historical figure? None of Mr. Ulbricht’s friends, it seems, had an answer for that one, perhaps because they didn’t know enough about his interior life.  Most grasped that he’d long been a searcher, a restless mind rummaging around for a philosophy. For years, he was fascinated by Eastern mysticism, and briefly was an advocate of the Landmark Forum, a three-day seminar intended to give participants “the power to make what you’re committed to into a reality,” as the company’s website says. What few friends realized is where his philosophical quest had brought him. At Penn State, he was becoming a dedicated libertarian. He joined the school’s Libertarian Club and wore a Ron Paul for President shirt to classes. Mr. Ulbricht was quoted in the school’s newspaper, The Daily Collegian, saying of Mr. Paul, “there’s a lot to learn from him and his message of what it means to be a U.S. citizen and what it means to be a free individual.” By the time Mr. Ulbricht left Penn State, his views had taken on a vehemently anti-tax tone. A friend in Austin said Mr. Ulbricht’s politics at the time were more “hard core” than his own. “I’d say ‘Less government but we need the government to build roads,’ ” this friend said. “But for him, even when it came to building roads, he felt there ought to be a voluntary basis for that. The point for him wasn’t to abolish government. He just thought people should have the ability to opt out of paying taxes.” These views weren’t a secret. Not long after graduating from Penn State, he wrote on his LinkedIn page that his interest in physics had waned. “Now, my goals have shifted,” he wrote. “I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind.” Institutions and government were the problem, he continued. Which is why he was “creating an economic simulation to give people a firsthand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.” Was Silk Road that economic simulation? Without question, Dread Pirate Roberts considered the site a means to “abolish the use of coercion.” He routinely proclaimed so, in postings that sound like a mash-up of manifesto and infomercial. “I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive,” D.P.R. wrote on Silk Road in March 2012. “Now it is profitable to throw off one’s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically. How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets? The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!” Dread Pirate Roberts considered his work epochal because he was not just promoting the sale of illicit goods. He was reimagining the fundamentals of commerce. For centuries, consumers have been taxed by governments or overlords of one type or another, rendering unto Caesar for as long as there have been Caesars. But if Silk Road were scalable, that era was over. Or at least imperiled. Anyone would have the option to sell goods undisturbed by regulations and without sharing a percentage of revenue with the state. And why stop at drugs? The system would work for legal products, too. The tools are there for a kind of subterranean Amazon.com. “It could literally change the world as we know it,” D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road in an online exhortation. A man who created a website that changed the world as we know it could believe he had a chance to live forever. At minimum, he could be a hero to anyone who thinks that government has no business in business. Ross Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts have other similarities, including a fondness for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, part of the Austrian School of Economics, which was celebrated by Mr. Ulbricht on his Google+ page and by D.P.R. in Silk Road pep talks.  This could be a coincidence. It could also be a coincidence that neither man nor pseudonym seemed motivated by greed. Mr. Ulbricht’s lifestyle was one notch above that of urban couch surfer. And the primary goal that D.P.R. professed was to unshackle humanity from what he regarded as economic tyranny. If a handful of miscreants — and yes, a few of their unfortunate roommates — were killed along the way, that is a shame. But Silk Road was like a tunnel under the gulag, and D.P.R. was digging for the sake of humanity. “It needs everything we have,” D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road, urging buyers and sellers to grasp its significance. “Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.” Perhaps this is where Dread Pirate Roberts, the criminal mastermind, overlaps with Ross Ulbricht, the guy who aided a homeless woman in a wheelchair. With aching sincerity, they both really wanted to help. Roads Closed? The success of Silk Road raised the prospect that the thuggish street drug dealer, the stock character of countless police procedurals, could be replaced by a geek in a coffee shop with a laptop. But in the months since Silk Road was shut down, several sites have tried to takes its place and all have failed. One of them, called the Sheep Marketplace, went dark in December, as users howled that administrators had made off with as much as $44 million in Bitcoins. Project: Black Flag lasted a few weeks in October, before its leader announced, “I was unable to cope with the stress and constant demand, so I panicked.” Metta Dread Pirate Roberts, as that site’s fearful leader was known, then absconded with an unknown sum of Bitcoins, according to news reports. “I suspect that the online drug marketplace is a passing fad because it’s too traceable, too vulnerable to hacking,” said Mr. Weaver at the International Computer Science Institute. Once Bitcoins are converted to another currency, the government can subpoena the records of the exchange where the transaction took place and harvest all the information it needs. “Bitcoin isn’t really a ‘coin’ as much as a distributed, public balance ledger,” Mr. Weaver added, “with every balance and transaction recorded.” Hence Bitcoin’s wry new nickname in legal circles: “Prosecution Futures.” The government has begun making arrests: Olivia Bolles, a Delaware doctor, was charged in November with selling oxycodone, Xanax and other drugs on Silk Road, stuffing Sour Patch and Jolly Rancher candy in the packages to thwart detection.  But the limits of technology are only part of the reason that another Silk Road is unlikely anytime soon. To function, such a site needs a leader who is dedicated to the point of fanaticism, and, more important, has a strange kind of integrity. Dread Pirate Roberts did not take the Bitcoin and run because he was a true believer first and an outlaw second. He was a rare set of contradictions, a humanitarian willing to kill, a criminal with a strict code of ethics.",0.010176507936507932,0.029007551898424917
282,Five Lessons From Bitcoin,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/five-lessons-from-bitcoin/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2014-01-08T17:02:57+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Bitcoin is not over yet. But the pseudo-currency is close enough to collapse to merit an early retrospective. My prediction is controversial. Many fervent fans are convinced that this government-free currency is for real. Their ardor may keep it going for a while, but equally Bitcoin could disappear quickly — that’s the way with speculative bubbles. So now is the moment to learn some economic lessons before the whole phenomenon is forgotten. Here are five: Money Without Government Appeals to People Without Law Legal tender has the backing of the issuing state. The government has a proprietary interest in maintaining a reliable currency. It also has the necessary powers to do so. It can regulate lending institutions, pursue fraud and create new money to keep the system afloat. Bitcoin has none of that protection. On the contrary, governments are either hostile or hands off. For anyone in the legal economy, the lack of official support is a significant negative. For anyone in the illegal economy, though, the extra-legal status is a positive. Unsurprisingly, the only real business actually to rely on Bitcoin – not merely issue press releases about planning to accept the tokens – has been Silk Road, a now-closed electronic exchange for illegal drugs. Speculative Fever Can Alight on Almost Anything Bitcoin is a pretty unlikely target. After all, the more the value of the would-be currency changes, the less it looks like a real currency, so the more liable it is to lose all value whenever the speculators get tired or wise. David Yermack of New York University’s Stern School of Business explained in a recent paper that the unstable value of Bitcoin – in the last three months, its dollar price has quadrupled, then almost halved and increased by about half – leaves it without two of the three basic attributes of a currency. Bitcoin is neither a relatable store of value nor a helpful unit of account. Mr. Yermack kindly says that Bitcoin satisfies the third attribute: It can be, and occasionally has been, a medium of exchange. But if speculators were thinking clearly, they would stay away from any supposed money that banks don’t accept. After all, banks are involved in almost all exchanges in today’s economies. The Current Monetary System Is Worth Complaining About Bitcoin is the wrong answer to a good question: What can be done to make the monetary system less crazy? After so many banks needed to be rescued in 2008, and after five subsequent years of weird monetary policy, it’s clear that the question is legitimate. Something is badly wrong. People can be excused for thinking that governments, including central banks, have run the money system so poorly that nongovernmental money might be better, but that is the wrong answer. The only practical right answer is to improve the government-run monetary system. Central banks seem to have learned how to reduce consumer price volatility, which was the scourge of the first decades of purely fiat money. Now, the monetary authorities need to figure out how to reduce the volatility of asset prices, credit flows and foreign exchange rates. And the base interest rates should be high enough to give savers a real return. Money Is Misunderstood Admittedly, money is complicated. It is a social token as well as an economic tool. It is a store of value, but its own value shifts constantly. It is considered a safe and solid asset — “like money in the bank” — but banks cannot really promise always to make good on legitimate demands to liquidate accounts. I sympathize with anyone who does not want to try to understand how money works, but monetary ignorance can be dangerous. Many Bitcoin investors will find that out, to their personal cost. The whole economy paid dearly for similar misunderstandings by central bankers and regulators. They did not really consider the risks of speculation and wild credit creation by nongovernmental financial institutions. If they had, there would have been no need afterward to turn so many of them into quasi-governmental financial institutions. Too Much Entrepreneurial Energy Is Wasted Bitcoin is basically idle speculation, but it has inspired a great deal of skilled work. This small business – total value of a mere $100 million a year ago, now about $10 billion – has generated scores of websites and seemingly unlimited quantities of enthusiastic and evangelistic commentary. The original programmer, the producers of new Bitcoins and the creators of a remarkable number of sophisticated Bitcoin exchanges are all are very good. A society in which no project ever attracted this sort of attention, intelligence and ambition would be moribund. The Bitcoin mania shows that ours is still quite alive. But it is a bit discouraging to see so much of what is good in our economy directed to something so misguided.

Alibaba becomes the latest in a growing chorus of governments and businesses to raise questions about Bitcoin, which has seen its value rise dramatically as more people embrace virtual currency. “In the interest of consumer protection, Taobao Marketplace has banned the listing or sale of Bitcoins over the platform,” said Florence Shih, an Alibaba spokeswoman.  Bitcoin wasn’t an accepted form of payment on the website; the vast majority of transactions are processed through Taobao’s Alipay system. But some merchants still offered to accept Bitcoin as payments for their products or sold the virtual currency. The ban goes in effect on Jan. 14. The announcement comes as Alibaba is considering an initial public offering as early as this year. Wall Street is anticipating that the Chinese company could be valued at more than $150 billion. Alibaba’s decision also follows a move by China last month to ban the nation’s banks from accepting Bitcoins as a currency over concerns about potential money laundering and its potential threat to financial stability. In a notice in December, the People’s Bank of China and other agencies said that Bitcoin was “not a currency in the real meaning of the word” but rather was a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency.” The notice went on, “Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.” Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has a limited supply. As a result, the price of those units has increased as investors have bet on a continued growing demand for the virtual currency.",0.0504,0.06867063492063492

Patrick Byrne, the company’s chief executive, said Overstock planned to let online shoppers pay for goods with Bitcoin by June. The retailer is evaluating the services of several third-party firms that facilitate Bitcoin transactions, with the goal of selecting one by mid-January.  If Overstock follows through on the plan, it will become the most prominent retailer to embrace Bitcoin, an electronic currency that initially gained notoriety as a form of payment for black market drug and weapons transactions and as a new craze for currency speculators. Bitcoin has captivated the imaginations of many technology entrepreneurs and investors, who it as a low-cost payment system that could disrupt established players like Visa and MasterCard. But while many of them are forming or funding start-ups to provide different types of Bitcoin services, not many well-known retailers accept it directly.      Mr. Byrne’s decision to take Bitcoin as a form of payment is driven by philosophical reasons more than business ones. In a lengthy voice mail message explaining his plans, Mr. Byrne said “some fraction, tiny now, of the population” currently wanted to transact using a digital currency like Bitcoin.   He appears more intrigued, however, by the idea of supporting a digital currency that is outside the control of any traditional government authority, echoing a libertarian argument that many fans of Bitcoin have made. Mr. Byrne finds the limitations of creating Bitcoins appealing — there is a finite number of Bitcoins that can be made available and they are released at predetermined pace, unlike traditional government currency.  “You want money to be based on something that no government mandarin can wish into existence with the stroke of a pen,” he said.  In October, Mr. Byrne said that Overstock was thinking about accepting Bitcoin, but that it had suspended its plans because of the regulatory uncertainty around the digital currency. While regulators are still grappling with the implications of digital currency, several federal officials said at a Senate hearing in November that they believed digital currencies could operate within existing laws.  Mr. Byrne is a colorful executive who has been known to stake out controversial positions, including against investors he believes manipulated his company’s stock. He also has an unconventional résumé. Once an aspiring professional boxer, Mr. Byrne has a black belt in taekwondo and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford.  One obstacle to mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin may be its wildly fluctuating value, which could scare off consumers. After the value of a single Bitcoin surged to $1,137 in late November, the price has fallen to about $759, deflated largely by a crackdown by Chinese authorities on Bitcoin trading.   Mr. Byrne said Overstock would insulate itself from such fluctuations by using derivatives to hedge the risk from any Bitcoins it holds. Alternately, the retailer may simply convert its Bitcoins to dollars on a nightly basis, he said. ",0.034858620689655166,0.06754552918346023

It’s also a tale of monetary regress — of the strange determination of many people to turn the clock back on centuries of progress. The first money pit is an actual pit — the Porgera open-pit gold mine in Papua New Guinea, one of the world’s top producers. The mine has a terrible reputation for both human rights abuses (rapes, beatings and killings by security personnel) and environmental damage (vast quantities of potentially toxic tailings dumped into a nearby river). But gold prices, while down from their recent peak, are still three times what they were a decade ago, so dig they must. The second money pit is a lot stranger: the Bitcoin mine in Reykjanesbaer, Iceland. Bitcoin is a digital currency that has value because ... well, it’s hard to say exactly why, but for the time being at least people are willing to buy it because they believe other people will be willing to buy it. It is, by design, a kind of virtual gold. And like gold, it can be mined: you can create new bitcoins, but only by solving very complex mathematical problems that require both a lot of computing power and a lot of electricity to run the computers. Hence the location in Iceland, which has cheap electricity from hydropower and an abundance of cold air to cool those furiously churning machines. Even so, a lot of real resources are being used to create virtual objects with no clear use. The third money pit is hypothetical. Back in 1936 the economist John Maynard Keynes argued that increased government spending was needed to restore full employment. But then, as now, there was strong political resistance to any such proposal. So Keynes whimsically suggested an alternative: have the government bury bottles full of cash in disused coal mines, and let the private sector spend its own money to dig the cash back up. It would be better, he agreed, to have the government build roads, ports and other useful things — but even perfectly useless spending would give the economy a much-needed boost. Clever stuff — but Keynes wasn’t finished. He went on to point out that the real-life activity of gold mining was a lot like his thought experiment. Gold miners were, after all, going to great lengths to dig cash out of the ground, even though unlimited amounts of cash could be created at essentially no cost with the printing press. And no sooner was gold dug up than much of it was buried again, in places like the gold vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where hundreds of thousands of gold bars sit, doing nothing in particular. Keynes would, I think, have been sardonically amused to learn how little has changed in the past three generations. Public spending to fight unemployment is still anathema; miners are still spoiling the landscape to add to idle hoards of gold. (Keynes dubbed the gold standard a “barbarous relic.”) Bitcoin just adds to the joke. Gold, after all, has at least some real uses, e.g., to fill cavities; but now we’re burning up resources to create “virtual gold” that consists of nothing but strings of digits. I suspect, however, that Adam Smith would have been dismayed. Smith is often treated as a conservative patron saint, and he did indeed make the original case for free markets. It’s less often mentioned, however, that he also argued strongly for bank regulation — and that he offered a classic paean to the virtues of paper currency. Money, he understood, was a way to facilitate commerce, not a source of national prosperity — and paper money, he argued, allowed commerce to proceed without tying up much of a nation’s wealth in a “dead stock” of silver and gold. So why are we tearing up the highlands of Papua New Guinea to add to our dead stock of gold and, even more bizarrely, running powerful computers 24/7 to add to a dead stock of digits? Talk to gold bugs and they’ll tell you that paper money comes from governments, which can’t be trusted not to debase their currencies. The odd thing, however, is that for all the talk of currency debasement, such debasement is getting very hard to find. It’s not just that after years of dire warnings about runaway inflation, inflation in advanced countries is clearly too low, not too high. Even if you take a global perspective, episodes of really high inflation have become rare. Still, hyperinflation hype springs eternal. Bitcoin seems to derive its appeal from more or less the same sources, plus the added sense that it’s high-tech and algorithmic, so it must be the wave of the future. But don’t let the fancy trappings fool you: What’s really happening is a determined march to the days when money meant stuff you could jingle in your purse. In tropics and tundra alike, we are for some reason digging our way back to the 17th century. ",0.07842631578947368,0.06842038809144073

Two of them, actually. It begins in 2010 — eons ago, in technology time — in Jacksonville, Fla. A software programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz had, to his happy surprise, persuaded someone to accept 10,000 Bitcoins in exchange for two pizzas from Papa John’s. And why not? By Mr. Hanyecz’s reckoning, the Bitcoins he had been “mining” on his computer were worth about 0.003 cent apiece. He got his two pies for $30 of found money. You probably know the rest. Bitcoin, the digital currency that has since captured attention around the world, exploded. By November, it had skyrocketed from a fraction of a penny to $1,242, roughly the price of an ounce of gold. It has been a wild, wild ride: up and down, down and up. Last week, Bitcoin fluctuated — again — as China clamped down. Everyone seems to be wondering what this crazy new thing might mean. The end of government control over money? The start of an international crypto-currency? Mr. Hanyecz, 32, seems to be taking it all in stride. And he has no regrets about those pizzas. “It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Mr. Hanyecz told me. “No one knew it was going to get so big.” The question now, of course, is whether digital currencies like Bitcoin will get even bigger — or collapse if the music stops. A quick recap: Bitcoins are created, or mined, according to a set of algorithms. Essentially, computers solve some math problems and — presto! — generate Bitcoins. The coins are stored in, and traded among, digital wallets. You can buy real things with them, at least from people who accept them, or, as many people seem to be doing, sit on them in hopes the price will keep rising. So your parents were right: Money doesn’t grow on trees. But, it turns out, money does grow on the Internet. Mr. Hanyecz grew his with open-source software. But, per the algorithms, mining Bitcoins becomes more difficult over time. Only about 21 million of them can ever be created — which is why so many people have been chasing after them. Bitcoins are now accepted as payment at almost a thousand retail outlets and websites, including OKCupid, Reddit, and Pizza Rodi in Montreal. But what has really grabbed attention is how volatile the price has been. The value has gyrated wildly. In the last month alone, the Bitcoin market capitalization has swung between $14 billion and $7 billion. But to Bitcoin believers, that really isn’t so surprising. They are taking the long view — the one in which Bitcoin, despite the ups and down, keeps appreciating in value and eventually becomes a serious currency. “People talk about the volatility with surprise, but it’s exactly what you’d expect from a new global asset class whose regulatory landscape is still developing,” Tyler Winklevoss told me. He and his twin brother, Cameron — famous for their involvement in Facebook — have invested heavily in Bitcoin. By some estimates, they own 1 percent of the market. “We have never sold a single Bitcoin — we started buying in the high single digits and we’re in it for the long haul,” Mr. Winklevoss said. “We don’t look at it in terms of day-to-day. We look at in terms of years.” The Winklevosses are hardly the only ones who are bullish on Bitcoin. Bank of America recently put out a report saying Bitcoin has clear potential for growth and “may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers.” Jed McCaleb, creator of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, a sort of Nasdaq for Bitcoin, says there is a possibility the price could hit $30,000 in a few years. Mr. McCaleb sold the exchange to a Japanese Bitcoin firm in 2011. Mark Williams of Boston University has insisted that the value of a Bitcoin will pop, falling as low $10 next year. Others say it is all just another bubble. Which is why this whole will-it-go-up, will-it-go-down business misses the point. The real question is not what Bitcoin will be worth next week or next month. It is whether digital currencies like this have promise and, if so, how they could change our world. Digital currencies — whether Bitcoin or something else — could make it cheaper and easier to move money around. “While there are questions about the future of Bitcoin, there is clearly going to be a digital currency that can be used for remittances, micro payments, and across borders,” said Susan Athey, a professor of economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “In today’s system you see a number of different kinds of commerce not taking place because the fees are too high relative to the transactions.” With small transactions, the cost to send money can be more expensive than the actual money people are spending. People are charged credit card fees, transfer fees and other expenses that all go to a middle man. This is why there are no 10 cent apps on the app store, many companies try to clump small transactions together online. With virtual currencies, in comparison, there is no middle man. With Bitcoin, for example, anyone running the software on his or her computer also acts as the bank storing the exchange information. Ms. Athey said that while it was unclear if Bitcoin or a competing math-based currency — and hundreds of other virtual currencies are in the market now — would prevail, it was clear that there was a need for this type of tender online. “Something that has less frictions could enable certain types of commerce to occur that aren’t occurring today,” she said. And figuring out which digital currency will catch on could make you very rich. Mr. Hanyecz, for his part, has given up mining. With so many people trying to create Bitcoins, and the entire process becoming more difficult, the cost of running mining computers, in terms of the electricity bill alone, has soared. Any regrets about those pizzas? “No, not really,” Mr. Hanyecz said. He sold the rest of his Bitcoins as the price approached $1, netting him about $4,000. “That was enough to get a new computer and a couple of new video cards,” he told me, proudly. “So I’d say I ended up on top.” Email: bilton@nytimes.com",0.07506000000000002,0.061896782450353884
287,Into the Bitcoin Mines,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/into-the-bitcoin-mines/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-12-21T18:42:43+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"On the flat lava plain of Reykjanesbaer, Iceland, near the Arctic Circle, you can find the mines of Bitcoin. To get there, you pass through a fortified gate and enter a featureless yellow building. After checking in with a guard behind bulletproof glass, you face four more security checkpoints, including a so-called man trap that allows passage only after the door behind you has shut. This brings you to the center of the operation, a fluorescent-lit room with more than 100 whirring silver computers, each in a locked cabinet and each cooled by blasts of Arctic air shot up from vents in the floor. These computers are the laborers of the virtual mines where Bitcoins are unearthed. Instead of swinging pickaxes, these custom-built machines, which are running an open-source Bitcoin program, perform complex algorithms 24 hours a day. If they come up with the right answers before competitors around the world do, they win a block of 25 new Bitcoins from the virtual currency’s decentralized network. The network is programmed to release 21 million coins eventually. A little more than half are already out in the world, but because the system will release Bitcoins at a progressively slower rate, the work of mining could take more than 100 years. The scarcity — along with a speculative mania that has grown up around digital money — has made each new Bitcoin worth as much as $1,100 in recent weeks. Bitcoins are invisible money, backed by no government, useful only as a speculative investment or online currency, but creating them commands a surprisingly hefty real-world infrastructure. “What we have here are money-printing machines,” said Emmanuel Abiodun, 31, founder of the company that built the Iceland installation, shouting above the din of the computers. “We cannot risk that anyone will get to them.” Mr. Abiodun is one of a number of entrepreneurs who have rushed, gold-fever style, into large-scale Bitcoin mining operations in just the last few months. All of these people are making enormous bets that Bitcoin will not collapse, as it has threatened to do several times. Just last week, moves by Chinese authorities caused the price of a Bitcoin to drop briefly below $500. If the system did crash, the new computers would be essentially useless because they are custom-built for Bitcoin mining. Miners, though, are among the virtual-currency faithful, believing that Bitcoin will turn into a new, cheaper way of sending money around the world, leaving behind its current status as a largely speculative commodity. Most of the new operations popping up guard their secrecy closely, but Mr. Abiodun agreed to show his installation for the first time. An earnest young Briton, with the casual fashion taste of the tech cognoscenti, he was a computer programmer at HSBC in London when he decided to invest in specialized computers that would carry out constant Bitcoin mining. The computers that do the work eat up so much energy that electricity costs can be the deciding factor in profitability. There are Bitcoin mining installations in Hong Kong and Washington State, among other places, but Mr. Abiodun chose Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric energy are plentiful and cheap. And the arctic air is free and piped in to cool the machines, which often overheat when they are pushed to the outer limits of their computing capacity. The operation can baffle even those entrusted with its care. Helgi Helgason, a burly, bald Icelandic man who oversees the data center that houses the machines, said that when he first heard that a Bitcoin mining operation was moving in he expected something very different. “I thought we’d bring in machines and put bags behind them and the coins would fall into them,” said Mr. Helgason, with a laugh. Since then, the education he has received about Bitcoins has been enlightening, but only to a point. “It’s a strange business,” he said, “and I can’t say that I understand it.” Until just a few months ago, most Bitcoin mining was done on the home computers of digital-money fanatics. But as the value of a single Bitcoin skyrocketed over the last few months, the competition for new coins set off a race that quickly turned mining into an industrial enterprise. “Even if you had hardware earlier this year, that is becoming obsolete,” said Greg Schvey, a co-founder of Genesis Block, a virtual-currency research firm. “You are talking about order-of-magnitude jumps.” The work the computers do is akin to guessing at a lottery number. The faster the computers run, the better chance of guessing that right number and winning valuable coins. So mining entrepreneurs are buying chips and computers designed specifically — and only — for this work. The machines in Iceland are worth about $20,000 each on the open market. The energy required to run these computers is huge, and has led to criticism that Bitcoin mining is wasteful, not to mention socially useless. But Mr. Abiodun prides himself on using renewable power, at least in Iceland. When Mr. Abiodun first heard about Bitcoin mining in 2010, he thought it was a scam. Begun in 2009 as the imaginative creation of an anonymous programmer (or group of programmers) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it was initially little more than a tech world curiosity. As early users connected their computers into the network, they became a part of the decentralized infrastructure that hosts Bitcoin’s open-source program. The computers joining the network immediately began capturing virtual coins. The network’s protocol was designed to release a new block of Bitcoins every 10 minutes until all 21 million were released, with the blocks getting smaller as time goes on. If the miners in the network take more than 10 minutes to guess the correct code, the Bitcoin program adapts to make the puzzle easier. If they solve the problems in less than 10 minutes, the code becomes harder. Mr. Abiodun’s opinion of Bitcoin changed in January, when he saw the price rising. He installed a free application on his home computer that linked him into the Bitcoin network and set it to mining, harnessing the power of his graphics card, which is the part of a normal computer best suited to doing the code work. Mr. Abiodun’s computer was in the guest room of his house in southeast London. Working at HSBC during the day and tinkering with his Bitcoin system at night, he realized if he wanted to make any money, his computer would have to run around the clock. The constant computing, however, overheated the graphics card and pushed the computer’s exhaust fans into overdrive. When he added another graphics card, then a new computer, the room became too noisy for guests to sleep, and the windows had to be kept open to release the heat. That did not make his wife, Gloria, who was pregnant at the time, very happy. “It just created a scenario where there was no way our parents would come over to stay,” he said. “I did offer to put her parents in a hotel, but that didn’t go down well.” Mr. Abiodun’s wife finally gave him an ultimatum — either the computers had to go, or he did. At the same time, he was making money, and friends were asking if they could invest in his mining operation. In February, Mr. Abiodun used the investors’ money to buy machines from a start-up dedicated solely to manufacturing specialized mining computers. The competition for those computers is so intense that he had to pay for them and wait for delivery. When the delays became lengthy, however, he went on eBay and paid $130,000 for two high-powered machines, which he set up in June in a data center in Kansas City, Kan. This was the beginning of Mr. Abiodun’s company, Cloud Hashing, which rents out computing power to people who want to mine without buying computers themselves. The term hashing refers to the repetitive code guessing that miners do. Today, all of the machines dedicated to mining Bitcoin have a computing power about 4,500 times the capacity of the United States government’s mightiest supercomputer, the IBM Sequoia, according to calculations done by Michael B. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. The computing capacity of the Bitcoin network has grown by around 30,000 percent since the beginning of the year. “This whole new kind of machine has come into existence in the last 12 months,” said Professor Taylor, who is studying mining hardware. In the chase for the lucky code that will unlock new Bitcoins, mining computers are also verifying and assigning unique identifying tags to each Bitcoin transaction, acting as accountants for the virtual currency world. “The network is providing the infrastructure for making sure the currency is being transferred between people according to the rules,” Professor Taylor said, “and making sure people aren’t creating currency illegally.” Even before Mr. Abiodun’s machines in Kansas City were up and running, it was clear that they wouldn’t be enough. So he ordered about 100 machines from a start-up in Sweden and, in October, had them moved to the facility in Iceland. In just a few months, that installation has generated more than $4 million worth of Bitcoins, at the current value, according to the company’s account on the public Bitcoin network. At the end of each day, the spoils are divided up and sent to Cloud Hashing’s customers. Last Wednesday, for example, the entire operation unlocked 225 Bitcoins, valued at around $160,000 at recent prices. Cloud Hashing keeps about 20 percent of the capacity for its own mining. The unregulated Bitcoin-mining industry is ripe for abuse, and ventures that sound similar to Cloud Hashing have turned out to be scams. Mr. Abiodun’s company has proved itself real, but it is still unclear if it is a good deal for customers. Cloud Hashing charges $999 to rent a tiny portion of the company’s computing power for one year. That’s an expensive price for the computing capacity they are getting, but Mr. Abiodun argues that it’s a good value because individual miners would not be able to buy his modern machines outright. It’s a little like buying a fractional ownership in a private jet; you might not want responsibility for the jet itself, and it’s out of your price range anyway. He also says he provides the maintenance and keeps away thieves and hackers. Some Cloud Hashing customers have also complained on Internet forums that it can be hard to get a response from the company when something goes wrong. But this has not stopped new contracts from pouring in. Cloud Hashing now has 4,500 customers, up from 1,000 in September. Mr. Abiodun acknowledges that the company has not been prepared to deal with its rapid growth. He said he had used $4 million raised from two angel investors to add customer service representatives to offices in Austin, Tex., and London. Cloud Hashing is now preparing to open a mining facility in a data center near Dallas, which will hold more than $3 million worth of new machines being produced by CoinTerra, a Texas start-up run by a former Samsung chip designer. The higher energy costs — and required air-conditioning — in Texas are worth it for Mr. Abiodun. He wants his operation to be widely distributed in case of power shortages or regulatory issues in one location. But he is also expanding his Icelandic operation, shipping in about 66 machines that have been running for the last few months near their manufacturer in Ukraine. Mr. Abiodun said that by February, he hopes to have about 15 percent of the entire computing power of the Bitcoin network, significantly more than any other operation. Inside the Iceland data center, which also hosts servers for large companies like BMW and is guarded and maintained by a company called Verne Global, strapping Icelandic men in black outfits were at work recently setting up the racks for the machines coming from Ukraine. Gazing over his creation, Mr. Abiodun had a look that was somewhere between pride and anxiety, and spoke about the virtues of this Icelandic facility where the power has not gone down once. “We don’t want downtime — ever, never,” he said. “Not with what we paid. Not with Bitcoin.”",0.10240373831775701,0.05929462347102534

But you’d be wrong. That description is as outdated as a chintz sofa. The company, created almost 20 years ago, has been a pioneer in the mysterious world of cryptocurrency. It was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin and it’s trying very hard right now to make an even bigger bet by selling off its retail arm and concentrating on the blockchain technology that not only supports cryptocurrency but could revolutionize an array of business sectors. Its founder and chief executive, Patrick Byrne, thinks there’s a bigger future in using the blockchain for trading in capital markets, voting, protecting property rights and more. The plan is a bold one that is not without risks. The stock, which has risen steadily, dropped sharply earlier this year in the midst of overall uncertainty about the valuation of cryptocurrency. But it has stabilized and is now trading at nearly double its price last June. Mr. Byrne seems undaunted despite the gyrations. “When we started off we were proud of saying we’re not a tech company, we’re a lemonade stand with a computer in it,” he said. [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here’s what you need to know.] But now, “it’s a logical time to sell our e-commerce business — to cash in my chips and do this crypto stuff on my own. I want to share the upside with my shareholders.” Mr. Byrne, along with his extended family, owns roughly 30 percent of Overstock. The evolution of Overstock has been both deliberate and serendipitous. The company initially relied on third-party technology for its sales, but more than 10 years ago it began building its own. A turning point came in late 2013 when Mr. Byrne gathered together a group of Overstock programmers to figure out how to accept Bitcoin for purchases. They moved quickly; within a month, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was never the end goal, he said; instead, it was only the first step in seeing what was possible with the nascent blockchain technology. Nearly five years later, the company generates from $68,000 to $120,000 in cryptocurrency revenues weekly. That translates to roughly “0.2 percent of our revenue,” Mr. Byrne said, adding that Overstock “converts a lot of that into dollars.” The handful of programmers and developers who came up with the initial Bitcoin capability has grown into a corps of about 65, based at the company’s new headquarters, which was built on a former Superfund site about 12 miles from Salt Lake City. In 2014, the company created a subsidiary, Medici Ventures, to manage and oversee its investments in blockchain-related firms. It was named for the Medici Bank of Florence — a pioneer of the double entry bookkeeping that revolutionized money and banking in the Renaissance. One of the investment results was tZero, described in the company’s most recent quarterly report, as comprising a “financial technology company, two related registered broker dealers, a registered investment adviser and an accredited investor verification company.” More colloquially, Mr. Byrne describes tZero as the place where “blockchain meets capital markets.” The name tZero stems from the initial goal — to trade securities that settle immediately, rather than after the three-day waiting period that existed under federal securities rules. (That time period was shortened to two days last September.) After several years of working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create the system, tZero got the regulatory go-ahead in December 2016, and a small class of Overstock equity is trading via that technology. But that platform was itself upended by last year’s proliferation of initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, which have created an alternative way to raise capital. Responding to the turnabout, tZero began focusing on the technology needed to develop a platform to trade the so-called coins or tokens created in offerings. And to raise capital, tZero itself designed what Mr. Byrne calls a security token offering — as opposed to an I.C.O. — saying that it complies with federal securities law. Whether the S.E.C. agrees with that characterization is an open question. Earlier this year, the commission escalated its oversight of I.C.O.s, asserting that many were really equity offerings in disguise. TZero is among those under investigation, Mr. Byrne acknowledged. But he called the heightened S.E.C. oversight “long overdue” for a market he viewed as rife with fraud and he expressed confidence that tZero’s offering was properly done. He said he was looking forward to meeting with the S.E.C. again — a not-so-veiled reference to the agency’s investigations into Overstock following several earnings restatements roughly a decade ago. No action has been taken against Overstock in the past. The S.E.C.’s current investigation, on which the agency has declined to comment, hasn’t slowed tZero’s expansion efforts. Mr. Byrne recently met with potential investors overseas but hasn’t yet disclosed how much money has been raised. In addition to technology under development, in May, tZero and Box Digital Markets announced a joint venture to create what they say is the “industry’s first regulated security token exchange.” Medici Ventures has backed other companies as well. With its president, Jonathan Johnson, a former Overstock board chairman from 2014 to 2017, Medici has so far invested an undisclosed amount in 13 blockchain companies. Among those is Bitt, a Barbados-based start-up that aims to serve people without bank accounts by creating digital wallets that would circumvent the need for the accounts or for credit cards. The market could be a large one. The World Bank recently found that 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts, although two-thirds of those own mobile phones. The company recently invested in Finclusive, which seeks to serve the estimated 7 percent of households in the United States without banking accounts as well as the approximately 20 percent of households that have a checking or savings account, but no other financial products through the banking system. The company, according to its website, connects financial service professionals with those currently underserved by the finance industry. Medici’s portfolio extends beyond the financial technology sector, including start-ups such as Voatz, a Boston-based company that seeks to secure voting via smartphones and blockchain. According to Mr. Johnson, colleges, unions and some municipalities, have tested the technology, which, he said, provided privacy and security through the use of biometrics and an ability to confirm that one’s vote had been counted. Most recently, West Virginia became the first state to test the technology in its recent primary election, allowing overseas members of the military to cast their votes. Michael Queen, a spokesman for the West Virginia secretary of state, said in an email that “a comprehensive audit is being conducted to evaluate the security of the blockchain used for the mobile application.” Six ago, Mr. Byrne and Medici formed a joint venture with the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar, a longtime proponent of protecting property rights — especially for people in developing nations, where the rights are often exploited. Mr. Byrne said he sought out Mr. De Soto, cultivating a friendship that resulted in De Soto Inc., a so-called social benefit company that would use blockchain to record property ownership. Even with the prospect of selling its retail arm, Overstock continues to invest in its e-commerce efforts, including working on efficiency in its supply chain and adding a new distribution center to improve its two-day shipping. Although it’s clear from interviews and earnings calls that Mr. Byrne’s sights are set on cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology, he cautions this is not an asset class for the general public. “While I wax enthusiastic, and while there’s a pony in there somewhere, the public should stay away from cryptocurrency. At least until the S.E.C. gets its arms around it,” he said.",0.10392608695652175,0.03135345431541083

That has created no small amount of grumbling among Chinese Bitcoin buyers, who have been some of the most enthusiastic investors in the digital money. “The drop in Bitcoin’s value in the last few days has been terrible, I’ve felt really uncertain,” an investor surnamed Chen told The Securities Times, a Chinese financial newspaper. Mr. Chen said he had bought five coins recently at a price of 3,100 renminbi, or about $510, apiece. On Wednesday the value dropped to three-quarters of that. “I thought I’d make a little short-term investment,” he said. “I didn’t think I’d lose money.” On Wednesday, BTC China, the country’s largest Bitcoin exchange, said it had been told to stop accepting deposits in Chinese currency. The announcement was the latest in a series of steps that have restricted the ability to buy and use Bitcoins in China. The country’s leading third-party payment processors were told on Monday by the central bank to stop accepting the currency, according to Chinese news reports. And on Dec. 5, the People’s Bank of China and other regulators ordered traditional financial institutions in China to stop Bitcoin transactions.  Those moves have raised widespread doubts in China over the virtual currency, which saw values climb to 7,395 renminbi, or $1,218, on Dec. 1. After dropping to 2,300 renminbi late Wednesday, the price for a Bitcoin quoted by BTC China recovered slightly to around 3,000 renminbi by Thursday afternoon. Chinese economists had warned investors about the risks inherent in the virtual money. “When it comes to Bitcoin, early on I said that ordinary people should stay far away from it,” Yi Xianrong, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote on his Tencent Weibo microblog after the central bank began making moves to restrict Bitcoin in early December. “It’s not a real currency — it doesn’t have a guarantee of creditworthiness. The risks are very high, and if ordinary people play the market they’re on their own. The central bank announcement told us what would happen with people who thought they were going to get rich quick and just got burned.” One Chinese Bitcoin investor bought 10 Bitcoins when the price was at 2,000 renminbi each after seeing friends earn good returns, The Economic Daily News reported. “After half a month or so the price climbed to 7,000. It was unexpected and I was so happy. But I didn’t sell them. I thought, even if it dropped a little, I would still be ahead,” the investor, who was identified only by the surname Xu, told the paper. Some Chinese media outlets said the website of the People’s Bank of China was inaccessible for a short period on Wednesday afternoon, and said it might have been the target of a hacking attempt launched in retaliation over the moves to restrict Bitcoin use. The Beijing Times newspaper quoted a bank representative who confirmed that the website had been down but was operating normally by 6 p.m. The bank representative offered no explanation as to the cause of the temporary problem.",0.0248037037037037,0.026002400548696843

The price volatility is underscoring Bitcoin’s sensitivity to decisions by government officials despite its promised status as the first global currency free of government intervention and oversight. Money, it turns out, is still a government prerogative. “This tight regulation is really counter to what a lot of folks thought was going to happen,” said Mark T. Williams, a finance professor at Boston University who has been tracking Bitcoin. “Regulation is the future of e-currency, not decentralization as many had hoped.” The most damaging news for the digital currency has come out of China, where the largest Bitcoin exchange, BTC China, said on Wednesday that it would no longer accept deposits in renminbi, the Chinese currency. “For reasons we all know, BTC China has had to cease renminbi-account charging functions,” the exchange said in a message on its verified account on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like messaging service. It said that it would continue operating and that existing deposits and renminbi withdrawals would not be affected. By Wednesday evening, the Shanghai-based BTC was quoting Bitcoins at about 3,200 renminbi, or $530, each. That was a drop of nearly 40 percent from the price on Tuesday and less than half of the peak price of 7,395 renminbi on Dec. 1. The development comes less than two weeks after the Chinese authorities barred mainstream financial institutions from dealing in the virtual currency and a series of moves that followed elsewhere. China had been the fastest-growing part of the Bitcoin world, but it is not the only place where government officials have started to address virtual currency. Over the last week, the European Banking Authority and the authorities in Denmark, Norway, Australia and New Zealand have all raised an alarm about the speculative nature of the new online currencies. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority issued a warning on Tuesday that gave a long list of dangers, including that the “value of your virtual currencies can change very quickly and can in principle fall to zero.” The warnings have led to a sharp reversal for Bitcoin after the price of a single coin rose nearly 500 percent in November, fueled by hopes that the currency could serve as a cheaper global payment system. Bitcoins are created and traded according to an open-source program released in 2009. The decentralized network of computers that runs the system is set to release only 21 million Bitcoins, but they are worth only what someone will pay for them. The volatility provides some vindication for critics who have recently been calling Bitcoin a bubble that was sure to pop. Earlier this month, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said on Bloomberg Television that it had no “intrinsic value.” Professor Williams of Boston University said that Bitcoin had followed the trademark patterns of past asset bubbles, and he predicted that the value would fall to as low as $10 next year. But Bitcoin aficionados are far from accepting that the recent declines spell any sort of long-term trouble for the movement. Users took to Twitter to mount a defense. And the currency has survived swings in value in the past. In April, the value fell 70 percent in a matter of days but eventually recovered fully. Even after the recent declines, the price of Bitcoin is still up 180 percent from where it was in early November. During the day on Wednesday, the price had risen more than 40 percent from its morning low. “If you look at charts going back for the last few years, this happens all the time,” said Greg Schvey, the founder of the Genesis Block, a research firm that follows digital money. “The price is going to fluctuate, but more people know about it, more companies use it and more investment is going into Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is stronger than it’s ever been.” Some Bitcoin advocates have actually been unhappy with the recent run-up in the price, which has caused many users to hoard their coins rather than spend them. This has led many people to say that Bitcoin cannot rightfully be called a currency. Many of the recent announcements from the European authorities have questioned whether virtual currencies live up to their name. A Norwegian official told Bloomberg News last week that Bitcoin could not be called money and would be treated as an investment asset. But the news out of Europe has not been all negative for the future of digital money. The warning from Denmark this week suggested that consumers would be free to use Bitcoins despite the risks. The United States has taken a similarly cautious but accepting attitude toward virtual currencies. Officials with the Treasury Department have indicated that virtual currency exchanges will be allowed to operate as long as they register as money-transmitting operations. But there are questions about how successful a global decentralized currency can be if people in China, the world’s second-largest economy, are shut out. According to Chinese news reports, the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, met on Monday with more than 10 of the country’s biggest third-party payment processing companies, ordering them to stop all transactions involving digital currencies. Alibaba’s Alipay service, the country’s biggest processor of online transactions, was among the companies represented at the meeting, according to the reports. On Dec. 5, the central bank and the four agencies jointly banned dealing in Bitcoin, saying the government was acting to “safeguard the interests and property rights of the public, protect the legal standing of the renminbi, take precautions against the risk of money laundering and maintain financial stability.” “Within that region, it’s hit a bit of a hurdle that will have to sort itself out,” Mr. Schvey said.",0.03580697674418604,0.06311279321453739

In the process, it is bringing its backers financial losses and intellectual embarrassment. As far as price is concerned, Bitcoin is behaving as it has for the last two years: with intense volatility. The dollar price of a Bitcoin rose from $5 at the beginning of 2012 to $1,200 in early December. As of Wednesday afternoon Beijing time, it was trading just above $500, having fallen by about a quarter during the day. The catalyst for the latest collapse was news from a leading Chinese Bitcoin exchange that the government in Beijing had banned new purchases with renminbi. Bitcoin enthusiasts may say the authorities are acting because they feared the growth of a currency free of the power of an oppressive state. Hardly. They saw a smuggler’s paradise – a means of exchange for illegal deals and a tool for dodging capital controls. Lurking behind the recent falls are fundamental intellectual flaws. Bitcoin’s technological wizardry promises scarcity, which is a prerequisite for the existence of value. But demand is also important.  There are similarities between Bitcoiners and gold bugs: distrust of government being one. Unlike bullion, however, the community-run computer program is neither beautiful nor truly useful. The startling price volatility, meanwhile, undermines the belief that Bitcoin can serve as a medium of exchange. Users normally need assurance that currencies will hold their value – over short periods at least. Speculation, not fundamental value, explains why Bitcoin nearly quadrupled in value in November. Buyers simply wanted to get in while the going was good. Now the Bitcoin story is turning sour, owners are trying to capture some of their gains, or cut their losses. Compared with the peak, Bitcoin’s price is down more than 50 percent. The fall reinforces the message from Beijing: There is no good reason to own Bitcoins. The electronic pseudocurrency has had a good run. Ideologues, speculators and scammers enjoyed the fun while it lasted. But now that the authorities are taking notice, the price has much further to fall.

When there is a bubble with gold or with the real estate market, no one questions the raison d’être of these two entities. Just like gold, bitcoin can act as a safe haven in times of crisis. The defining characteristic is that bitcoin and other digital currencies offer the possibility of a quick, international means of payment with very low transaction fees. In addition, bitcoin as a currency is not dependent on governments. Mr. Sorkin seems to be skeptical about the “mining” process whereby individuals make bitcoins on a network. Yet the security of the system is not in doubt. When something revolutionary appears, conservative minds shun the idea. I recall “experts” back in the 1990s saying that the Internet would not last. Undoubtedly bitcoin will suffer from speculation, but its underlying principle — an open-source, decentralized method of payment — will last. In time we will see how deeply the roots of digital currencies will run in our societies. David Boveington-Fauran Kraainem, Belgium Regarding “Sustaining at sea” (Editorial, Dec. 5): Protecting ocean ecosystems is indeed crucial; new findings illustrate that resilience in dealing with climate change improves when fishing is reduced. That insight came from long-term data on biodiversity, which, as the Tasmanian study mentioned, are scarce in rapidly warming regions. In fact, detailed biodiversity data about most marine ecosystems are scarce, yet they are fundamental to understanding how these complex ecosystems respond to global change. Ocean-observing systems are now extensive and sophisticated but focus largely on physical data like temperature, currents and acidity, the first links in a long chain of interactions that produce healthy fisheries and resilient coastlines. The identity and abundance of the living, interacting organisms that constitute the rest of the chain need to be assiduously studied to diagnose problems early and maintain healthy ecosystems. These critical environmental issues are why the Smithsonian Institution is building the first global, long-term network to study marine biodiversity — the Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network. J.

After all, so many headlines in the last few weeks have focused on its market price and the cool stuff you can get with it: Bitcoin breaks $1,000! Bitcoin plunges by a half! Bitcoin has a banner Black Friday! Use bitcoin to buy a ride on Richard Branson’s starship! But all the talk about bitcoin’s value (or lack thereof) obscures the fact that it was never really meant as an investment nor primarily as a way to purchase sex toys or alpaca socks — let alone a brand-new Lamborghini. One could argue that bitcoin isn’t chiefly a commercial venture at all, a funny thing to say about a kind of online cash. To its creators and numerous disciples, bitcoin is — and always has been — a mostly ideological undertaking, more philosophy than finance. “The ideas behind it — that’s what attracted me,” said Elizabeth Ploshay, a regular writer for Bitcoin magazine, which describes its mission as being “the most accurate and up-to-date source of information, news and commentary about bitcoin.” And if the magazine has a mission, so, too, does the subject that it covers. As Ms. Ploshay explained it, bitcoin isn’t merely money; it’s “a movement” — a crusade in the costume of a currency. Depending on whom you talk to, the goal is to unleash repressed economies, to take down global banking or to wage a war against the Federal Reserve. For those with an uncertain understanding of its history, bitcoin entered the world on Jan. 3, 2009, when a shadowy hacker — or team of hackers — working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto released an ingenious string of computer code that established a system permitting people to transfer money to one another online, directly, anonymously and outside government control, in much the way that Napster once allowed the unrestrained transfer of music files. In a 500-word essay that accompanied the code, Nakamoto suggested that the motive for creating bitcoin was anger at the financial crisis: “The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” It was fundamentally a political document and, as such, it attracted followers among libertarian and anarchist groups who saw in bitcoin a means of removing the money supply from the grasping hands of government. In blog posts and at bitcoin conferences around the globe, these evangelists began to spread its gospel. It is only in the last few months, as bitcoin has attracted the attention of political parties, regulators and speculative investors that the narrative of bitcoin as a tool for change has been drowned out by a simpler story line: that of bitcoin as a kind of crypto-credit card — or, even more, as a digitized casino game. “Price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin,” said Roger Ver, an early investor who is often called, in a typical movement phrase, the Bitcoin Jesus. “At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.” While the bitcoin hype has inspired Ron Paulian dreams of evading inflation and undermining the Federal Reserve, the currency has also gained cachet among less conspicuously conservative adherents, like the founders of BitPesa, a start-up firm in Nairobi, Kenya, that plans to help Africans abroad send money to their families at home. According to the World Bank, $1.3 billion in remittances is sent each year to Kenya, a process that costs about $110 million in fees. By using bitcoin’s peer-to-peer technology to avoid banks and wire-transfer companies like Western Union, BitPesa hopes to reduce these fees by two-thirds, saving ordinary Africans $74 million annually. You know you’re talking to a true bitcoin believer if you hear the word “disruption.” But that’s how bitcoin is seen within the broader movement: as an unruly tool with potentially transformative effects on entrenched businesses like retail payment and asset management. “Right now in the United States, bitcoin is mainly considered a get-rich-quick scheme with a little financial privacy thrown in,” said Jon Matonis, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the self-proclaimed center of the decentralized crusade. “But its larger implications down the road are major disruptions to certain legacy industries.” Mr. Matonis added that the ideology of bitcoin was wide enough to accommodate people on all points on the spectrum — “from libertarian capitalists to socialists.” It not only has a following among the anti-central bank crowd, he said; it has also proved attractive to communitarians like the residents of the Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, which now boasts the highest density of businesses accepting bitcoin in the world. There are even those who see bitcoin as the ultimate alternative to the global banking system. Ryan Singer, a co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Tradehill, based in San Francisco, compared the currency to email, conjecturing that it would gradually supplant traditional banking, just as digital messaging displaced handwritten letters. “When kids wake up to the fact that they don’t need their parents’ help to create a bitcoin wallet,” Mr. Singer said, “when they can use bitcoins for free international transactions, at any hour, in every major city on the planet, then you’ll know that something has changed.” Perhaps the best proof of bitcoin’s ideological underpinnings is that a schism has emerged in recent weeks between moderate elements in the movement who sense the necessity of cooperating with officialdom, and a more uncompromising faction that wants to keep bitcoin free from any government regulation. The hard-line bloc is exemplified by the crypto-anarchist developers of a bitcoin product called Dark Wallet, which is scheduled to be introduced next year and will include extra protections to ensure that bitcoin transactions remain secure, anonymous and difficult to trace. “We see this as part of the total sublation of the state,” said Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet’s director, who gained fame earlier this year when he published online the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3-D printer. “I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah’s Witness, but we’ve only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues.”",0.21627741935483868,0.0386191916282642

The union’s banking authority said consumers needed to be aware that they were not protected through regulation when paying with Bitcoins. The digital currency is vulnerable to hackers, might lose its value and any misuse could prompt law enforcement agencies to close Bitcoin exchange platforms and keep consumers from accessing their investment, the European regulator said. “Currently, no specific protection exists in the E.U. that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,” the European Banking Authority said, adding that it was looking into whether such currencies could and should be regulated. The warning comes after China last week restricted its banks from using Bitcoin as currency because of concerns about money laundering and a threat to financial stability. Germany said earlier this year that it would not recognize Bitcoin as a foreign currency and that gains from buying and selling Bitcoins would be taxable. Norway has been considering a similar stance. Since its creation in 2009 by anonymous programmers, Bitcoin has surged in popularity and consumers have been using the virtual currency to pay for goods and services. But some authorities and regulators decided only recently to treat the currency as something more serious than a temporary mania. New York state’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, said in November that he would consider issuing a so-called BitLicense for businesses that conduct transactions in virtual currencies like Bitcoin. At a Senate hearing last month, regulatory officials said virtual currencies could benefit the financial system but could also be abused for criminal activity. Britain’s financial regulator has said it does not consider Bitcoin to be within its area of responsibility because the currency was not used widely enough to be considered money. The European Banking Authority said “cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency with little prospect of having it returned.”  “While virtual currencies continue to hit the headlines and are enjoying increasing popularity, consumers need to remain aware of the risks associated with them,” the European authority said. Germany and China this month detained a group of people on suspicion of fraud linked to the virtual currency. The authority also warned that consumers should “remain mindful that holding virtual currencies may have tax implications.” The value of Bitcoin rose beyond $1,100 in November, leaving its total worldwide value at more than $11 billion, but it has dropped below $1,000 since then.  ",-0.047366666666666654,0.029955808080808086

While Bitcoin has many naysayers who have called it a speculative bubble and a playing field for frauds, a growing number of mainstream players say it has the potential to be a sort of Internet for money, smoothing the electronic movement of cash. Last week, Bank of America released the first significant research note on digital money, laying out its potential. But the biggest excitement has been among technology insiders like Mr. Dixon. “We aren’t thinking that Amazon is going to be using Bitcoin tomorrow, but I think they will be in five years,” Mr. Dixon said. “It’s one of the five best computer science ideas of the last 40 years.” A steady stream of Silicon Valley investors has been building stakes in virtual currency start-ups. Last month, a Chinese Bitcoin exchange raised $5 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners. Google’s venture capital arm has put money into a couple of companies in the space, Buttercoin and Ripple Labs. Coinbase has also attracted money from Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. Bitcoin, created by anonymous programmers in 2009, is a digital currency produced by a network of users competing against one another to solve computer problems, a method known as “mining.” The open-source program that created it determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created, leading to a speculative boom that pushed the price of one Bitcoin to more than $1,000 recently from around $200 at the start of November. The growth has led to uncertainty about how regulators will deal with digital money. Chinese authorities last week barred financial institutions in the country from participating in virtual currency transactions. American regulators, on the other hand, have made cautiously supportive statements about the trend. Silicon Valley investors generally hope that Bitcoin will move past the current stage and settle into a more stable period that will allow it to be used as a system for making payments and sending money around the world. Since its founding a little more than a year ago, Coinbase has developed a reputation as one of the most reliable players in the often chaotic world of virtual currencies. The company enables merchants to accept digital money for ordinary purchases and allows customers to trade Bitcoins and hold them in online wallets. Coinbase says it is adding 10,000 online wallets daily and now hosts 600,000 wallets, up from 200,000 just a few months ago. Coinbase said it planned to use the new money to expand its staff and “promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.” The company added that the world was “nearing a tipping point for broad adoption of Bitcoin — what we at Coinbase believe to be one of the most important shifts in the global economy in our lifetime.” Virtual currencies are accepted at a growing number of merchants. The company Bitpay said this week that it had processed more than $100 million in transactions this year. But this is tiny compared with the number of transactions made by speculators and people buying illicit goods. Mr. Dixon said that Bitcoin had been too complicated for most people who are not technology specialists. But he said that services like Coinbase made it easier to access, opening it to broader use. Some merchants hope that virtual currencies will let them avoid the 2 to 3 percent that they pay on every credit card transaction. In another step in Bitcoin’s expansion, the leading nonprofit advocacy group for digital money, the Bitcoin Foundation, said on Thursday that it was opening a London office and creating a program for international affiliates that will include the Bitcoin Association of Australia and the Bitcoin Foundation Canada. The Bitcoin Foundation’s primary operations are based in Washington.",0.23110882352941178,0.05939194996180291

For Bitcoin fanatics, the original blockchain was a way to create a currency that could circumvent and eventually supersede central banks. For central banks, the blockchain has become a promising way to record their own currencies in an effort to retain their dominant place in society. For some cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Zcash, the blockchain is a way to ensure total privacy and anonymity. For others it is a way to make anonymity a thing of the past in financial transactions. Beneath all these conflicting goals, the blockchain is just a new way to record data, generally in a communal fashion, with a bunch of people keeping the records, rather than just one central institution like a bank or government. This basic idea, though, can be configured in countless different ways. And companies, start-ups and governments around the world have been engaged in what sometimes looks like a race to try out as many applications as possible, with billions of dollars chasing the promise. What has not become clear, so far, is whether the blockchain design will really be able to accomplish any of the big promises that have been made for it. Essentially every big category of project in the blockchain realm has run up against obstacles that have so far barred the way to real breakout success. That has led to a big decline in the price of many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies over the last six months — the price of Bitcoin is down nearly two-thirds from the peak in December. But while we don’t yet know if blockchains will really work in the long run, we are starting to understand the problems they will have to overcome if they want to have a chance at working. The blockchain we know the most about is the original one, linked to Bitcoin. In a simple sense, this blockchain has been a resounding success. Since it began recording every Bitcoin transaction in 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has more or less seamlessly kept the records of a currency that is now worth over $100 billion — and with no institution or person in charge. But Bitcoin has so far failed at its goal of becoming a new kind of digital cash, which was the ambition described in the original documentation. So far, almost the only thing Bitcoin has been used for is a speculative commodity, like a digital gold, with lots of trading on the price. (The one place where Bitcoin has been used for regular real transactions is in the black markets.) There are many reasons Bitcoin has not been more useful so far. The monetary policy and economics of Bitcoin — with only 21 million of the coins ever created — are a particularly fascinating question mark hanging over the project. As are the security issues that arise when every holder is responsible for keeping their own password, or private key. But no problem has been more immediately stubborn than the limits on how many transactions the Bitcoin blockchain can handle. It turns out that when a whole bunch of people are keeping the records for something — as the blockchain design requires — there are limits on how many transactions all those computers can share and store in a set amount of time. This issue — the so-called scaling problem — is now something that confronts essentially every major cryptocurrency out there. While Bitcoin can handle only around seven or so transactions each second, the second most valuable network, Ethereum, can do only double that, and none of them are getting close to the 50,000 a second that Visa manages. Developers working on Bitcoin and Ethereum have been building several different solutions that might address this. Most of them involve adding new databases, with more capacity, on top of the ground level blockchain ledgers. So far, though, it’s not clear if these can work without introducing new problems or sacrificing the qualities that attracted followers to these projects in the first place. Ethereum, and a bunch of other valuable cryptocurrencies that have been inspired by it, have a separate set of problems that they will have to figure out. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, wanted to build a system that would house a virtual currency like Bitcoin, but with the added ability to create programs, directly on the blockchain, that could make some of the currency’s movements automatic. In the simplest type of transaction, the Ethereum blockchain will record money moving between wallets (which are like individual accounts) only in response to a particular event. In one simple type of transaction, for example, money would move between wallets only if a specific team won the World Series. These so-called smart contracts inside Ethereum are now being copied by many other projects. Ethereum, though, has been dogged by new complexities that smart contracts have introduced into an already fiendishly complicated system. Ethereum smart contracts have been hacked and rigged in unexpected ways that have allowed for multiple thefts of tens of millions of dollars. That is a small minority of all the transactions, but it makes many people worry about whether blockchain smart contracts have, in the language of hackers, created too great a surface area for attack. Some worry that these sorts of smart contracts are just not the sort of thing that a shared database is equipped to handle. Many of the problems facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum arise from the fact that these systems are open to anyone with internet access. Anyone can go online and create a wallet and begin helping to keep all the records for these systems that run on so-called public blockchains. That creates a security headache that cryptocurrencies were designed to deal with, but that never goes away. What do you do when North Korea, or some other actor under sanctions, starts moving money on the system? That kind of question has led most newcomers to the blockchain world — many of them from the corporate and government worlds — to take an interest in newer kinds of blockchain databases that aren’t as open. The world of private or permissioned blockchains has taken off over the last two years, with projects like Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance getting a lot of attention (the latter is working on private versions of the Ethereum software). These systems have fewer people keeping track of any given blockchain. That makes it easier to scale up these systems to handle lots of transactions, because there are fewer computers that have to communicate. It also can make it easier to bar bad actors from getting access to the system because only people with permission have access to it. Companies like IBM and Walmart have said that blockchains, even when they are open only to a select number of people, still can produce more reliable records of information — that everyone can access at any time — than the old systems that relied on a central bookkeeper. But fans of Bitcoin and other so-called public blockchain systems have mocked these projects. The often-heard criticism is that a blockchain that is being maintained by only a few institutions is less at risk of an attack from the outside but much more at risk if one of the institutions on the inside is compromised, allowing one of the participants to fudge the old records. These private blockchains can lose the resilience to attack that is part of what made blockchains so attractive in the first place. For now, private blockchains are too new to have gone through the security gantlet that Bitcoin has already passed through. Many private blockchain projects have been tested in pilots — but almost none have entered into real commercial production. As private blockchains begin to be used daily to track supply chains or copyrights, the other big question is whether they will be economically attractive enough to persuade companies to replace their old database systems — with one person in charge — with the inefficiencies that come with multiple people keeping records. But the Bitcoin blockchain faced much more significant questions when it began — like why would any serious person pay attention to some digital tokens that are worth nothing more than the ledger they are written on. Now there are lots of serious people paying attention to Bitcoin and everything that has spun out from it — the latest blockchain research center is about to be opened by professors at Stanford University. All those serious people make solving problems a lot easier.",0.20791296296296297,0.10716926206509542

The development of Bitcoin, the virtual currency that is not issued by any government, presents challenges for the authorities to use laws that were not designed for the digital world to combat illegal conduct. DealBook reported on “fraud, hacking and outright theft that have become an increasingly regular part of the virtual currency world.” Bitcoin itself is neither good nor bad, just a new means to conduct business, but virtual currency operates in ways that make it harder to prosecute violations. The value of the Bitcoins available now is quite small, totaling approximately $12 billion. Yet the perception that growing acceptance of virtual currencies will change the way business operates means governments will have to figure out how to deal with new forms of crime. There is a Wild West quality to Bitcoin, created out of a libertarian bent that connotes a world beyond government regulation. Like any currency, it carries with it a degree of anonymity, much as the phrase “cash is an orphan” signals that money can be largely untraceable once put into circulation. More than ordinary cash, though, Bitcoin operates largely outside the current banking system, making it even more difficult to trace transactions. Reports of Bitcoins being stolen from the “wallets” of users look much like those concerning any other type of theft. Under the traditional common law of larceny, however, stealing virtual currency would not be the subject of a prosecution because the law applies only to the removal of physical items. Modern theft statutes allow for prosecution for the taking of intangible property, so the greater challenge is pursuing thefts that occur in cyberspace. State authorities often do not have the resources to pursue crimes on the Internet nor the ability to coordinate investigations with foreign governments when the misconduct occurs outside the United States.   The Justice Department is often better equipped to pursue global crimes, but the statutes available to pursue the theft of Bitcoins are more limited. Unlike the states, there is no general federal theft statute, so prosecutors have to be more creative in pursing misconduct. There is a federal law used to prosecute the interstate transportation of stolen property, but it applies only to cases involving “goods, wares and merchandise.” In Dowling v. United States, the Supreme Court limited the reach of this law to the theft of physical items and not intangible property like virtual currency. The statute also covers transporting “money,” but that would not appear to cover a virtual currency sponsored by private issuers. Another law that could be used is a provision in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a crime to use a computer with the intent to defraud in obtaining anything of value from the victim. Whether stealing Bitcoins from an owner’s account would constitute fraud is unclear. If there is a scheme to mislead an owner of Bitcoins to part with them, then the broad federal wire fraud statute can be easier to use because it does not require proving misuse of a computer. And unlike the stolen property provision, this law covers both tangible and intangible property, so virtual currency would fit comfortably within it. A greater challenge to law enforcement is the lack of transparency in Bitcoin transactions, which can allow virtual currency to facilitate money laundering. Federal prosecutors convicted the administrator of the website Silk Road, which was used to distribute narcotics bought with virtual currency. The government seized nearly 175,000 Bitcoins, so clearly virtual currency can be used to buy drugs as if it were cash on a street corner. One potential challenge to pursuing money-laundering charges involving Bitcoin is the definition of the transactions subject to prosecution.   The statute applies to a “financial transaction” involving a “monetary instrument,” which includes “coin or currency of the United States or of any other country.” That definition would appear to exclude Bitcoin because it does not have any connection to a government.  Another provision applies to transactions in which a “financial institution” is involved, which includes banks and brokerage firms along with money services businesses that transmit money. Transactions in virtual currency take place largely outside typical financial firms, so trading may fall beyond the reach of the money-laundering laws unless providers qualify as a money services business. To extend the scope of the financial disclosure laws, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the Treasury Department, issued guidance in March requiring administrators and exchangers of virtual currencies to report transactions, including the identity of Bitcoin traders. That means those involved in “mining” Bitcoins for sale or operating a trading venue are considered a money transmitter, which could qualify them as a financial institution for purposes of the money-laundering laws. Currency, even the virtual type, is usually not understood to be a security or a commodity subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  But when packaged for investors, Bitcoins could fall under the jurisdiction of those agencies. Whenever something rises substantially in value, like Bitcoin’s increase of nearly 1,000 percent over the last month, investment offers will crop up to tap into the potential riches. The S.E.C. filed a lawsuit in July accusing a Texas man of engaging in a Ponzi scheme by offering Bitcoin-denominated investments. The definition of a security includes an “investment contract,” which can be almost anything as long as it involves a commitment of money to others to generate profits from their efforts. The Supreme Court has found that investments in orange groves and pay telephones can qualify as securities subject to the S.E.C.’s jurisdiction, so investments in virtual currency could fall under the agency’s purview. Packaging Bitcoins together for future delivery could also qualify as a commodity subject to regulation by the C.F.T.C. As The New York Times reported, the People’s Bank of China and four other Chinese agencies issued a notice that Bitcoin is a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency.” As Bitcoin gains wider acceptance, the tax collector will most likely seek the government’s cut of transactions. For those paid in virtual currency, the federal tax law provides that “gross income means all income from whatever source derived,” about as broad a definition as possible.  For those who mine Bitcoins, they can be considered a capital asset generating capital gains when sold that must be reported. Any failure to pay taxes can bring about both civil and criminal penalties, which are not yet payable in Bitcoin. The rise of virtual currencies may have started out as an effort to avoid government scrutiny. But with greater acceptance comes increased regulation, including the application of criminal laws to this new medium for conducting business.",0.026056818181818184,0.03443198215925489

While such bid ’em up, sell ’em off scams are shut down in the financial markets all the time, this one and other frauds involving digital money have gone unchecked. The reason, in no small part: Government authorities do not agree on which laws apply to Bitcoin — or even on what Bitcoin is. The person behind the recent scheme, a trader known on Twitter as Fontas, said in a secure Internet chat that he operated with little fear of a crackdown. “For now, the lack of regulations allows everything to happen,” Fontas said in the chat, where he verified his control of the Twitter account, which has thousands of followers, but did not give his identity. He added that Bitcoin and its users would benefit when someone steps in to police this financial wild west, and would stop his schemes when they do. Chinese authorities drew attention to the issue on Thursday when they announced that they were barring Chinese banks from making Bitcoin transactions. The same day, the Bank of France issued its own warning about the potential risks. The news sent the price of Bitcoin tumbling, but it quickly bounced back to near its all-time high of around $1,200. Bitcoins are little more than computer code — created according to a set algorithm and traded between online wallets using virtual keys. Some people insist that virtual currencies could become a revolutionary new form of payment in the real world. Bank of America became the first major Wall Street bank to release research about Bitcoin on Thursday, noting that it could become “a major player in both e-commerce and money transfer.” So far, though, Bitcoin has been driven up primarily by people who are betting it will rise and rise because there is a finite supply. The initial computer program established that only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. Because there are no limits on who can buy Bitcoins, they have attracted investors of all stripes. The value of all the Bitcoins in existence is now more than $12 billion after a volatile surge increased the value by more than 1,000 percent over the last month. But the excitement over this rapid ascent has obscured the fraud, hacking and outright theft that have become an increasingly regular part of the virtual currency world — even for the most sophisticated, legitimate players — and the lack of any visible response from law enforcement agencies. This has allowed more than 30 episodes in which at least 1,000 Bitcoins — or $1 million at the current rate of exchange — were stolen or transferred illegally, according to a frequently updated list on the most popular online forum for Bitcoin. Of those cases, 10 involved losses of more than 10,000 Bitcoins, or $10 million at the current value. The authorities have only been publicly involved in one of these cases. This week, the virtual currency world has been abuzz over a heist in which 96,000 Bitcoins — currently worth about $100 million — were said to be taken from an online marketplace known for selling illegal drugs. Because of the murky nature of the virtual currency, thefts can be hard to verify. But the increasing stream of episodes underscores how quickly con artists can take advantage of new forms of investing and how slow the authorities can be in responding to emerging financial risks. The association of state securities regulators put digital money on its list of the top 10 threats to investors for the first time this year. At a hearing last month, three federal agencies said they were carefully tracking virtual currencies for illicit activity. But Judith M. Shaw, the top securities regulator in Maine, said that it was often hard to determine which authority should be cracking down on virtual currency fraud, or even what constitutes fraud in a market that some view as a giant bubble and others as the future of money. “The jurisdiction has not been clearly established because it’s new uncharted territory,” Ms. Shaw said. “Everyone is just trying to figure out how this is all going to play out.” The five Chinese agencies that released a notice on Thursday, including the People’s Bank of China, said that citizens of the country would still be allowed to buy and sell digital money, but it warned that participants “assume the risks themselves.” Authorities in the United States have cracked down on the criminal use of virtual currencies in a few cases, but those have been isolated situations in which the coins have been used for illegal purposes in the real world, like money laundering and trade in illicit goods. The owner of the Silk Road, a website where drugs and weapons could be bought with Bitcoins, was arrested earlier this year. But for crimes contained within the Bitcoin network — like thefts from apparently reputable online wallets where Bitcoins are stored — there has been almost no accountability. The largest Bitcoin payment processor in Europe, BIPS, said last month that it was hacked and that it lost about $1 million worth of Bitcoins, including coins that were in the personal online wallets of customers. The company, which is still in business, said this week that it would be “unable to reimburse Bitcoins lost unless the stolen coins are retrieved.” The company said that the Danish police were examining the case but added that the authorities could “not classify this as a theft due to the current nonregulation of Bitcoin.” “There is absolutely no consumer protection in any sector of the Bitcoin economy,” said Sarah Meiklejohn, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, who researches the industry. After writing a paper on Bitcoin transactions this year, Ms. Meiklejohn said she began receiving emails almost daily from victims of theft who asked her to help track down the perpetrators. Ms. Meiklejohn said that despite the long odds of success, she had generally offered to help, knowing that the victims had nowhere else to turn. “I figure I can at least respond to them and provide some sense they are being heard,” Ms. Meiklejohn said. Part of the problem is that regulators have not agreed on how to classify Bitcoin. The Securities and Exchange Commission has authority to regulate securities, like stocks, in the United States. This allowed the agency to punish a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme this year because the agreement between the swindler and the victims was considered a security. But so far, the agency has not determined whether Bitcoin itself can be categorized as a security, making it hard for it to crack down on trading fraud. Chinese authorities said on Thursday that Bitcoin was a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency.” In the United States, that classification could put Bitcoin under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But that agency has not assumed responsibility. In the immediate future, the most likely source of enforcement may be the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s cybersecurity team. “It’s becoming something of enough value that these agencies are going to wake up and want to find one of these thieves,” said Patrick Murck, the general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes virtual currencies. “There is no way that anyone can think this is not a real thing that is not worth going after.”",-0.07929583333333333,0.033207289913019085

Regulators have barred the country’s banks from trading Bitcoin, while denying the pseudo-money legal status and cracking down on anonymous users. Though China has stopped short of an outright ban, the move dashes hopes the country might allow start-up currencies to exist alongside the official renminbi. China’s crackdown is by far the most decisive by the world’s financial regulators to date. That’s probably because enthusiasm for Bitcoin appears to have been greater there than in any other single country. Data from online exchanges suggests that China has in recent weeks accounted for around a third of global trading volume. For a while, Chinese Bitcoin buyers were also paying a significantly higher price for their virtual stash than users outside the Middle Kingdom. Though China has not made Bitcoin illegal, the directive from the People’s Bank of China severely limits its potential uses. It is a “virtual good” without legal status. Financial institutions are banned from trading it – a significant step in a country where banks will accept copper and rubber as collateral for loans. Moreover, the People’s Bank of China has taken steps to limit the anonymity that makes Bitcoin appealing as a means of exchange in illicit deals — or as a way around China’s capital controls. The regulatory assault undermines the narrative that Bitcoin is in the vanguard of a global shift toward new, computer-generated forms of money. With that new monetary age paradigm looking shaky, the virtual asset has lost a good portion of its speculative appeal. The price of Bitcoin on BTC China, the country’s leading exchange, fell by about 20 percent following the ruling. Devotees will still insist that government restrictions cannot undermine an asset that was devised as an alternative to state-controlled fiat currencies. It also remains to be seen whether other countries will adopt the same hard line. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s true believers are having their faith tested.

The Chinese government on Thursday moved to restrict banks from using Bitcoin in transactions, declaring that it was not a true currency at all, The New York Times reports. A notice issued by the People’s Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies said the step was needed to “protect the status of the renminbi as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability.” The price of Bitcoin, which has surged in recent months and is characterized by bouts of volatility, dropped on the news. After reaching a high of $1,240, the price fell to around $1,085 on Thursday, at one point touching a low of $870, according to the Mt.Gox exchange.  The notice in China said Bitcoin was “not a currency in the real meaning of the word” but rather a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.” At the same time, China said that investors were free to speculate on Bitcoin at their own risk. “Ordinary members of the public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin transactions as a kind of commodity trading activity on the Internet, provided they assume the risks themselves,” the statement said. The announcement had outsize significance for Bitcoin fans because China has quickly become one of the hottest markets for the virtual currency. Chinese transactions in Bitcoin far outstripped activity in euros in November, even at the height of the American and European trading days, according to an analysis by a site called Fiatleak. A year ago, China was barely involved in Bitcoin at all. This map helps illustrate the craze.  The venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners was even betting that Beijing would endorse Bitcoin, noted The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog. Bitcoin fever was particularly intense in the city of Wenzhou. But while hopes of a Chinese seal of approval have been dashed, Bitcoin is gaining some institutional respect in the United States. In a move that appears to be unique among Wall Street firms, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has begun to cover Bitcoin, saying in a research report on Thursday that it could be useful in e-commerce and money transfers. “We believe Bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers,” said the report by Bank of America currency strategists led by David Woo. “As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth, in our view.” The report, which offered a primer on Bitcoin and described how it is “mined,” said that a “fair value analysis” of the currency suggested a maximum value of $1,300. At the same time, however, Bitcoin has “considerable shortcomings which we believe will ultimately hinder it from ascending to international currency status,” the report said. “Bitcoin’s role as a store of value can compromise its viability as a medium of exchange. Its high volatility, a result of speculative activities, is hindering its general acceptance as a means of payments for online commerce,” according to the report. The Bank of America report comes on the heels of positive comments by United States government officials. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress last month that currencies like Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise,” helping send the price higher. Still, some monetary policy experts are skeptical. Unlike conventional currencies, Bitcoin is not backed by a central bank or government. Nout Wellink, the former president of the Dutch Central Bank, recently told students at the University of Amsterdam that the Bitcoin craze was reminiscent of the mania over tulips that hit Amsterdam in the early 17th century, according to The Guardian. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, was blunt in his assessment.   “It’s a bubble,” he told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. “It has to have intrinsic value. You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven’t been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.”",0.21115937499999998,0.08026627886002886

The action comes as monetary authorities around the world have begun to confront the issue of Bitcoin, a virtual currency whose value has soared in recent months as interest in it has spread. Part of its rise has been driven by intense demand for the virtual currency in China. The notice curtailing financial institutions’ involvement with Bitcoin was issued by the People’s Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies, and the directive said the step was needed to “protect the status of the renminbi as the statutory currency, prevent risks of money laundering and protect financial stability.” The notice said that Bitcoin was “not a currency in the real meaning of the word” but was rather a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.” Last month, in a sign of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance, American regulatory officials told a Senate hearing that financial networks like Bitcoin offered tangible benefits for the financial system. But they warned of the potential for money laundering and other criminal activity associated with such networks. The remarks by United States officials, along with wider acceptance of the virtual currency by merchants, had helped propel the value of the virtual currency beyond $1,100, leaving its total worldwide value at more than $11 billion. It dropped more than $100 on Thursday, according to the Mt.Gox exchange, which handles Bitcoin trading online, to $1,100 from $1,217. Bitcoin was established in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Part of the value of the currency is attributable to its limited supply. A maximum of 21 million units can be created, leading investors to bid up the price as demand grows. But with the growing acceptance of the virtual currency has come increasing concerns about its potential use in illicit transactions. In October, the American authorities arrested Ross Ulbricht, the alleged founder of the online marketplace Silk Road, after claiming that the site was being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. Bitcoin was the primary form of payment on Silk Road, where people could make purchases anonymously. The Chinese move came after officials in Beijing had expressed some support for the legitimacy of Bitcoin. Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China and the director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said in November that although the virtual currency might not find favor with China’s central bank, people should be free to participate in the Bitcoin market. That sentiment was echoed in the announcement Thursday. “Ordinary members of the public have the freedom to participate in Bitcoin transactions as a kind of commodity trading activity on the Internet, provided they assume the risks themselves,” the statement said. In China, Bitcoin was starting to gain favor even among merchants. In the Chaoyang district in Beijing, a restaurant started accepting Bitcoins for payment in defiance of earlier regulation stating that virtual currencies could not be used to purchase real-life goods or services. But in its statement Thursday, the Chinese central bank raised questions about whether Bitcoin could ever gain true legitimacy as legal tender: “In essence, Bitcoin is a kind of special virtual commodity, and does not have the same legal status as a currency.” “Currently, the public lacks sufficient understanding of Bitcoin, and some individuals have been caught up by faddishness or a speculative mentality in holding, using and trading in Bitcoins,” the statement said. The explanation said that Bitcoins possess “quite high speculative risks,” because of the relatively small market and 24-hour trading, with no curbs on market declines. It said: “The price can be easily controlled by speculators, creating severe turbulence and huge risks. Ordinary investors who blindly follow the crowd can easily suffer major losses.”",0.15855,0.07834697420634922

Exactly seven days ago, Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, was trading at about $615, but early Wednesday morning it had passed $1,000 on Mt.Gox, the leading Bitcoin exchange, setting a new high. This pushed Bitcoin’s market capitalization to over $11 billion. Not bad for a something that came out of thin air. But the rise of Bitcoin is not happening in a vacuum. It seems the value of almost all cryptocurrencies (and there are several dozen of them) has been growing rapidly over the last week. According to coinmarketcap.com, which monitors cryptocurrencies, Litecoin, a similar but more easily created currency, has risen 60 percent in the last 24 hours alone, bringing its market capitalization to $644 million. Another currency called PeerCoin is up 30 percent since Tuesday, now worth more than $75 million.
 The rise in pricing is most likely happening concurrently with the rise in attention. There are now more than 1.6 million references to Bitcoin in Google News, which monitors major news outlets around the world. According to Google Trends, which tracks search terms online, references to Bitcoin hit a record this week. And last week Bitcoin took a major step toward the mainstream as federal authorities signaled their willingness to accept it as a legitimate payment alternative. Bitcoin is also growing as it is becoming a more acceptable currency online. A number of Bitcoin investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have teamed up to create a “Bitcoin Black Friday,” where hundreds of retailers and charities, including OkCupid, an online dating service, City Wine Cellar, Reddit and GOOD Magazine, which promotes progress, will accept the currency on Black Friday. These other currencies are all vying to become the next Bitcoin, racing to be seen as a viable online alternative to cash. But not everyone is bullish on these currencies. Edward Hadas, economics editor at Reuters Breakingviews, says he thinks that Bitcoin, and, by proxy, other similar token-based denominations, will fail. “Bitcoin exemplifies some of the problems of private money: Its value is uncertain, its legal status is unclear, and it could easily become valueless if users lose faith,” Mr. Hadas wrote.

In a public statement distributed Wednesday, Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, computer scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said that after Dustin D. Trammell, a security consultant at Breakingpoint Systems Inc., in Austin, Tex., stated that he was the owner of a Bitcoin account that had been indirectly linked to a transaction on the Silk Road, they no longer believed that the designer of the Bitcoin system, an anonymous individual who identified himself as Satoshi Nakamoto, generated the transaction. In October, The F.B.I. arrested a 29-year-old San Francisco man, Ross William Ulbricht, and charged him with operating the the market for illicit goods and a murder-for-hire scheme under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts.”  Mr. Ulbricht  has both denied that he was the operator of the service and that he is the individual who used the moniker according to his attorney, Joshua L. Dratel. Bitcoin, which is designed to allow individuals to make transactions directly without financial intermediaries, has attracted significant attention recently because of the challenges of regulating the system. In a posting on his website, Mr. Trammell noted that he was neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor was he the individual who had conducted a transaction using the Silk Road service. In their statement, Dr. Ron and Dr. Shamir said that drawing a link between the designer of Bitcoin service and the operator of the Silk Road had not been the main intent of their research.  They wrote: “When we noticed the existence of this very short path (which apparently was not previously known to the bitcoin community), we decided to include it in our paper and predicted that “We are sure that analyzing this figure will start a very vigorous debate in the bitcoin community.” They noted that their prediction had turned out to be an understatement. The two researchers defended their methodology, known as “flow analysis,” stating: “If political leaders are found to have many common friends with Mafia dons, this is worth reporting even though it may have completely innocent interpretations. One should be careful not to present such connections as proofs of guilt, but this is often the only way to discover interesting things in large and complex data collections.” The discussion within the Bitcoin community since the publication of the paper has only deepened the puzzle of the transaction. A member of the Bitcoin community said it may have a variety of explanations. According to Meni Rosenfeld, a mathematician who is chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, one possibility is that the Silk Road service might have been run by a group, rather than an individual. This might explain why the F.B.I. has not been able to easily recover the additional Bitcoins.",0.10067000000000001,0.055124007936507936

They will fail, because money that is not issued by governments is always doomed to failure. Money is inevitably a tool of the state. Bitcoin relies on thoroughly contemporary technology. It consists of computer-generated tokens, with sophisticated algorithms guaranteeing the anonymity, transparency and integrity of transactions. But the monetary philosophy behind this web-based phenomenon can be traced back to one of the oldest theories of money. Economists have long declared that currencies are essentially a tool to increase the efficiency of barter, which they consider the foundation of all organized economic activity. In this view, money is a convenient instrument used by individuals to get things done. It is not inherently part of the apparatus of government. I think of the concept of privately issued tender as “right money,” because the whole idea appeals instinctively to right-wing thinkers. They dislike centralized authority of all sorts, including monetary authority. For example, Friedrich Hayek, Margaret Thatcher’s favorite economist, proposed replacing the state’s monopoly on legal tender with competing currencies offered by rival banks. Mr. Hayek presumably would have approved of bitcoin. The currency’s issuer is an unknown computer programmer, about as far from a government as can be imagined. Right now, bitcoin is tiny; at the current exaggerated exchange rate, the total projected volume of “coins” is worth less than the gross domestic product of Mongolia. Still, Mr. Hayek might well have dreamed of bitcoins becoming a global currency for wages, prices and loans. He would, though, have hoped for a more stable value, not the increase from $13 to $900 per bitcoin in less than a year. But the right-money historical narrative is simply wrong, as the anthropologist David Graeber explains in his book ”Debt: The First 5,000 Years.” Straightforward barter played a tiny role in all premodern economies. Instead, what we think of as purely economic activity was inseparable from an intricate structure of social relationships and spiritual beliefs. Purely commercial activity was rare — and it almost always relied on some form of government-issued money. Barter was not the precursor to money; it has always been the inferior alternative. So it is not surprising that barter economies only develop when governments break down. Similarly, truly private money is an inferior alternative to the money that comes with the backing of a political authority. After all, no bank or bitcoin-emitter can be as public-minded as a government, and no private power can raise taxes or pass laws to unwind monetary excesses. In short, while the freedom promised by right money may be ideologically appealing, monetary relations are too closely interwoven with other economic, political and social relations to be managed well by any institution with less sway than a government. The detailed work of money creation can be delegated to independent central banks and to a credit system of regulated private banks, but the ultimate authority of any functioning monetary system will always be the ultimate political authority. Bitcoin exemplifies some of the problems of private money: Its value is uncertain, its legal status is unclear, and it could easily become valueless if users lose faith. Besides, if bitcoin ever really started to take off, governments would either ban it or take over the system. The authorities might be motivated by a genuine concern about the stability of a shadow monetary system or they might act out of self-preservation. Tax evasion would be too easy in a right-money parallel economy. Mr. Hayek thought left-wing thinkers ignored the dangers of big government. He may have been right, but his idealism cannot overturn reality. All effective money is state-backed — what could be called “left money.” Of course, the global monetary system has suffered from appalling management in recent years. The authorities, especially in the United States, first allowed banks to act almost as if they were in a right-money world, lending and speculating wildly. That led to a typical right-money disaster — a sudden loss of trust and the failure of leading institutions. The authorities rescued the financial system, but their monetary system still cannot provide steady support to the rest of the economy. The outcome could have been much worse. Banks are still in business and consumer inflation rates are generally low. Still, the typical current combination of low interest rates, large government deficits and high ratios of debt to G.D.P. amounts to an invitation to monetary accidents. Part of the interest in virtual currencies like bitcoin is that their anonymity can provide a convenient cloak for criminal activity. Part is technological — this is a cool idea. And part is speculative — gamblers bet that bitcoin’s value will increase. But I suspect another important factor is political: Bitcoin appeals because governments are not fully living up to the responsibility that comes with state-sponsored money. Bitcoin, or something like it, will thrive until the authorities do better.

307,If Fund Managers Back Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/fund-managers-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-28T00:26:51+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A few years ago, I asked a friend at a major Wall Street trading desk if her colleagues ever talked about cryptocurrencies. She responded that one person would occasionally bring up Bitcoin, then the room would clear out. This was during Wall Street’s “Bitcoin is stupid” period, which fell between the initial, “I don’t understand it” era and the more recent “it’s a bubble” phase. Since the advent of the first cryptocurrency nine years ago, professional money managers have almost universally dismissed it as a potential investment. Although many have come around on the power of the underlying technology, cryptocurrencies have often been ignored or ridiculed. Last year, as the price gains of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether were generating daily headlines, some fund managers went on the attack, calling the sector a pyramid scheme. Although they probably really felt that way, they might have also been a little jealous. Wall Street money managers are not used to standing on the sidelines while amateurs get rich off something the pros don’t really understand, or worst yet, own. For the crypto faithful on the other hand, it’s always been a question of when, not if, the rest of the world catches on. Their faith (despite the volatility) has put them on the right side of a powerful investment thesis, one best phrased as a question: What happens when institutional money managers, who collectively control most of the world’s investment capital, enter a new asset class for the first time? The answer lies in basic math. Institutions control so much money that they own half a trillion dollars’ worth of Apple alone, and that’s just one stock within a single asset class. If all the hedge funds and family offices out there decided to commit a fraction of that capital to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, they may double the size of the sector. I’ve been making that argument to friends who work in institutional finance for years, but they’ve always brushed me off, and for good reason. Contrary to what an outsider might think, people who manage other people’s money don’t base their decisions on how to maximize returns. Their first consideration is whether they could justify their actions should something go wrong. This is a smart way for individual managers to make investment decisions, even if the combined effect is a lot of groupthink and the familiar cycle of booms and busts. Traders who lost money in mortgages in 2007 still have a job today because most of their colleagues also blew up in that trade. That attitude is one reason no career-minded professional has wanted to be the first to dip toes into crypto. Or the second, or the 12th. Not if they wanted to have a long career. But with each passing month, as more people talk about Bitcoin and more conferences are held where more products aimed at institutions are introduced, the barrier to entry gets a little lower. Every chain reaction starts small and needs the help of at least one catalyst. The adoption of the crypto-asset class by institutional investors has recently enjoyed several, the biggest of which is the introduction of infrastructure that solves the crypto-custodian problem. Since blockchain technology gives cryptocurrencies certain physical properties, storage is a significant issue. An institution that invests in stocks doesn’t have to worry about a hacker infiltrating their servers to steal shares, but in crypto, that kind of thing happens all the time. Several solutions to this problem have been introduced by reputable crypto companies in recent months, including hardware products that help institutions secure their own cryptocurrencies and a storage service where a third party does it for them. Then there are the recently introduced Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. These products allow institutions to gain exposure to crypto markets while bypassing the storage issue altogether. As an added bonus, their creation signaled a much-needed nod of approval from financial regulators, as did Goldman Sachs’ decision to help clients trade them. None of this means that the world’s pension funds and endowments are about to dive in. But for the bullish thesis to work, they don’t have to. Just the fact that they will start to consider the option is a major change. Throw in a sputtering stock market and a stalled bull market in bonds, and the argument becomes even more compelling. On Wall Street, the only sin worse than being the first in a bad trade is being the last in a good one, or what crypto enthusiasts colloquially call FOMO — or fear of missing out. That fear drives a lot of investment booms, and nobody knows that better than the biggest stewards of institutional money: hedge funds. Twenty years ago, most people had never even heard of “alternative assets.” Then the dot-com bubble burst, leading the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, and it was no longer possible for pension funds and endowments to hit their annual return targets with only stocks and bonds. Within a few years, everyone was talking about the importance of allocating some capital to so-called absolute-return strategies, and the hedge fund boom was born. We are still years away from when institutional investors will fully embrace crypto as an asset class, but 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the tipping point.",0.11225526315789473,0.098866677651922
308,Much Ado About Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/much-ado-about-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-11-27T00:47:39+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"FOR the obsessive followers of the volatile virtual currency bitcoin, the price of a single bitcoin at the time their fixation began holds undue significance. I know one bitcoin cost around $9 when I first stumbled on it in the summer of 2011. That was before I single-handedly sent the price of bitcoin soaring.  I wasn’t trying to manipulate an underground economy. I was just doing my job as a blogger for the website Gawker when I broke the story of the online underground illegal drug market Silk Road, on which bitcoin was the only accepted currency because of its relative anonymity. The article went viral and introduced hundreds of thousands to bitcoin.  Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, helped, too. During a news conference a couple of days after my article was published, he called bitcoin “an online form of money laundering.” I suppose a lot of people thought that sounded pretty cool. The price of bitcoin surged to $14. Huh, I thought, maybe I should buy some bitcoin. But I didn’t, and as of this writing, one bitcoin is worth around $880. Senate hearings held to discuss regulating bitcoin earlier this month were “lovefests,” according to The Washington Post. Abroad, Chinese investors are flocking. Bitcoin seems on the brink of respectability.  Still, there’s a zaniness about the currency. Bitcoin is built on a weird mix of the most old-fashioned kind of speculative greed, bolstered by a contemporary utopian cyberlibertarian ideology. Boosters say that bitcoin is the currency of the future. I’d argue that the phenomenon is a digital gold rush perfectly emblematic of the present.  Some of bitcoin’s appeal comes from the fact that it does not physically exist. Each bitcoin is just a string of numbers. Instead of a bank, a decentralized network of computers ensures the authenticity of bitcoin and issues new ones by doing complex calculations. This allows bitcoin to be traded peer to peer, bypassing credit card companies and payment processors. It’s digital cash, offering the same relative anonymity and freedom as a paper sack of bills. WikiLeaks began accepting bitcoin donations in 2011 in order to bypass PayPal and credit card companies, which had frozen payments to the organization.  The WikiLeaks episode hints at the utopian promise built into bitcoin by its creator, a mysterious programmer called Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is a subject of dispute and intrigue. The ideas behind bitcoin can be traced to a 1988 tract called the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which loftily predicted a future where anonymity-protecting technology made state control of the market impossible. Everything would be for sale to anyone all the time, 100 percent tax-free. Many of bitcoin’s hard-core fans see the currency as a revolutionary step toward this anarchocapitalist wonderland. I’m skeptical. I don’t think we’ll all be paying in bitcoin for tickets to Kanye West’s 2024 presidential victory tour. You can’t use bitcoin for much today besides gambling in online casinos and reserving seats on Virgin Galactic spaceflights, and a vast majority of it is held by speculators. Even with the imprimatur of government regulation, the promise of bitcoin seems to end with helping online retailers avoid credit-card processing fees. Bitcoin is mainly innovative in the way of credit default swaps: new ways to gamble with money. Bitcoin is most interesting on an emotional level. Its sheen of technomagic has let uber-rational geeks treat the casino-floor frenzy as a serious technological story. Tech blogs breathlessly track the price of bitcoin. Each new business that accepts bitcoin is heralded with the fanfare of a despot opening his country’s borders to a new, previously outlawed luxury. The drumbeat suggests that getting rich is as simple as being an early adopter.  So many have bought in because the Internet is very good at stoking the fear of missing out. There’s even a trendy acronym, FOMO, to describe the anxiety inspired by scrolling through the social media accounts of people having more fun than you. Bitcoin fosters a particularly potent brand of FOMO. Recently there was the story of the Norwegian 20-something who discovered that his long-forgotten bitcoin, bought for basically nothing, was worth so much that he traded some of it to buy an apartment. Bitcoin holders have taken to posting screenshots of their swollen accounts. I know a guy who bought a few hundred dollars’ worth of bitcoin as a sort of joke years ago. Now he’s made enough to buy a nice car.  All I can say is that the crash is going to be great. Bitcoin is too dependent on speculative mania to be of practical use as a currency. But as a symbol of the misguided dream that one can tap into the global data stream and download riches like a pop song, it’s gold.",0.13566326530612244,0.07961421798156493

It seems you can’t open a newspaper or read a website these days without hearing about the super-yet-mysterious virtual currency known as bitcoin.  Everyone’s talking about it. Richard Branson just began accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for flights on Virgin Galactic, which offers commercial spaceflights. The Chinese website Baidu endorsed the currency, and lawmakers in Washington are holding hearings about it. Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told senators in a letter that virtual currencies “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” And then, of course, there is the sky-high march of the value of bitcoin. A year ago, bitcoin was worth a couple of bucks. Today bitcoin goes for $800 each, depending on the day. And the value can swing by more than $100 a day, if not more. If it all feels a bit like a 1999-style craze, that’s because it is. Peter Leeds of the Penny Stock newsletter put it to me this way: “In a matter of months you won’t be hearing about it. It will go the same way of Paris Hilton. People will move on to the next thing.” That’s not to say there aren’t fervent believers. Bitcoin’s early success was a result, in part, of an angry libertarian strain of investor looking for an alternative to the dollar, something akin to a digital version of gold, in the event the world comes to an end — or starts to look like a Keanu Reeves movie. But there seems to be a disconnect between the idea of what makes a great investment — or a great speculation — and a new currency that will be universally accepted. Bitcoin, in the short or even long term, may turn out be a good investment in the same way that anything that is rare can be considered valuable. Like baseball cards. Or a Picasso. That’s because there are only so many of them. But bitcoin aspires to be much more than a collectible, or frankly, even gold. It aspires to be a universal electronic currency. On that score, it is unlikely to succeed. Why? Let’s start with bitcoin’s value — or more accurately, the volatility of its value. Which merchants in their right mind are going to accept a currency that seemingly changes its value in wild swings every other day? Mr. Branson’s experience with bitcoin is instructive: While he happily accepted bitcoin as a form of payment, he quickly converted the payment into dollars. That doesn’t make bitcoin a currency. It makes it a way for merchants, like Shopify — which also accepts bitcoin — to get a little publicity. Then there is the issue of how limited the supply of bitcoin truly is. Bitcoin is digitally “mined” by computers running an algorithm. (If you just rolled your eyes, you’re not alone.) The algorithm limits the total number of bitcoin ever mined to 21 million units. But there is no Bernanke (or Janet Yellen) of bitcoin. Nobody knows who created it and no one controls it. That’s supposed to be a benefit. It’s also why the currency is often associated with illicit sales. Bitcoin can be transferred anonymously and without banks taking transaction fees. But if, and this is a big if, your peer-to-peer transaction doesn’t work properly, there is no central clearinghouse to complain to. Whether the government ultimately seeks to regulate bitcoin is an open question. It seems hard to believe that the government would allow the growth of such an unregulated market in which moms and pops, widows and orphans, and other individuals may be subject to all kinds of fraud. Oddly, the Chinese government has seemingly embraced the early use of bitcoin. Gordon G. Chang, writing in Forbes, has a provocative explanation for that stance: “Digital money can undermine the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. Bitcoin is on track to becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar nonfiat form of money.” Finally, there is the question of what happens if other alternative digital currencies also rise. More than a dozen digital currencies are trying to compete with bitcoin. Can you imagine a world in which we all transact with dozens of different currencies every day with different rules? Neither can I. “Every big idea starts out sounding crazy. But not every crazy-sounding idea ends up being big,” Matthew O’Brien wrote in The Atlantic in a brilliant takedown of bitcoin. In truth, the best bitcoin can hope for is to be a second-rate version of gold, if that. And Warren Buffett once described gold this way: “Gold gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.” That’s pretty much the way a Martian might think about bitcoin.",0.1771156862745098,0.06817233964292789

For Lawrence Blankenship, it’s already a thing of the past.  A software engineer from Springfield, Mo., Mr. Blankenship is putting his money on PeerCoin, one of the biggest of the virtual currencies that are being promoted as alternatives to bitcoin. With mounting interest from prominent investors and growing acceptance from regulators, bitcoin — either the new gold or the next Dutch tulip craze, depending on who is being asked — is at the center of the virtual money universe. Yet there are dozens of digital alternatives, like PeerCoin, Litecoin and anoncoin, whose backers point to advantages they say their currency has over bitcoin.

On one popular exchange, Cryptsy, 60 different coins can now be traded. Almost all of these altcoins, as they are known, have fed on the stratospheric rise of bitcoin. Since the beginning of the month, the value of bitcoin rose to more than $900 at one point, from $200, and it is up 6,000 percent since the beginning of the year. Many of the altcoins have risen at the same clip, driven by bets that the Internet has room for more than one form of virtual money, or that bitcoin can be overtaken. The constant innovation opens the door to new opportunities for fraud and illegal activities. Thanks to a lack of regulation, pump-and-dump schemes have become common. But the thousands of hours being poured into these projects underscore the degree to which a small but growing community believes that it has found the future of money. “It’s a very intriguing thing, because in principle, you can have a kind of money with some advantages that have never been possessed by any past forms of money,” said George Selgin, an economics professor at the University of Georgia at Athens. If this is a contest, bitcoin is still light-years ahead of any of its competitors — the value of all bitcoin is measured in the billions of dollars, while only a few others have even cracked a hundred million. And bitcoin has the basic attributes that most other coins are trying to imitate: an open-source computer code with no central authority and a mathematically determined rate of expansion, not relying on a central bank. What’s more, most altcoins share the biggest weakness of bitcoin: a violently fluctuating value. Most people are willing to use real currencies because they have stable values that make them good units of exchange. Virtual currencies, these days, are more like speculative commodities. But this is not stopping the ascent of things like Litecoin, which is generally viewed as the second-most-popular digital money, with a total value of about $250 million last week. Unlike bitcoin, which was invented by a shadowy creator known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, Litecoin was created by Charles Lee, a 36-year-old former programmer at Google who lives with his wife and two children in Silicon Valley. Mr. Lee said he wrote the original code for Litecoin in the hours after his children had gone to sleep. At the time, he said, many of the new currencies were being created by people who kept large hoards of the money they created, and then cashed out as soon as it rose in value. Mr. Lee, by contrast, gave advance notice of Litecoin’s release, and on that day he began with no coins himself. Like bitcoin, new Litecoin is created through a so-called mining process in which computers compete to solve math problems, with coins going to the first computer that succeeds. The goal with Litecoin, Mr. Lee said, was not to replace bitcoin. Instead, it was to be “silver to bitcoin’s gold,” with faster-moving transactions and a more democratic mining process. “People like choices,” said Mr. Lee, who now works for Coinbase, a company that provides virtual currency wallets. “You want to diversify your crypto-currency investments.”   Another virtual currency viewed as being in the top ranks is Ripple, which is at the center of a new online payment system also called Ripple. This has won some mainstream following because it has big Silicon Valley backers and promises to be more transparent and easier to regulate than bitcoin. Bitcoin has been criticized for the anonymity of its transactions, which have made it attractive for buying drugs and guns online. But many altcoin fans are more bothered by how easily governments can follow bitcoin, because the transactions are all recorded on a public ledger. This was the motivation for the creators of anoncoin, which has been rising in value. Not surprisingly, the person behind anoncoin’s email address did not want to share his or her identity. But the person, going by the name Meeh, said the team behind anoncoin was “just people trying to help people become anonymous in this over-surveillanced world.” PeerCoin, Mr. Blankenship’s money of choice, also has a creator who refuses to be identified, going by the name Sunny King. In an Internet chat, Sunny King said one of the goals with PeerCoin was to create money that did not require the same computer resources to mine — making it more environmentally sustainable. More recently, Sunny King released a second new currency, Primecoin, that forces miners to find new strings of prime numbers — a potentially valuable task for the mathematical world. “We are not greedy,” Sunny King said. “We think crypto-currency also needs moral character behind it.” Mr. Blankenship is pushing for Sunny King’s currencies and so are some friends in Springfield. One of those friends, John Manglaviti, said he dedicated 30 hours a week to promoting PeerCoin, after his day job, and thinks it could be “right there as an alternative to bitcoin.” First, though, he said, the “challenge is to take this out of the geek world and make it something my mom could use.” ",0.26374074074074066,0.12005658436213992
312,Study Suggests Link Between Dread Pirate Roberts and Satoshi Nakamoto,https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/study-suggests-link-between-dread-pirate-roberts-and-satoshi-nakamoto/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-11-23T23:13:03+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt," Dorit Ron, a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute, and Adi Shamir, a pioneering cryptographer who is a member of the  applied mathematics faculty at the Institute, will publish a paper Sunday exploring how the 29-year-old Mr. Ulbricht, who was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October and has been charged with a murder-for-hire scheme and  narcotics-trafficking, acquired and protected the estimated millions he made in commissions operating Silk Road. The researchers say Silk Road, at the time of Mr. Ulbricht’s arrest, had sales of $1.2 billion, generating $80 million in commissions. A huge run-up in the value of bitcoin in the last month has exponentially increased those amounts.  However, the researchers added, they believe the F.B.I. has seized only about 22 percent of the commissions they have identified, and that they  themselves have only been able to trace about a third of the total. The Silk Road site, which has been called an “eBay for drugs” was intended to permit any kind of anonymous transaction between buyers and sellers of illegal goods or activities. It was shut down  when the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Ulbricht, who used the Internet identity “Dread Pirate Roberts,” while he was sitting in a public library in San Francisco near his home. The two scientists have been exploring the web of financial transactions produced by bitcoin, the anonymous currency that  has drawn the attention of both law enforcement and federal regulators in recent months. Their research is made possible by the fact that while bitcoin is designed to protect the anonymity of buyers and sellers, the actual transactions are public. Earlier this year, the researchers obtained a complete listing of all bitcoin transactions and have since been exploring the “graph” of those interactions in an attempt to gain statistical insights into user behavior in the anonymous financial market. After Mr. Ulbricht was arrested last month, the scientists used public information to begin tracing Silk Road-related transactions. Among their discoveries was a particular transfer to an account controlled by Mr. Ulbricht from another that had been created in January 2009, during the very earliest days of the bitcoin network, which was set up the previous year. Although the authors state that they cannot prove that that account belongs to the person who created the bitcoin currency, it is widely believed that the first accounts belong to a person who identifies himself as “Satoshi Nakamoto,” but who has remained anonymous and has not been publicly heard from since 2010. Individual bitcoin is generated using a cryptographic algorithm that requires computer-processing power and that insures that each coin remains unique and cannot be copied. After seizing Mr. Ulbricht’s computer, the F.B.I. spent several weeks analyzing data, determining that the laptop contained a digital wallet with 144,336 bitcoin, currently valued at more than $122 million, which the agency has attempted to freeze. In tracing various transactions made to and from Mr. Ulbricht’s account, the authors found an intriguing one involving the transfer of 1,000 bitcoin, which would have been worth $60,000 when it was made on March 20 of this year, but is now worth roughly $847,000. They write: “Such a single large transfer does not represent the typical behavior of a buyer who opens an account on Silk Road in order to purchase some narcotics (such buyers are expected to make an initial deposit of tens or hundreds of dollars, and to top the account off whenever they buy additional merchandise). It could represent either large-scale activity on Silk Road, or some form of investment or partnership, but this is pure speculation.” The mysterious account that made the investment had at one point accumulated 77,600 bitcoin, mostly through “mining” operations, an amount which would now be worth approximately $64 million. “The short path we found suggests (but does not prove) the existence of a surprising link between the two mysterious figures of the bitcoin community, Satoshi Nakamoto and DPR,” the authors write, referring to Mr. Ulbricht as the Dread Pirate Roberts. In addition to the curious transaction, which they say they cannot explain, the authors said they discovered that much of the bitcoin accumulated by Mr. Ulbricht has remained beyond the F.B.I.’s grasp. The scientists note that, for technical reasons, seizing and controlling bitcoin from a computer is a much greater challenge for law enforcement than illicitly obtained cash stored in a safe. With bitcoin, its very design may  make it possible for its support community to move to thwart law enforcement or any resale of  the digital tokens. In addition, the scientists speculated that the reason the F.B.I. had not recovered all Mr. Ulbricht’s bitcoin might be that he was using a second computer that has not been located. Dr. Ron and Dr. Shamir noted that despite the fact that the F.B.I. closed the original Silk Road black market, a second “Silk Road anonymous market” has been created since. Satoshi Nakamoto’s actual identity remains a hotly debated topic among Internet researchers. A number of individuals claim to have discovered his true identity, but those assertions have either been denied or ignored by those named. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",0.05354318181818182,0.051907016594516596

It doesn’t fit into a neat product category. Often called a virtual currency, it’s not legal tender anywhere on the planet. It’s not an income-generating asset class suitable for most investors. Its value, in dollars, fluctuates wildly from one minute to the next. And while it can be a cheap way of transferring money, there are too many glitches in its emerging network for bitcoin to be entirely reliable.  Even its advocates have been raising red flags. As Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to “fostering the bitcoin ecosystem,” acknowledged in a Senate hearing last week, “It’s very much still an experimental currency and it should be considered a high-risk environment for consumers and investors at the moment.” Yet bitcoin has been receiving plenty of attention, and not just because well-publicized speculators have been making money on it.  High-risk experiment though it may be, bitcoin embodies an elegant and disruptive technology. It uses file-sharing, the peer-to-peer computer innovation that spawned early music services like Napster, Kazaa and LimeWire. In their early days, they sometimes walked on the wild side, but their experiences led to a wholesale digital transformation of the music business.  Bitcoin gives file-sharing a brilliant twist. In essence, it has created “a decentralized virtual currency that uses a peer-to-peer consensus system to confirm and verify transactions,” two researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis concluded in a recent study. And François R. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, made this assessment in a new report on bitcoin: “It represents a remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions (which could issue their own bitcoins) or even by governments themselves.” Bitcoin’s advantages as a low-cost means of transferring money have intrigued a number of corporate clients of the law firm Proskauer, though none of them are using it, said Jeffrey D. Neuberger, co-chairman of the firm’s technology, media and communications group. “It’s an early-stage technology,” he said. “But it could be revolutionary.” In short, in a world that some people consider almost as important as music — the precincts of money and finance — bitcoin, or a successor technology that shares its DNA, is given a good chance of influencing the future.  That’s what made last week’s hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee so intriguing. It assessed the “potential risks, threats and promises of virtual currencies,” with bitcoin foremost among them. So what is bitcoin today? Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the committee, acknowledged that he wasn’t sure how to make sense of it: “Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others and confused the heck out of the rest of us, including me.”  The Senate committee’s attempt to get a grip on the digital currency was, in a way, the first step in what will surely be a continuing tension. On one side are those seeking ease and anonymity in transactions; on the other is the government.  Speculators and money launderers have already found much to like about the relatively anonymous digital currency, and that has forced the government to play catch-up. Bitcoin allowed the website Silk Road, which the government shut down  in October, to become “the largest illegal drug and contraband marketplace on the Internet,” according to Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. While it was in business, customers “were required to pay in bitcoins to enable both the operator of Silk Road and its sellers to evade detection and launder hundreds of millions of dollars,” she said. The virtual currency isn’t impervious to determined government snooping, however. “We are innovating as criminals are innovating,” said Mythili Raman, an acting assistant attorney general, at the hearing. Individual bitcoin transactions are encoded, but large numbers of them may be compared statistically with other databases available to the government, and patterns will emerge, several experts said. While bitcoin users need a secret, numerical key to unlock their accounts, the anonymity of the system is vulnerable when the virtual currency is exchanged into dollars. Federal and state authorities are requiring firms that exchange bitcoin into currency, or use it to transfer funds, to comply with existing regulations. But when the movement from bitcoin to hard currency takes place in a country where American authorities don’t have access, “there may be opportunities for money-laundering,” said Mr. Neuberger at Proskauer. The S.E.C., for its part, has been warning investors of the danger of “potential investment scams” involving bitcoin and other virtual currencies. In one case, it has charged Trendon T. Shavers, a Texas man, with running a bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme with the promise of vast riches. “Con men read the headlines like everyone else,” said Lori Schock, director of the S.E.C.’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. “Bitcoins sound sexy and new, but at the end of the day, if they’re making claims about limitless wealth from unregistered investments it comes down to an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.” The agency is also studying a legitimate bitcoin proposal by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the technology investors best known for their involvement with Facebook, to open an exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., that tracks the bitcoin market. If the E.T.F. is ever approved, a fund based on a volatile virtual currency is hardly likely to be a safe, core holding for buy-and-hold investors.  In the meantime, the virtual currency’s soaring value has inspired tales like this one: Kristoffer Koch, 29, of Oslo, told the BBC last month that he bought $22 worth of the currency while doing technical research on it four years ago. He promptly forgot about it. When he unlocked his long dormant account recently, it was worth $850,000.  Even with all of its problems, the eventual creation of a reliable, decentralized, peer-shared, computer-based currency remains the holy grail in some circles. Back in 1999, Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate who remains the guiding light of many libertarians, predicted its eventual arrival. He saw the Internet as a congenial environment for innovators. Markets would flourish in cyberspace, freeing people from what he considered the stifling grasp of a paternalistic and inefficient government. But one ingredient was missing, he said. He called it “a reliable e-cash.”  What was required, he said, was e-cash that enabled you to “transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A — the way in which I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you and there’s no record of where it came from. And you may get that without knowing who I am.”  Unfortunately, that would create new problems, he said, because such a currency would have “a negative side.” “The gangsters,” he said, “the people who are engaging in illegal transactions, will also have an easier way to carry on their business.”  That tension is part of progress, he said. It may be where we find ourselves now.",0.12830384615384613,0.0746683177933178

Speaking at an economic forum on Wednesday, Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China and director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said that it would be impossible for China’s central bank to recognize the Bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument in the near future. But, Mr. Yi added, people are free to participate in the Bitcoin market and he would personally adopt a long-term perspective on the currency.  The statement comes during a week of remarkable turbulence on China’s numerous Bitcoin exchanges. On BTC China, the world’s largest exchange platform for the digital currency, the value of a Bitcoin more than doubled from about 3,000 renminbi, or about $500, on Sunday to nearly 7,000 renminbi on Tuesday. By midday on Wednesday it was back below 4,000 renminbi and on Friday it was hovering around 5,000 renminbi. Such volatility in large part reflects uncertainty over how the Chinese government — as well as other governments — may decide to regulate the currency. As a result, even minor policy or media signals have triggered wild fluctuations in the currency’s value. Analysts suspect that the currency’s sharp rise on Tuesday came in response to the United States Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s letter to the United States Congress, in which he wrote that financial innovations like Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” Favorable media coverage on CCTV, China’s state-run broadcaster, has also pushed up the currency’s value. A segment that aired on Oct. 28 about the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, in Vancouver, precipitated a rise on China’s Bitcoin exchanges. Although Mr. Yi’s remarks were the most direct government statement to date, his words are far from conclusive. He stopped short of calling Bitcoin illegal and he explicitly stated that ordinary Chinese citizens retain the freedom to trade in Bitcoins, given its status as a form of online trading. At the same time, China has historically maintained very strict control over its currency, the renminbi, and some experts speculate that the government could still outlaw or restrict Bitcoin if it grows too large or proves socially or financially destabilizing. According to industry analysts, the government already has the legal grounds to crack down on Bitcoin, if it chooses. In 2009, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture jointly issued rules prohibiting both the use of virtual currency to purchase actual goods and services and the exchange of virtual currency for renminbi.",0.1567,0.08193086883876358

But in the real world, bitcoins seem mostly to serve people engaged in illegal activities or speculation.  At a congressional hearing earlier this week, federal officials responsible for policing financial crimes said that bitcoins and other virtual currencies used in transactions primarily online could be subject to government regulation, an idea that might bring these units into the financial mainstream. After the hearing, the price of bitcoins shot up roughly 50 percent, to $900. But less than 24 hours later, it had tumbled to less than $700. Bitcoins — software code generated by computers solving mathematical problems — are not tied to any national currency and are not backed by any government. But they have attracted a following among investors, technologists and criminals, who find them appealing because no centralized authority regulates them.  There are about 12 million bitcoins in existence now, and only 21 million units can ever be created. The limit is designed by the bitcoin creator or creators (known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto) to ensure that there would never be a glut of coins that would depress their value.  People can trade dollars and other real currencies for bitcoins on Internet exchanges. Users can transfer the digital coins without using banks and can use the bitcoins to pay for goods and services from merchants who take this currency; so far, that includes the dating site OkCupid and murky websites that sell illegal drugs and firearms. Bitcoin supporters assert that the virtual currency uses cryptography in ways that make it more secure than credit cards or payment services like PayPal. They also argue that bitcoin transactions are cheaper to conduct because the transfers do not have to go through banks and other financial middlemen.  Officials from the Treasury Department, the Secret Service and the Department of Justice acknowledge that virtual currencies are not illegal. But ensuring that businesses that use them comply with financial laws will remain a big challenge.

You can watch it trading across the globe, and possibly draw some intriguing conclusions about where this fast-moving digital money is going. For the last week, a site called fiatleak has offered a map that its creator says draws information from all the major online bitcoin exchanges, like Mt. Gox and BTC-e, and shows what country’s residents are buying bitcoins, in real time.  There are also sites that list all major bitcoin exchanges, but they don’t show it as a global phenomenon as vividly. One striking thing about the map: Bitcoin is increasingly a Chinese craze. Even at the height of the American and European trading days, when it’s 3 a.m. in China, Chinese transactions far outstrip activity in euros. The United States dollar transactions are still more popular than Chinese at that time, with about twice as many transactions. China was barely involved in bitcoin a year ago, however. The Chinese presence can also strengthen when it is daytime in China and night in the United States. “You can watch China and the U.S. play Ping-Pong on this,” said Andrew Hodel, who built the site. “You see the psychology, as the bitcoin goes over a threshold number in dollars or yuan.”  Other players, like people in Japan or Britain, barely figure into the exchanges. Russians do not apparently trade much, but that participation is masked by their activities in the euro-based market. The map also shows the value of bitcoin in the local currency, based on the most recent trade. By Monday evening, the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges. The total outstanding pool of bitcoin — which is created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems — is now worth more than $7 billion. Mr. Hodel is an American living in Uruguay who owns a small Internet service provider called Cobianet, operating in Texas and Colorado. He says he owns only about 10 bitcoins, but admits a fascination with the currency.  “It opened my eye to the fact that the U.S. isn’t as influential as I thought,” he said. “Bitcoin is a currency, a commodity and an accountancy built by developers that is completely decentralized. It’s fundamentally better.”  As to whether the huge influx of Chinese buyers could signal a bubble, Mr. Hodel said it proved the opposite. “Speculation from yuan buyers is running wild,” he said, “but bubbles are cultural reactions to a development. This is happening over all kinds of cultures.” Of course, that also raises the prospect that bitcoin is the first bubble currency of our new global digital culture. “That could be too,” Mr. Hodel said. “But that probably means it will bubble up, burst, and come back,” the way several currencies have in the past when they initially rise to pre-eminence.

Gox, a cryptocurrency exchange that helped establish Bitcoin as a household name before spectacularly imploding amid allegations of mismanagement. Still, Mark Karpelès, the French national who presided over Mt. Gox’s rise to become the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, will not serve additional time if he remains on good behavior. The verdict ended a more-than-five-year ordeal for Mr. Karpelès, who was found guilty on a charge of falsifying data but innocent of two additional charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He was arrested in August 2015 and held for almost a year in detention, where he spent months under interrogation by prosecutors who upped the pressure by adding more charges against him. His sentence was suspended for four years, effectively meaning he will serve no additional jail time as long as he remains on good behavior. Critics of Japanese justice said that Mr. Karpelès’s experience presented a case study in the system’s faults. Prosecutors first enlisted Mr. Karpelès to assist in investigating Mt. Gox’s loss of 850,000 Bitcoins, then valued at around half a billion dollars. Before long, their suspicions shifted to Mr. Karpelès himself. He apologized for “weaknesses in the system” but denied that he had taken any of his clients’ assets. His long detention is a common tactic in Japan, where nearly 99 out of 100 indictments end in conviction — an outcome sometimes obtained through confessions made under duress. In 2017, 88 percent of those who went to trial confessed, according to data maintained by Japan’s Supreme Court. That pattern has come under increased scrutiny since the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, then the chairman of Nissan, in November; he was held in jail and interviewed continually by prosecutors until this month, when he was granted bail. Mt. Gox started its life as a trading platform for the collectible card game Magic the Gathering before making a transition to cryptocurrency. Mr. Karpelès bought the company from its founder in 2011. Business exploded after the site was mentioned in an article explaining how to use Bitcoin to buy goods on Silk Road, a sort of eBay for black market goods, especially illegal drugs. At its height, nearly 70 percent of all Bitcoin transactions were said to flow through Mt. Gox’s servers. But the company had difficulty handling the demand. Plagued by technical and legal troubles, it declared bankruptcy in early 2014, after it was revealed to have lost track of more than 850,000 Bitcoins. Mr. Karpelès maintained throughout that he was innocent. And almost two years ago, prosecutors in the United States implicated someone else in the disappearance. In July 2017, American prosecutors indicted Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who they say received and laundered hacked funds from the company. He was arrested in Greece, where he has become the subject of an extradition battle among the United States, Russia and France. Mr. Vinnik’s lawyer has denied the charges against him. That indictment, Mr. Karpelès’s lawyer argued, helped established the innocence of his own client, who he said had worked to right the failed company. The judgment has closed one chapter in Mr. Karpelès story, but the fate of Mt. Gox remains open. The company still controls substantial cryptocurrency assets, though many claims against it remain outstanding, according to the trustee.",-0.05320243902439024,0.03975512969415408

And so it is with regulators in the rapidly evolving crypto space, who are coming up with wildly divergent ideas about what it is and how to regulate it. The tumult hit peak farce in a couple of televised congressional hearings in the winter and spring that the crypto crowd turned into memes. (One of the hearings made J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an overnight hero for his testimony calling for thoughtful regulation of cryptocurrencies, with some Reddit users calling for a Giancarlo coin.) But they haven’t produced clarity. Asked to describe the current state of crypto regulation in the United States, Perianne Boring, president and founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an industry group, said, “It’s unorganized and incredibly complicated, and it’s really putting the U.S. at risk of falling behind from an innovation and technology perspective. There are turf wars between the different regulatory agencies and turf wars between the feds and the states, and none of this is in the best interest of the U.S. or the blockchain technology industry.” Two of the biggest issues that touch an alphabet soup of regulators are securities law and taxation. Most pressing in the securities realm is the question of whether projects raising funds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether should be subject to federal registration and disclosure requirements. The fund-raising mechanism, known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., has made it easier for entrepreneurs to raise large sums of money without the hassles of regulators, investor protections or accountants. The coin offerings were inspired by initial public offerings, or I.P.O.s, that companies use to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don’t get an ownership stake in the projects. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it. So complex has the securities question become that some law firms have decided they are no longer able to give guidance on whether a unit of cryptocurrency — or token — sold in an I.C.O. would be deemed a security. (However, the S.E.C. did recently clarify that Ether, in its current form, is not a security, though the agency sidestepped the question of whether its crowdsale constituted a securities offering.) Or they are advising that clients sell their tokens outside the United States. Another option would be to force token issuers to structure all their sales as securities offerings. Two crypto unicorns, Coinbase and Circle, recently announced moves that would enable them to help customers buy and sell security tokens. The state of Wyoming has addressed the issue by passing laws that carve out a new category of what crypto enthusiasts typically call “utility tokens.” The Wyoming law stipulates such tokens cannot be marketed as investments, and the issuers need to make reasonable efforts to prevent buyers from buying tokens as an investment. While some experts say they believe the new Wyoming laws suggest a path forward, others are proposing self regulation. In a recent speech, Brian Quintenz, a C.F.T.C. commissioner, proposed “a private cryptocurrency oversight body,” or self-regulatory organization. Ms. Boring of the digital commerce chamber said, “It would have some oversight to a U.S. government agency or entity and congressional authority to levy fees and fines, and would have the actual teeth to be a regulator, but it would be an industry group.” Donna Faulk-White, a spokeswoman at the C.F.T.C., said in an email that in Mr. Giancarlo’s testimony on crypto assets to the Senate Banking Committee, he “expressed the view that policymakers should explore potential improvements to the existing patchwork approach to regulating spot markets for virtual currencies. Any such effort should be thoughtful and deliberative, however, which means that there is an opportunity for industry participants to develop standards that could inform policy discussions and benefit retail market participants.” “We are not yet in a position to suggest or advocate for legislation, but the chairman would view proper, effective and balanced self-regulatory efforts favorably,” Ms. Faulk-White said. Another area getting regulator’s attention is taxation. In late 2016, the Internal Revenue Service asserted that holders of crypto assets are evading taxes and asked for the data, even customer chat logs, on all of Coinbase’s users over three years, causing privacy advocates to protest. After a legal battle, in November 2017 a court restricted the order to customers who had more than $20,000 in annual transactions on the platform. In an email, the I.R.S. wrote, “The I.R.S. generally does not discuss its ongoing compliance efforts to avoid providing assistance to those taxpayers trying to avoid their tax obligations.” On the flip side, industry players complain that crypto assets are taxed as property, subject to capital gains tax, rather than as a currency, which is subject to ordinary income tax. To pay capital gains tax, users would have to record the dollar exchange rates for when they acquired their cryptocurrency and when they disposed of it — even for transactions in which, say, Bitcoin was used to pay for coffee. Ms. Boring said this had hampered the adoption of cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. “If those taxes didn’t exist where you have to report the valuation on every transaction, we would see a huge amount of activity and people using cryptocurrencies for payment,” she said. The chamber says cryptocurrencies and crypto assets should be taxed as an alternative to currency in the form of sales tax and income tax. Another blockchain advocacy group, Coin Center, supports a minimum exemption on transactions below $600 and also suggests that the I.R.S. make it easy for crypto exchanges to “give a right kind of reporting to their customers so they can easily report what they owe,” said Jerry Brito, the executive director. I.C.O. issuers also are unhappy with taxation. While some regulators say the tokens that issuers release are securities, the issuers don’t necessarily get the tax benefit that a company having an initial public offering would receive. “You’ve got the S.E.C. saying that things may be securities, but then your tax treatment isn’t treating you as though it’s a security,” Joshua Ashley Klayman of law firm Klayman LLC, said. “Your tax treatment is as though it’s property, so you’ve got the onerousness of something potentially being a security, but you don’t get the benefit from a tax perspective.” Among the many remaining regulatory issues surrounding crypto assets, are state and federal regulations. To operate nationwide, many crypto start-ups need to obtain what are called money transmission licenses from 53 states and territories. “There is still today, in March 2018, not one company that has been able to get money transmitter licenses across the entire United States,” Ms. Boring said. “It is a complete regulatory failure and breakdown.” Mr. Brito of Coin Center said going state by state was expensive, time-consuming and somewhat outdated for the internet era. Adding in the federal agencies, start-ups are required to deal with more than 60 regulators for the money transmission issue alone. “The state-by-state money transmission licensing regime makes no sense in a world where you have internet companies that are providing services not just on a national scale but a global scale,” he said. “It makes no sense to regulate them locality by locality, so we think a federal solution would be better.” However, no such proposal is in the works, and a so-called national “fintech charter” on the table at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, likely would not work for any but the most well-capitalized crypto companies, Mr. Brito said. The charter is a federal license that would enable money transmissions without having to get state licenses. “Good actors are trying to comply,” Ms. Klayman said. “If good actors can’t figure out how to comply, and feel safe about complying, then they’re going to consider avoiding the U.S. for their transactions.”",0.10041093749999999,0.01441186417748918

A number of federal officials told a Senate hearing that such financial networks offered real benefits for the financial system even as they acknowledged that new forms of digital money had provided avenues for money laundering and illegal activity.  “There are plenty of opportunities for digital currencies to operate within existing laws and regulations,” said Edward Lowery, a special agent with the Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the integrity of the dollar. Signs that the government would not stand in the way of bitcoin’s development, even as it has been cracking down on criminal networks that use the digital money, stoked a strong rally in the price of the crypto-currency. By Monday evening, the value of a bitcoin unit soared past $700 on some exchanges. The total outstanding pool of bitcoin — which is created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems — is now worth more than $7 billion. The Senate hearing Monday afternoon was the clearest indication yet of the government’s desire to grapple with the consequences of this growth, and the recognition that bitcoin and other similar networks could become more lasting and significant parts of the financial landscape. “The decision to bring virtual currency within the scope of our regulatory framework should be viewed by those who respect and obey the basic rule of law as a positive development for this sector,” said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. “It recognizes the innovation virtual currencies provide, and the benefits they might offer.” Ms. Shasky Calvery and the other officials at the hearing did say that basic questions still had to be answered about virtual currencies, including whether they can actually be considered currencies or whether they are more properly categorized as commodities or securities. The distinction will determine which agencies regulate the networks and how they are treated under tax law. Ms. Shasky Calvery said that the Internal Revenue Service was “actively working” on its own rules for bitcoin. The hearing followed other less visible steps taken by regulators and lawmakers to bring digital money into the mainstream. New York State’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, said last week that he would hold a hearing to consider the creation of a BitLicense to provide more oversight for transactions. Earlier, the Federal Election Commission put out an advisory indicating that bitcoin could be legally accepted as political donations. The general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit advocating the currency, said in his testimony on Monday that he was receiving a much more friendly response from both government and the financial industry. “We have recently perceived a marked improvement in the tone and tenor taken by both state officials and bank executives,” the general counsel, Patrick Murck, said. Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable ascent since it was created in 2009 by an anonymous programmer or collective known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The money, which is not tied to any national currency, has been popular with technophiles who are skeptical of the world’s central banks. Only a finite amount of bitcoin will ever be created — 21 million units. Users have bid up the price on Internet exchanges, betting that the currency will be more widely used in the future. There are significant questions about the wisdom of the digital money as an investment, given that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and has proved to be vulnerable to hackers. Many money managers have recommended that unsophisticated investors stay away. Recently, though, bitcoin has been catching fire around the world, with exchanges in China particularly active. A growing number of prominent American investors have also bought stakes, including Michael Novogratz, a principal at the private equity and hedge fund giant Fortress Investment Group, as well as the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler. The increasingly widespread ownership of bitcoin has shifted attention away from the criminal enterprises that have used digital money, but it was a focus at the Senate hearing. Last month, the online marketplace Silk Road, where bitcoin was the primary form of payment, was shut down and its founder arrested after authorities accused it of being used to buy and sell drugs, weapons and pornography. The chairman of the Senate committee, Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said that a few days after the arrest, a similar site sprang up. It can be harder to track criminals who use bitcoin, law enforcement officials said at the hearing, because they operate across international borders and often do not use established financial institutions that report transactions. But Mythili Raman, an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, also said that because every bitcoin transaction was recorded on a public ledger, it was possible for investigators to trace the movement of money between accounts. “It is not in fact anonymous. It is not immune from investigation,” Ms. Raman said. All the officials at the hearing said that crime had been an issue during the early days of credit cards and online payment systems like PayPal, and should not be a reason to limit innovation. “It is our duty as law enforcement to stay vigilant while recognizing that there are many legitimate users of those services,” Ms. Raman said. The bitcoin supporters who testified at the hearing said bitcoin could bring major changes to the financial system by cutting out the middle men needed to move money around the world. “I am here to testify because I believe that global digital currency represents one of the most important technical and economic innovations of our time,” said Jeremy Allaire, the chief executive of Circle Internet Financial, which is seeking to promote more widespread use of the currency. Given bitcoin’s appeal to skeptics of government, many aficionados have been wary of involvement by Washington. But advocates at the hearing said that the increasing cooperation with regulators could lay the groundwork for further growth. “As this technology moves from early adopters into mainstream acceptance, it is critical in my view that federal and state governments establish policies surrounding digital currency,” Mr. Allaire said.",0.20126888888888886,0.07007939848217626
320,Researchers Work to Add More Anonymity to Bitcoin,https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/researchers-work-to-add-more-anonymity-to-bitcoin/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-11-19T00:24:41+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"In my column this week, Disruptions: A Digital Underworld Cloaked in Anonymity, I noted that the Deep Web, or Dark Internet, had mushroomed in recent years because of a growing belief that it was possible to remain anonymous online. Want some crack cocaine or a semi-automatic gun? No problem, you can get them on the Internet. All you need is Tor, an anonymous Web browser, to do your shopping, and some bitcoins, a private cybercurrency, to pay for your merchandise. Then off you go to a long list of sites that sell these illegal goods — including Silk Road, Black Market Reloaded or Sheep Marketplace. But are people buying and selling wares online really anonymous? Researchers I spoke with for my column said in some instances that was true. But like most online transactions, people might be leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that could eventually point  to their real identity. While the bitcoin network is a decentralized mechanism for creating and transferring electronic cash around the Web, it also stores those transactions in a public ledger, which is called the “blockchain” that keeps track of every payment history. While it’s not as easy as trackng credit card transactions in real life, some researchers believe that the information tied to a bitcoin can be traced, specifically by tracking the string of numbers and letters that make up a single bitcoin and then looking at its purchase history. Matthew D. Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said he had been working with a team of researchers to come up with a solution to this problem. The team has been developing a new system, called “Zerocoin,” which is a proposed extension for bitcoins that would be able to provide complete anonymity for this currency. “We start with a bitcoin and then append a bunch of extensions on top of it — like additional random numbers — and then we swap bitcoins out with a Zerocoin,” Mr. Green said in an interview. “By doing this, we can completely anonymize the currency.” Mr. Green said he was not working on this project to help people procure drugs and guns online, but rather because he believed in the promise of letting people communicate and perform transactions in an anonymous and completely democratic way — much like using cash. Other researchers I spoke with noted that this is the same reason the anonymous Web browser Tor, short for The Onion Router, exists. While Tor is used by people who buy drugs online, the software, which was originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, is intended to protect online government communications and allow people  living in countries with repressive governments to communicate safely.",0.09235882352941176,0.039051014345131994

Then, without warning, GBL’s roughly 500 remaining investors were kicked out of the company’s official QQ group, a social media platform that the company was using for investor relations. By nightfall, the scale of the swindle was made public – 25 million renminbi, or $4.1 million  – making it one of the largest bitcoin fraud cases since the currency’s inception four years ago. “We want to find the culprits and make then return our hard-earned, sweat-stained money!” read one post by a victim on Sina Weibo, China’s most popular Twitter-like microblog. “Help us find the criminals!” In hindsight, there were numerous red flags that should have alerted GBL’s bamboozled investors. On May 27, just days after GBL was founded, a popular Chinese bitcoin forum pointed out that the company claimed to be based in Hong Kong, but  in fact was using servers located in Beijing. In addition, GBL lacked an official company email address and did not have a license to provide financial services.

The willingness to invest in GBL despite its shortcomings demonstrates just how popular “crypto-currency” has become in China. In early November, BTC China overtook Mt. Gox and Bistamp to become the largest bitcoin exchange site in the world, handling 34 percent of global bitcoin transactions over the previous seven days, according to data from Bitcoinity.org, a website that tracks bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin’s appeal to Chinese investors is manifold. The currency experienced a major spike in value in July shortly after being the subject of overwhelmingly favorable reports on CCTV, China’s state-run television station, and People’s Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper. The currency received a further boost in October when the Chinese search engine Baidu, which commands more than 80 percent of the Chinese search market, announced a plan to accept bitcoins as payment for its online security and firewall services. Last week, a real estate developer in Shanghai declared that it would accept bitcoins as payment for housing units in the city’s Pudong district. The company, Shanda Tiandi, posts bitcoin exchange values daily outside its office. This raises the possibility that China’s high-net-worth investors could try to use bitcoins to circumvent strict investment caps on the property market.  Analysts say that there is a deeper and more contentious reason for China’s bitcoin boom. The popularity of the digital currency has been linked to the fact that China’s citizens are unable to trade the renminbi as freely as people in other countries trade their own currencies. Beijing keeps a close grip on the renminbi, concerned about potential disruptions to the economy that could result from sudden outflows or inflows of funds. Should the government decide to crack down on the bitcoin, which some experts say is possible in the aftermath of such a major fraud case, it has the legal grounds to do so. In 2009, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Culture issued a rule prohibiting the exchange of virtual currency for renminbi, as well as the purchase of real-world goods and services with virtual currency. According to sources within the tech industry, the 2009 rule was aimed mainly at companies like Tencent Holdings – the parent company of the above-mentioned QQ platform – that allow online game players to use virtual currency to purchase virtual items. But the backbone of the rule is clear: Virtual currencies must stay out of the real economy.",0.05049999999999999,0.0838750862663906

Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state’s superintendent of financial services, announced on Thursday that he would conduct a public hearing to discuss the expanding world of digital money. Participants will discuss the feasibility of a license that would make the virtual currency market more like those for other forms of money. If the plans go ahead, it would be an important step in bringing bitcoin and other virtual currencies closer to the financial mainstream. In another move in the same direction, the Federal Election Commission held a hearing on Thursday at which it considered whether to legalize campaign donations made in virtual currencies. Since bitcoin was created in 2009 by anonymous programmers, it has been treated with derision by many financial insiders and authorities, who have described it as a speculative mania. Many authorities still hold to that position, but the currency’s online network, which is not controlled by any centralized authority, has survived several crises. On Thursday, the value of a single bitcoin was trading near a record high, at $425, on the exchange Mt. Gox. The price has skyrocketed in recent weeks. Several regulators have been looking at ways to make sure virtual money cannot be used for laundering money or other criminal purposes. In October, the federal authorities arrested the operator of an online marketplace where they said bitcoin could be used to buy drugs and other illegal goods. “The cloak of anonymity provided by virtual currencies has helped support dangerous criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, money laundering, gunrunning and child pornography,” Mr. Lawsky said in a letter announcing the hearing, which has not yet been scheduled.",0.025300000000000003,0.02512885551948052

But some entrepreneurs, investors and even merchants are eyeing a far more mainstream use for it. They are convinced that bitcoin, though not widely understood, offers a path to lower payment processing and more secure transactions. Instead of using bitcoin to buy illegal guns in the recesses of the web, they say, ordinary consumers will use it to buy legal goods from legal retailers — and as easily as they now swipe their credit cards or exchange paper bills. “I’m confident you will see major worldwide retailers adopting systems built on bitcoin,” said Jim Breyer, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early Facebook investor who also served on the board of Walmart Stores for more than a decade. Mr. Breyer is an investor in Circle Internet Financial, one of the host of start-ups trying to find a way to make bitcoin a widely adopted currency for retail payments. The company was started by Jeremy Allaire, a serial entrepreneur, and it aims to be a payment processing system for online and physical merchants, similar to the service PayPal offers online. Along with his venture firm, Accel Partners, and another called General Catalyst Partners, Mr. Breyer has invested $9 million in the company. One potential obstacle to mainstream acceptance of bitcoin is the sometimes wild fluctuations in its value, which makes it alluring to currency speculators but could scare off ordinary consumers. One bitcoin was worth just over $200 Wednesday afternoon. Someone who bought a bitcoin in early April paid as much as $266 for it. Only a small and motley assortment of merchants now accept bitcoin as payment, and in many cases they do it largely as a marketing strategy. The list includes a winery in British Columbia, the popular online dating site OkCupid and a Seattle lunch truck that specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches. A start-up called Gyft lets people buy electronic gift cards for major retailers with bitcoin, and this week an A.T.M. in Vancouver, Canada, began issuing bitcoin to people in exchange for cash. “We pride ourselves on being the nerdiest online dating site,” said Sam Yagan, co-founder of OkCupid, which is owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp, a media and Internet company. “We were like, ‘This is cool and we should do it.’ ” Since bitcoin emerged in 2009, many of those who flocked to the currency celebrated it for being beyond the clutches of governments and other institutions. Until recently, the currency lubricated transactions on Silk Road, one of the Web’s biggest bazaars for drugs, forged documents and other contraband. The site was shut down in early October by federal authorities. New bitcoin is created on computers connected through a peer-to-peer network. An algorithm controls the production of new bitcoin, which is meant to mitigate the risk of inflation. Already, though, businesses transferring and exchanging bitcoin find themselves in regulators’ cross hairs. In March, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, issued guidelines telling businesses involved in the exchange of digital currencies that they needed to register as money services businesses and comply with a variety of rules to prevent money laundering. New York’s Department of Financial services began an inquiry in August to determine guidelines for digital currency businesses, issuing nearly two dozen subpoenas to start-ups, investors and others involved in the emerging field. Patrick M. Byrne, chief executive of the online retailer Overstock.com, said his company was talking about accepting bitcoin, but it decided to pause its plans until legal matters around the currency were clarified. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a start-up that helps merchants accept bitcoin and helps consumers obtain it by exchanging traditional currencies, said he thought the demise of Silk Road gave entrepreneurs and investors more confidence in bitcoin. “The bad guys basically lost,” said Mr. Ehrsam, whose start-up has raised over $6 million from Union Square Ventures and others. “It took the single most illegitimate player in the space and wiped them off the map.” Bitcoin advocates, and especially merchants, say one of the currency’s most enticing promises is that it could significantly lower payment processing costs. Retailers typically pay 2 to 3 percent of the value of a customer sale when a credit card is used. Retailers have long complained about these fees and have sought other options, but without much luck. PayPal, the online payment system, typically charges merchants a fee between 2.2 percent and 2.9 percent, as well as a per-transaction fee of 30 cents. “There have been a number of alternative currencies talked about over time,” said Chris Monteiro, a spokesman for MasterCard. “The bottom line is consumers want a payment solution that is safe, simple to use and universally accepted.” Fees for a merchant accepting bitcoin payments often range from nothing to less than 2 percent because of the open nature of the technology. Coinbase, for example, said it did not charge its merchants for the first $1 million in sales, imposing a 1 percent fee after that on the conversion of bitcoin into local currency. Circle said it had not settled on pricing for merchants, but that it would charge them a fee to use its system that would be well below credit card transaction costs. Mr. Allaire and others predict that merchants will encourage customers to spend bitcoin by passing some of the savings on to them in the form of lower prices or other rewards. “Bitcoin definitely addresses a need,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. “The payments industry is ready to be disrupted.” The fluctuating value of bitcoin has not stopped some investors. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers who tangled with Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook, have said they are big holders of bitcoin and have filed a proposal with securities regulators that would let investors trade bitcoin as if it were stocks. Other challenges face Circle and other start-ups building new payment systems. For example, it can take several business days to link someone’s bank account to their bitcoin. Mr. Allaire of Circle said one of his goals was to make that initial setup much faster. Mr. Allaire also said his company, which is based in Boston, will protect its customers’ bitcoin by creating “offline reserves” — batches of the digital currency on physical storage devices, like a hard drive, not connected to the Internet. The offline bitcoin reserves will be protected by armed guards, he said. George Peabody, senior director at Glenbrook Partners, a consultancy in the payments industry, said Circle was a sign of the maturation of entrepreneurs entering the bitcoin market.  Mr. Allaire was an early web entrepreneur, founding a web application development company, Allaire Corporation, that went public in 1999 and was sold to Macromedia. An Internet video company he created, Brightcove, went public last year. Mr. Allaire said he was convinced that bitcoin represented another major technological development. “It’s similar to me in import as the web browser,” he said. “It’s as exciting and significant as that.”",0.18696666666666667,0.044010597041847045

The National Crime Agency of Britain said it took four men into custody last week, hours after the arrest in San Francisco of Ross Ulbricht, who American authorities say was the owner of Silk Road. Mr. Ulbricht, 29, was charged last week with conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and other charges.  The arrests represent the first major initiative by the N.C.A., a newly formed national police agency that the British government hopes will serve as the equivalent of the F.B.I. in the United States. N.C.A. officials say they are planning a wider campaign to fight crime in the dark corners of the Internet. “These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden Internet isn’t hidden and your anonymous activity isn’t anonymous,” said Keith Bristow, the N.C.A.’s director general. “We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.” The four men were taken into custody after N.C.A. officers, working closely with American law enforcement, identified several people they believed to be “significant users” of Silk Road, the British police said. Their identities of the men were not released on Tuesday. In documents last week, American prosecutors in New York said Silk Road was used to sell a variety of illegal drugs, including ecstasy, marijuana and heroin. Users also anonymously offered computer hacking services, forged documents and pirated movies, authorities in the United States said.  The only form of payment accepted on the Web site was bitcoins, a virtual currency. American officials seized about 26,000 bitcoins valued at about $3.6 million last week and shut down the online marketplace.

It began in 2011 as an underground online marketplace for drug users, a site where endless varieties of marijuana — as well as LSD, ecstasy and prescription pills — could be bought from sellers across the world. It branched out to other illicit goods, including forged documents, and emerged as a black market version of eBay, where criminals could do business with more than 100,000 customers. It worked on one basic principle: Everyone remained anonymous. Users could gain access to the network only through software meant to ensure anonymity. Credit cards and PayPal were not accepted. Bitcoins, a virtual currency, were, and even those transactions were scrambled. All that connected them in real life was a name, often fake, and the address to which the package would be sent. And the mastermind behind Silk Road was cloaked in mystery, known as Dread Pirate Roberts, after a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.” But Silk Road went dark this week, and its owner was unmasked as Ross Ulbricht, 29, who is accused in a criminal complaint, among other things, of asking a man to kill a Silk Road vendor who had threatened to reveal the identities of others who used the site. In another case, Mr. Ulbricht is accused of asking an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to kill a former Silk Road employee whom Mr. Ulbricht feared would become a government witness, according to an indictment. F.B.I. agents confronted Mr. Ulbricht in a library in San Francisco on Tuesday and arrested him on narcotics and money-laundering charges. The case, which is being coordinated by federal prosecutors in New York, is part of a larger push by federal authorities to police illicit commerce along the frontier of the Internet. A few high-profile cases have involved defendants overseas, which made it all the more noteworthy that the man accused of being behind Silk Road was in the United States and remained undetected for so long. He had been living with his parents in Austin, Tex., until last fall, when he moved to San Francisco to tap into its entrepreneurial spirit. “I feel like the world is in flux,” Mr. Ulbricht said, in a lengthy discussion with a childhood friend, Rene Pinnell, that appeared on YouTube last year. “I want to see where all this new technology goes.” His goals included starting a family, making more friends and having “a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity,” according to the video, which makes no mention of Silk Road. In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Pinnell said that “Ross is the most principled, honest person I’ve ever had the pleasure to know.” Referring to the government’s charges, Mr. Pinnell said Mr. Ulbricht “would never do anything like that.” Mr. Ulbricht carved out an anonymous life in San Francisco. He rented a room and told his two housemates that his name was Josh, the authorities said. One roommate reported that “Josh” was always home in his room on the computer. There, according to the federal complaint, he made a lot of money. The F.B.I. was able to obtain an image of the Silk Road’s Web server, which indicated the site had sales revenue of more than 9.5 million bitcoins, valued at about $1.2 billion today, though the total worth was most likely less at the time of the sales, according to the complaint. Bitcoins also have had a strong following among young, technologically proficient libertarians who are attracted to a currency that is not connected to any government. According to technology experts, Silk Road was responsible for something approaching half of all transactions involving bitcoins. Investigators believe Mr. Ulbricht collected commissions of more than 600,000 bitcoins, the equivalent of $80 million, which they are trying to gain access to. So far, the authorities have seized 26,000 bitcoins, worth about $3.6 million, from escrow accounts into which Silk Road buyers placed funds. In an interview in Forbes magazine in September, Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonym authorities say Mr. Ulbricht adopted, spoke of Silk Road as a so-called disrupter of social norms. “We’re talking about the potential for a monumental shift in the power structure of the world,” Roberts said. “The people now can control the flow and distribution of information and the flow of money. Sector by sector, the state is being cut out of the equation.” It appears Mr. Ulbricht forgot at times to cover his digital footsteps: investigators discovered that his personal e-mail account was linked to some early efforts to promote Silk Road. The court papers filed in the case make clear that federal authorities have been after Silk Road for some time. Undercover agents have made more than 100 drug purchases from Silk Road vendors, whose packages arrived in New York bearing the postal markings of 10 countries. Steven Kalar, the federal public defender in San Francisco, said his office represented Mr. Ulbricht in his preliminary appearances in Federal District Court on Wednesday. Mr. Kalar declined to comment further. But even as the federal agents were trying to build a case against Silk Road, it was threatened from within. Earlier this year, a Silk Road vendor who went by the handle FriendlyChemist began telling Mr. Ulbricht “that he had a long list of real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers that he had obtained from hacking into the computer of another, larger Silk Road vendor,” according to the complaint. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the information unless he received $500,000, according to the complaint. Mr. Ulbricht began messaging with one of FriendlyChemist’s purported creditors. In one message, detailed in the complaint, Mr. Ulbricht wrote, “FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn’t mind if he was executed.” He passed along what he knew about FriendlyChemist: a name and that he lived in White Rock, British Columbia. He paid $150,000 worth of bitcoins to the creditor, who was known to Mr. Ulbricht by the handle redandwhite, to carry out the murder, according to the complaint. But what happened next remains unclear, according to court papers filed in the case. Mr. Ulbricht received “a picture of the victim after the job was done.” But Agent Christopher Tarbell, who swore out the criminal complaint, said the Canadian authorities had no record of a homicide occurring near White Rock around that time.

Now that those companies are going public, SecondMarket is turning its attention to the next new thing — bitcoin. On Thursday, SecondMarket is expected to begin raising money for an investment fund — the first of its kind in the United States — that will hold only bitcoins, giving wealthy investors exposure to the trendy but controversial virtual currency. The fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, aims to provide a reliable and easy way to bet on the future price of bitcoin, a currency generally traded on unregulated, online exchanges based overseas.  “If you speak with people who have tried to purchase bitcoin in the past — you’ll hear, ‘it’s a difficult process,’ ‘it’s a confusing process,’ ‘it’s a scary process,’ ” said Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, based in New York. “We want to make it an accessible asset class.” SecondMarket’s venture into bitcoin represents the latest effort to bring the virtual currency into the mainstream. But it is also likely to fuel the debate around the legitimacy and legality of a form of money that exists outside the conventional banking system, and has already attracted scrutiny for being used in illicit transactions. Created in 2009 by a still unknown individual, or group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoins exist only in digital form and can be bought with traditional money through the Internet. New bitcoins are “mined” by programmers solving complex math problems. The original programmers determined that only a finite number of bitcoins would be created. While bitcoin is accepted as a form of payment by a growing, but still small number of businesses, it is mostly the domain of speculators, some of whom are drawn to its potential as an alternative to national currencies. The fortunes of bitcoin have in some ways paralleled the postfinancial crisis interest in gold, another asset that has appealed to investors skeptical of the monetary policy of the major central banks. “It’s still at a point where the value is set by what the next guy is willing to pay for it,” said Brian Riley, senior research director at the CEB TowerGroup. “Even though it’s got the cool factor to it, it’s still not a place to park your 401(k).”  Bitcoins gained much wider public exposure this year, when the price doubled and then collapsed over a few weeks. Recently, the price of a single bitcoin has stabilized, trading at $135, down from its peak of more than $250 in April. The total value of all outstanding bitcoins is currently over $1.5 billion. The SecondMarket fund’s creation comes just a few months after Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the technology investors best known for their involvement with Facebook, announced the creation of a similar product. The Winklevosses’ vehicle, though, will be an exchange traded fund, or E.T.F., accessible to all investors. As a result it must go through a lengthy and uncertain review process with federal regulators. In contrast, the SecondMarket fund can begin raising money immediately because it will be available only to investors who meet a wealth threshold set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those who qualify, called “accredited investors,” must have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or annual income of more than $200,000 in each of the previous two years. Mr. Silbert said that because of the risky nature of bitcoins, they should not be sold to ordinary retail investors who could buy E.T.F.’s. “It’s premature for this kind of product to be in the public market,” Mr. Silbert said. “It should not be available to unsophisticated investors.” Mr. Silbert, who started SecondMarket in 2004, has built a business making markets in risky, inaccessible investments. The company operates an exchange on which employees of private companies can sell their shares to wealthy investors, essentially a private-company stock market. This kind of trading exploded in recent years because of the boom in social networking Web sites, driving up the valuations of start-ups like Facebook, Twitter, Groupon and Zynga. Now that all these companies have either gone public or announced their intention to do so, there are questions about how SecondMarket and its ilk will adapt. Its biggest competitor, SharesPost, announced a partnership with Nasdaq to raise the visibility of its private exchange. For SecondMarket, the bitcoin fund signals a push to diversify into new businesses. Beyond its exchange for private company shares, it has facilitated the buying and selling of other hard-to-trade assets like bankruptcy claims and auction rate securities. Another recently created division helps start-ups raise capital. The company has already amassed a $2.25 million stake of bitcoins that will seed the new fund. SecondMarket has spent the last year developing relationships with over a hundred bitcoin players, including programmers, merchants and exchanges. Those relationships should make it easier for the company to quickly find the best price for bitcoin at a given time. SecondMarket says the fund will make it possible for investors to have access to the bitcoin market without dealing with the sometimes unreliable online exchanges and the complex security issues involved in storing digital money. Packaging bitcoins as a fund may also allow the investment to be kept in tax-advantaged retirement account, Mr. Silbert said. SecondMarket’s new fund is following in the steps of Exante, a hedge fund operator in Malta. That firm said that its Bitcoin Hedge Fund has amassed 90,000 bitcoins, which would be worth about $12.2 million. Mr. Silbert, 37, has already been involved in the bitcoin world, parlaying his early purchases of the digital money into a broader array of investments in bitcoin-related companies including Coinbase, a bitcoin storage company, and Bitpay, a payment processor. One of the risks for bitcoin investors is the uncertain regulatory environment. A Senate committee and a number of state regulators have been examining whether the currency is evading financial oversight, allowing it to be used by money launderers, tax dodgers and drug traffickers. The world’s largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, based in Japan, has had numerous run-ins with American authorities, leading to periodic closings of the service for American customers. On at least one front, though, SecondMarket is taking advantage of relaxed regulations that went into effect just this week letting financial firms publicly market their private funds. But that does not mean that investment experts think the bitcoin fund will be a smart purchase for most investors, even well-heeled ones. “Just because the S.E.C. now allows a private fund to advertise an offering doesn’t mean it’s a prudent investment,” said Jay G. Baris, a lawyer who leads the investment management practice at Morrison & Foerster. “And investing in bitcoin does not have the same risk profile as investing in a blue chip stock.”",0.17023518518518518,0.0740342579231468

Group of 20 meetings in the spring about blockchain regulation did not yield much except a recognition that crypto assets are not merely currencies and a July deadline for the organization’s first step toward regulation. The International Monetary Fund recently highlighted the utility of crypto assets, while also cautioning that, depending on how large they grow, they could someday pose risks to financial stability. Some jurisdictions are further ahead than others, though the tacks they are taking vary widely. John Collins, an affiliate with the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University and former head of policy for Coinbase, said one of the strictest, and most opaque, is China, which has banned crypto exchanges and so-called initial coin offerings. More welcoming are Switzerland, Singapore and Britain. Switzerland is home to the “Crypto Valley” near Zug, where a number of crypto start-ups — including Xapo and Shapeshift and teams behind initial coin offerings, such as Ethereum and Tezos — are based. Regulators there have deemed that storing a customer’s crypto assets does not qualify as taking deposits, so such companies do not require banking licenses, freeing start-ups from the requirements to obtain one. Additionally, the Swiss financial market regulator Finma released principles-based guidelines that would be applied case by case as opposed to prescriptive rules. It also designated a category called utility token, which are not considered securities. Some Chinese companies are moving to Switzerland, which is a hot spot for I.C.O.s; Geneva has even created a guide for token issuers. “Switzerland is already developing into a leading hub, and I think that will be even more the case in the future,” Olga Feldmeier, chief executive of Zug-based SmartValor, said. Britain and Singapore have also been lauded by crypto start-ups for their regulatory environment, which enables companies to experiment under relaxed regulation and licensing requirements. But these progressive approaches are not the norm. “There has been a hesitancy on the part of these regulators to regulate because they don’t want to grant these businesses a seal of approval,” Mr. Collins said. “The fear on the part of the industry at this point shouldn’t be that there’s a crackdown, but that they’ll be ignored because no one is going to take them seriously. And if no one takes them seriously, and they still can’t get bank accounts, that’s a problem.”",0.04518888888888889,0.04001322751322752

Only a limited number of bitcoins can be created. And an online community has bid up the price of individual bitcoins, which are stored digitally on a decentralized network of computers. On Tuesday, a bitcoin was being sold for about $108 online. Lawmakers are worried that bitcoin and other alternative forms of money can be used to evade taxes, defraud investors and assist trade in illegal products like drugs and pornography. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused a Texas man of profiting from a bitcoin Ponzi scheme on the same day it issued a broader warning about the dangers of similar frauds. Earlier this year, the operators of another virtual currency, Liberty Reserve, were accused of running a $6 billion money-laundering ring. The Senate committee began looking into virtual currency a few months ago, formally interviewing several regulators and industry participants. The committee recently stepped up its efforts because staff members had heard “real concern” from law enforcement officials, and because it became clear that regulators did not have enough information about the technology, according to the person involved in the investigation. “The federal government must make sure that potential threats and risks are dealt with swiftly,” the Senate letter said. Both the Senate committee and Mr. Lawsky have emphasized that the technology could have good uses, and any new regulations would help protect those. But Mr. Lawsky, in a formal notice released on Monday, said, “If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country’s national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise.” Mr. Lawsky’s office sent subpoenas to most of the companies that have publicly discussed investing in bitcoin or creating software that would allow for the transfer and exchange of bitcoins. “It is in the common interest of both the public and the virtual currency industry to bring virtual currencies out of the darkness and into the light of day through enhanced transparency,” Mr. Lawsky’s notice said.",0.08294800000000001,0.04827741702741703

A type of digital cash, bitcoins were invented in 2009 and can be sent directly to anyone, anywhere in the world. You don’t have to go through a financial institution, which means no fees and no one tracking your spending habits. With a current market capitalization of $1 billion, bitcoins are beginning to be more widely accepted. You can use them to pay for a pizza or make speculative bets that could end up financing your child’s college education. But bitcoins, and other digital currencies, have also come under scrutiny. Liberty Reserve, an online payment system, was shuttered in the spring by New York authorities, who said the company used its digital currency, known as LRs, to launder up to $6 billion. And law enforcement officials have voiced concerns that bitcoins could also abet illegal transactions. Bart Chilton, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggested that bitcoins might be ripe for regulation. Moreover, some critics say the bitcoin infrastructure is insecure, as hackable as any other computer-based system. “The way the basic bitcoin system works is both incredibly solid and incredibly clever from a technical standpoint,” said Nicholas Weaver, senior staff researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, which studies and advances a range of emerging technologies. “The system’s security is fragile, however, and the economic model behind bitcoin is, well, crazy stupid.” Nonetheless, paying with bitcoins can be a weirdly fun way to make transactions. Here is a primer on how to do it. Like gold, bitcoins, which are both a currency and a commodity, are in limited supply (there is a cap of 21 million total) and have to be “mined” before they are put in circulation. Anyone can mine for bitcoins by downloading software, known as the bitcoin client, which algorithmically crunches a bunch of numbers to legitimize or authenticate a sequence or “block” of past bitcoin transactions. So bitcoins are basically minted as a reward for contributing to the smooth operation of the system. Validating a block yields 25 bitcoins, which are currently worth $2,675. The fluctuating price of bitcoins, also like gold, is a function of supply and demand, as well as psychology. “Bitcoins have value because people say they have value,” said Andrew White, a former I.T. manager for the Wikimedia Foundation and now a digital currency entrepreneur in San Francisco. Unlike fiat currencies like the United States dollar and virtual currencies like Facebook credits and the one invented by Liberty Reserve, bitcoins are not created or controlled by a central authority. But with the blistering rate of bitcoin transactions these days, you need a pricey and complex computer rig to effectively run the bitcoin client and procure some bitcoin bounty. An easier way to get bitcoins is to just find someone willing to sell them to you. Julian Tosh, an I.T. systems administrator in Las Vegas, for example, lets friends and family buy items on his Amazon wish list and pays them back in bitcoins. “This works well as long as I need stuff,” said Mr. Tosh, who also presides over a Wednesday “Bitcoin Lunch Mob” in Las Vegas, which gathers to discuss and trade bitcoins. But maybe you don’t personally know any bitcoin enthusiasts like Mr. Tosh or the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who own around $11 million worth and have filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission to form a bitcoin investment trust. If so, you might try localbitcoins.com, which lists people in your area who are willing to exchange bitcoins for cold hard cash. The market price Tuesday afternoon was $107 for a bitcoin. Be sure to check out sellers’ profiles and reviews to make sure they are reputable. And, of course, it’s always a good idea to meet in a public place to make the transaction. Bitcoins can be easily transferred and stored using a digital wallet app on your Android mobile device. Popular wallet apps include BitcoinSpinner and Bitcoin Wallet. There are no iOS bitcoin wallet apps and Apple did not respond to e-mails seeking an explanation. But Blockchain has an online wallet service that you can access using any Internet-connected desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone. You can also get bitcoins through Mt.Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange and where the currency is traded as a commodity. But it’s a cumbersome and lengthy process, requiring wire transfers and scanning identity documents. The company, which is based in Japan, also charges a 0.6 percent fee for all transactions. Keep in mind that the United States Department of Homeland Security in May seized Mt.Gox’s United States accounts, saying it misrepresented the full extent of its financial operations. The company did not respond to requests for comment but continues to function as before the seizure. Another option is Coinbase, a bitcoin transaction platform, which recently announced a $5 million infusion of venture capital. While it’s still a nascent venture (not even a year old), the service hasn’t had any major hiccups yet and is relatively simple to use. You just enter your bank account and routing number, how many bitcoins you want and click “buy.” You can also send bitcoins to others through your Coinbase account. Just know you’ll be charged a 1 percent transaction fee. Once you have your bitcoins, the fun part is spending them. Bitcoin. travel, BitcoinsInVegas.com, Spendbitcoins.com and Reddit have directories of businesses that accept bitcoins as payment. And Bitpremier.com lists high-priced luxury items (cars, jets, yachts, etc.) you can buy with bitcoins. To make a purchase, all you have to do is type the receiver’s key code or scan their QR code into your bitcoin wallet and you’re done. Like cash transactions, you can’t cancel payment later, so be sure it’s what you want before you click “send.” Brewster Kahle, a founder of the Internet Archive in San Francisco, said he routinely used bitcoins to pay for lunch at a local sushi restaurant. He’s interested in the technology and appreciates the libertarian aspect of it. “Bitcoin used to be just in the land of computer geeks, but not anymore,” he said. More businesses are accepting bitcoins lately thanks to Bitpay, which supplies software for processing bitcoin payments. The merchant pays a 0.99 percent fee per transaction versus the 2 to 4 percent fees charged by credit card companies. Bitpay will also immediately convert bitcoins to dollars if the merchant desires. “Bitcoin users are pretty enthusiastic, so you get instant loyal customers,” said Adam Penn, owner of Veggie Galaxy, a restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., which began accepting bitcoins through Bitpay in May. “So far, it’s been a no-risk revenue generator.” Also last month, Bitpay announced a partnership with the mobile gift card app Gyft, which will allow people to use bitcoins to purchase gift cards from hundreds of retailers including Brookstone, Lowe’s, Gap, Sephora, GameStop, American Eagle, Nike, Marriott, Burger King and Fandango. “It’s a huge development,” said Mr. Tosh in Las Vegas, who predicts Gyft’s embrace of bitcoins will lead to widespread use of the alternative currency. “Pandora’s box has been smashed.” Or maybe not. The legal trouble at Mt.Gox sent a shiver through the market as did S.E.C. charges last week that the founder and operator of the lesser-known Bitcoin Savings and Trust in McKinney, Tex., was running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme. Still, bitcoin advocates point out that, despite some bad actors, the actual system has not had a major security breach. Nevertheless, even the most ardent bitcoin boosters urge caution. Bitcoins have appreciated more than 700 percent  since this time last year — an increase some have compared to a bubble bound to burst. “It’s supervolatile, so I’d tell people to go slow,” said Peter Vessenes, chairman and executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes the currency. “Never hold more bitcoins than you’re prepared to lose.”",0.2208275362318841,0.07907360353012527

Now, two backers of the digital money are seeking to bring bitcoin into the investing mainstream — if they win the approval of the United States government. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins best known for their part in the history of Facebook, filed a proposal with securities regulators on Monday that would allow any investor to trade bitcoins, just as if they were stocks. The plan involves an exchange-traded fund, which usually tracks a basket of stocks or a commodity, but in this case would hold only bitcoins.

Recently the world’s largest trading exchange for bitcoins, Mt.Gox, filed with the Treasury Department to register itself as a money services business and comply with money-laundering laws. The proposal from the twins, who already have sizable bitcoin holdings, is an audacious one: the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust could send digital money from the realm of computer programmers, Internet entrepreneurs and a small circle of professional investors like themselves into the hands of retail investors — virtually anyone with a brokerage account. “The trust brings bitcoin to Main Street and mainstream investors to bitcoin,” said Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Math-Based Asset Services, which would operate the proposed fund. “It eliminates the friction of buying and reduces the risks associated with storing bitcoin while offering similar investment attributes to direct ownership.” Their proposal has the advantage of coming from the desk of Kathleen Moriarty, a lawyer at Katten Muchin, who played a leading role in the creation of the first exchange-traded fund and popular gold- and silver-backed E.T.F.’s. But it is far from certain that securities regulators will approve. Even if they do, such a fund would face major challenges, including the current bottlenecks that stop bitcoins from being easily bought and sold. “There are so many ways it could go wrong,” said Ugo Egbunike, a senior specialist in exchange-traded funds at the data company Index Universe. On Monday, several market participants suggested that the proposal was a long shot that was merely an attempt to legitimize the digital currency. But Cameron Winklevoss expressed confidence that regulators would bless the new investment. “We have assembled a team that has successfully launched novel products before, and we firmly believe in the chances of success for this product,” he said. The filing is the latest eye-catching development in bitcoin’s history since it was founded by an anonymous hacker, or hackers, in 2009. Unlike traditional money, bitcoins exist in no physical form and are not backed by a central bank. Instead, the coins are created by a network of users who solve complex mathematical problems — a method known as “mining” — to generate bitcoins. Only a finite number of bitcoins can be created — 21 million — with the current count at about 11 million. A limited number of stores and Web sites are accepting bitcoin as payment, but for now it is primarily a vehicle for speculators. “The value of bitcoins is determined by the value that various market participants place on bitcoins through their transactions,” the brothers’ filing says. The currency grabbed the attention of global markets in April when the value of a single bitcoin spiked to more than $250 from $110, before plummeting. While there were questions about the survival of the currency, the value of a bitcoin has recently hovered around $100, making the total market worth about $1 billion. During the April swoon, the Winklevosses went public with their own bitcoin hoard, amounting to about 1 percent of all outstanding coins, or about $10 million. Bitcoins can currently only be bought and sold on informal computer networks and on online marketplaces that require substantial technological savvy and are far more complicated than traditional exchanges. The inaccessibility, and the limited quantity of bitcoins, appeal to users who are skeptical of governments and central banks. But it has made the system vulnerable at times to hackers and technology flaws. An exchange-traded fund would make it significantly easier to gain exposure to bitcoins, just as commodities-based funds have made investing in gold, silver and other precious metals more accessible. The Winklevoss fund would buy one bitcoin for every five shares, making the value of a single share worth about a fifth of a single bitcoin. Regulated trading desks would have to handle the daily buying and selling of the shares. The company operated by the Winklevosses would have a proprietary method for storing the fund’s bitcoin holdings and would charge an annual management fee, which is not specified in the filing. Monday’s submission comes at a precarious time for digital money. In May, the operators of another online currency, Liberty Reserve, were indicted on charges that they facilitated billions of dollars of money laundering. Both before and after that, state and federal regulators were scrutinizing many players in the growing bitcoin economy, including the largest place to buy and sell the coins, the Tokyo-based Mt.Gox. Before Mt.Gox registered with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, some of its accounts in the United States were frozen. The company temporarily stopped its American customers from cashing out while it said it was “making improvements.” Mt.Gox’s difficulties highlight the risks that could confront the owner of shares in a bitcoin fund. The securities filing made Monday has 18 pages of “risk factors,” noting, among other concerns, the heavy presence of speculators and “an uncertain regulatory landscape.” Mr. Egbunike said regulators may hesitate to approve the proposal because of the questions surrounding bitcoins and recent scrutiny of exchange-traded funds more broadly. While such funds have made the buying and selling of commodities and other complicated financial assets easier for retail investors, they have given these investors access to products that they may not understand. For current bitcoin aficionados, an E.T.F. could diminish the currency’s free-spirited appeal. But even if the Winklevosses’ proposal fails, some industry experts said that it marks a significant signpost in the push to give virtual currencies at least a veneer of respectability. “Digital currencies are not going away,” said Carol Van Cleef, the head of law firm Patton Boggs’s emerging-payments practice. “And as bitcoin rises in popularity, you’re going to see traditional financial products and services being adapted to it.”",0.2808772727272727,0.06875596467926014

And so began a collaboration between his organization, major banks, credit card companies, Internet service providers, payment processors, and Internet companies like Google and Microsoft. They had hoped to follow the money and quash child pornography for good. But at some point the money trail went cold. For the last year, Mr. Allen has been working with global law enforcement and financial leaders to find out why. He may be getting closer to an answer. Today, cybersecurity experts say billions of dollars made from child pornography and illicit sales of things like national secrets and drugs are being moved through anonymous Internet payment systems like Liberty Reserve, the currency exchange whose operators were indicted Tuesday for laundering $6 billion. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, described it as the largest online money-laundering case in history. “What we have concluded is that illegal enterprises — commercial child pornography, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and organized crime — has largely moved to an unregulated system that is not connected to any central bank or national authority,” Mr. Allen said. “The key to all of this has been anonymity.” Liberty Reserve was shut down last weekend, but cybersecurity experts said it was just one among hundreds of anonymous Internet payment systems. They said online systems like the Moscow-based WebMoney, Perfect Money, based in Panama, and CashU, which serves the Middle East and North Africa, require little more than a valid e-mail address to initiate an account. The names and locations of the actual users are unknown and can be easily fabricated. And they worry that the no-questions-asked verification system has created a safe harbor for illicit activity. “There are a multitude of anonymous payment systems out there, similar to Liberty Reserve, of which there are over one hundred,” said Tom Kellermann, a vice president at the security company Trend Micro. “Many pretend to ‘know your customer’ but do not actually do due diligence.” Representatives for WebMoney, Perfect Money and CashU did not return e-mailed requests for comment. Currency exchanges like Liberty Reserve do not take or make payments of actual cash directly. Instead, they work with third parties that take payments and, in turn, credit the Liberty Reserve account. After the authorities went after Liberty Reserve, underground forums buzzed with comments from people mourning the potential loss of frozen funds and others offering alternatives, including Bitcoin, the peer-to-peer payment network started in 2009 to offer a decentralized way to create and transfer electronic cash around the world. In closed underground Russian-language forums, one person wrote, “I had almost 6k there. Where to now?” Another suggested, “Maybe another alternative is Perfect Money? I wonder if Bitcoin exchange rate will go up or not.” Indeed, the value of the Bitcoin virtual currency spiked temporarily on news of the Liberty Reserve shutdown. But law enforcement officials say Liberty Reserve operated with more anonymity than Bitcoin. Unlike Liberty Reserve and other anonymous payment systems, Bitcoin transactions are stored in a public ledger, called a block chain, that make it possible to trace Bitcoin transactions even years after the fact. “You can track specific Bitcoin movements just as you would the serial number on a U.S. dollar,” said Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer. The real concern, security experts say, are private payment services that claim to do due diligence, but do not do even the most basic verification. Typically, money transfers are subject to strict regulation, which include maintaining customer identification records, filing suspicious activity reports, mandatory reporting on large currency transfers, and “know-your-customer requirements.” But security experts say there are a multitude of anonymous payment systems that require no customer identification and have little capability to detect or report suspicious activities. “You would think they would be regulated but there is no regulation,” Mr. Kellermann said. Of online payment processors, PayPal is considered the gold standard. The company, now owned by eBay, has payment experts to ensure PayPal is compliant with “know-your-customer” regulations and with law enforcement agencies in each country in which it operates. “It’s unfortunate that as many of these new services come on board, it’s the people looking to abuse them who are the first to use them,” said Anuj Nayar, a spokesman at PayPal. “There’s a lot more than just having the right technology in place to be an efficient global payment processor.” In March, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, began applying anti-money laundering rules to virtual currencies, amid worries that new forms of cash purchased on the Web, like Bitcoin, were being used to finance illicit enterprises. While Bitcoin is just a software system, there are multiple gateways and exchange points that allow Bitcoin owners to exchange their Bitcoins for cash. Federal authorities recently seized accounts associated with a United States intermediary of Mt. Gox, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, because it was not FinCen compliant. That, and other exchanges in the United States are now racing to be fully compliant with “know-your-customer laws” and anti-money laundering requirements. Mr. Allen said he believed that was a good first step. “With anonymous payment systems, tracking has become virtually impossible,” he said. “How do you prevent these kinds of problems when you are dealing with an unregulated currency, monitored by nobody? The answer, I think, is there has to be some kind of structure.”",0.19318571428571427,0.07906646539087016
335,"Unlike Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin Is Not Anonymous — Yet",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous-but-it-could-be/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-05-29T04:07:02+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"12:34 p.m. | Updated This post was changed to properly reflect the change in Bitcoin’s value. After Liberty Reserve, an online payment system, was shut down by law enforcement authorities Tuesday, many wondered whether Bitcoin, the digital currency, would be next. Just a couple of years ago, a large pepperoni pizza would have cost you 10,000 Bitcoins. Now, a single Bitcoin is worth roughly $129. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has been driven up largely by speculators who believe, like gold, it could be a haven from the fluctuations of other currencies. But in small part, that jump also has been driven by those who believe the digital currency provides anonymous cover for illicit transactions. Silk Road, a black market for illegal drugs, relies on Bitcoin. Assassins are also apparently big fans.  (On the far, other end of the spectrum, it turns out the Winklevoss twins are also believers). But contrary to conventional wisdom, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In fact, security experts say that if prosecutions like Liberty Reserve continue, the most likely targets are major payment systems like WebMoney and eForexGold, payment systems that security experts contend allow their users to move capital anywhere in the world without verifying their identities. “There are a multitude of anonymous payments systems out there, similar to Liberty Reserve, of which there are over 100,” said Tom Kellermann, a vice president of the security company Trend Micro. “Many pretend to ‘know thy customer’ but do not actually do due diligence.” Bitcoin operates with greater transparency than those systems. It may be fully decentralized and requires no central bank or government authority, but Bitcoin transactions are as public — if not more so — than any other payment network. Each transaction is recorded in a public ledger, called a “block chain,” to keep people from writing the digital equivalent of a bad check. That public block chain makes it possible to trace transactions, even years after they have transpired. In one case, researchers were able to trace the spending of 25,000 stolen Bitcoins in 2011. Laundry services like Bitlaundry and Bitcoinlaundry make transactions harder to trace. But it’s unclear how long those services can operate with impunity after the Liberty Reserve shutdown. It also requires a fair amount of blind trust to assume that such services won’t themselves track — or steal — a users’ Bitcoins. With some additional code, however, cryptographers believe Bitcoin could finally live up to its covert reputation. At an annual security and privacy symposium in San Francisco last week, a group of cryptographers from Johns Hopkins University debuted Zerocoin, a Bitcoin add-on that if widely adopted could make Bitcoin transactions impossible to trace. The cryptographers, Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green and Aviel D. Rubin, believe Zerocoin could eventually “break the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted parties.” The cryptography will make your head spin — a full technical explanation is available here — but Mr. Miers likened Zerocoin to an in-house laundry service. Essentially, the Zerocoin add-on allows users to leave their Bitcoins floating in a wash, for someone else to grab, so long as they can redeem the same amount of Bitcoin in the future. There are some significant caveats. For Zerocoin to work, it will eventually require full-scale adoption. “People have to have faith in the currency system to actually use it,” Mr. Miers said. Zerocoins also require more computing power, which can lead to glitches and lag times. A complete transaction takes about two seconds to verify, which can be unpalatable to impatient users. Another challenge, Mr. Miers said, is explaining the “heavyweight crypto” to users. “As complicated as Bitcoin is, you can explain the crypto even to nonexperts,” Mr. Green wrote in a blog post last month. “Unfortunately Zerocoin is a different animal. It will take time to convince people that these new techniques are safe.” But the biggest challenge, in light of Tuesday’s indictment of Liberty Reserve, could be government interference. Law enforcement officials have largely left Bitcoin alone. One exception was earlier this month when the federal authorities seized accounts associated with Mutum Sigillum, an intermediary of Mt. Gox, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange. But according to the warrant, the accounts were seized because Mutum Sigillum had not properly registered as a money transmitter with the Treasury Department. If Bitcoin became a truly anonymous payment system, security experts say it would spur far greater scrutiny if it hasn’t already.",0.10159999999999998,0.01998516414141414
336,A Push for a Bitcoin Buttonwood,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/a-push-for-a-bitcoin-buttonwood/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-05-06T23:24:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Amid the incense, cheap art and herbal remedies for sale in Union Square in Manhattan on Monday, a very different kind of product was changing hands: bitcoins. Just feet from the park’s statue of George Washington, a crowd of young men gathered on Monday afternoon to buy and sell the digital, crypto-currency. The men – and there were only men – were brought together by an online posting from Josh Rossi, 31, a bitcoin aficionado who works in technology at the World Trade Financial Group. One of the trademarks of bitcoins since they were created by anonymous programmers in 2009 has been that they have no physical form, and can be exchanged completely electronically, making human interactions unnecessary. But the online venues for buying and selling bitcoins have become too expensive and time consuming, Mr. Rossi said. So he proposed what he called Project Buttonwood, a reference to the where the New York Stock Exchange had its beginning in 1792. “If I want to buy a hamburger, I want to be able to sell my bitcoins and get my money immediately so I can buy that hamburger,” said Mr. Rossi, who wore jeans and loafers for the occasion, and smoked a cigarette while watching the proceedings. The legality of bitcoin has been questioned by some regulators, and investors have looked on in horror in recent weeks as the price of a single bitcoin has bounced around more sharply than the most speculative stock. Mr. Rossi’s posting about the event on Reddit was sniped at by one commentator who said “you might get busted by the Feds” and another who predicted “the first bitcoin ‘gang’ fight.” In the end, such dire predictions did not pan out. After a slow start at 4 p.m., just as trading on the New York Stock Exchange shut down for the day, the crowd grew to about 20 people. There were a few polite arguments about how the process should work, and then people began calling out prices at which they were willing to buy and sell bitcoins. Many of the young men alternated between conversation and watching the nearby skateboarders and break dancers. The first transaction came when Mr. Rossi pulled out a $20 bill in order to buy a part of a bitcoin, at a rate of $120 for a single bitcoin. The seller was Owen Gunden, a 30-year old programmer.  In order to transfer the online currency, Mr. Rossi used his smartphone to take a picture of the graphic code on Mr. Gunden’s phone, which provided access to his bitcoin account. The crowd around the men clapped. “This is markets becoming more efficient,” Mr. Rossi said with a smile. Nearby, Kirill Gourov, a 21-year old college student, said he was looking to buy a bitcoin for $125 and was serving as a broker for a friend who was text messaging him, and who wanted to sell his bitcoin for $112. The gap between the bid and offer in Union Square was significantly larger than it was at the same time on the biggest online exchange, Mt. Gox, where the going price was around $114. But before long, a few more buyers and sellers met. Gabe Sukenik, the 24-year old founder of a bitcoin start-up, Coinapult, pulled out a wad of $20 bills and counted out enough cash to buy two bitcoins from a young man who identified himself as a Wall Street trader. “I’ll flip a coin for a hundred bucks if you want,” said the trader. “That’s my risk tolerance.” As the afternoon went on, a man who gave his name as Jerry, took out a notebook and began recording the trickle of trades. He jokingly said he would serve as the exchange’s clerk if someone bought him a Coke. “We’re here enjoying the sunshine, enjoying the ladies, and trying to move the bitcoin community along,” Jerry said. Mr. Rossi said he planned to be back in the same place next Monday.",0.00485142857142857,0.07864529650243936

Over the course of less than two weeks the price of the “digital currency” more than tripled. Then it fell more than 50 percent in a few hours. Suddenly, it felt as if we were back in the dot-com era. The economic significance of this roller coaster was basically nil. But the furor over bitcoin was a useful lesson in the ways people misunderstand money — and in particular how they are misled by the desire to divorce the value of money from the society it serves. What is bitcoin? It’s sometimes described as a way to make transactions online — but that in itself would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions. In fact, the Commerce Department estimates that by 2010 about 16 percent of total sales in America already took the form of e-commerce. So how is bitcoin different? Unlike credit card transactions, which leave a digital trail, bitcoin transactions are designed to be anonymous and untraceable. When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it’s as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley. And sure enough, as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items. But bitcoin evangelists insist that it’s about much more than greasing the path for illicit transactions. The biggest declared investors in bitcoins are the Winklevoss brothers, wealthy twins who successfully sued for a share of Facebook and were made famous by the movie “The Social Network” — and they make claims for the digital product similar to those made by goldbugs for their favorite metal. “We have elected,” declared Tyler Winklevoss recently, “to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error.”  The similarity to goldbug rhetoric isn’t a coincidence, since goldbugs and bitcoin enthusiasts — bitbugs? — tend to share both libertarian politics and the belief that governments are vastly abusing their power to print money. At the same time, it’s very peculiar, since bitcoins are in a sense the ultimate fiat currency, with a value conjured out of thin air. Gold’s value comes in part because it has nonmonetary uses, such as filling teeth and making jewelry; paper currencies have value because they’re backed by the power of the state, which defines them as legal tender and accepts them as payment for taxes. Bitcoins, however, derive their value, if any, purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment. However, let’s leave that strangeness on one side, along with the peculiar “mining” process — actually a process of complex calculation — used to add to the bitcoin stock. Instead, let’s focus on the two huge misconceptions — one practical, one philosophical — that underlie both goldbugism and bitbugism. The practical misconception here — and it’s a big one — is the notion that we live in an era of wildly irresponsible money printing, with runaway inflation just around the corner. It’s true that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have greatly expanded their balance sheets — but they’ve done that explicitly as a temporary measure in response to economic crisis. I know, government officials are not to be trusted and all that, but the truth is that Ben Bernanke’s promises that his actions wouldn’t be inflationary have been vindicated year after year, while goldbugs’ dire warnings of inflation keep not coming true. The philosophical misconception, however, seems to me to be even bigger. Goldbugs and bitbugs alike seem to long for a pristine monetary standard, untouched by human frailty. But that’s an impossible dream. Money is, as Paul Samuelson once declared, a “social contrivance,” not something that stands outside society. Even when people relied on gold and silver coins, what made those coins useful wasn’t the precious metals they contained, it was the expectation that other people would accept them as payment. Actually, you’d expect the Winklevosses, of all people, to get this, because in a way money is like a social network, which is useful only to the extent that other people use it. But I guess some people are just bothered by the notion that money is a human thing, and want the benefits of the monetary network without the social part. Sorry, it can’t be done. So do we need a new form of money? I guess you could make that case if the money we actually have were misbehaving. But it isn’t. We have huge economic problems, but green pieces of paper are doing fine — and we should let them alone. ",0.19448235294117644,0.0672998366013072
338,Never Mind Facebook; Winklevoss Twins Rule in Digital Money,https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/as-big-investors-emerge-bitcoin-gets-ready-for-its-close-up/?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2013-04-11T19:11:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler — Olympic rowers, nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg — are laying claim to a new title: bitcoin moguls. The Winklevii, as they are known, have amassed since last summer what appears to be one of the single largest portfolios of the digital money, whose wild gyrations have Silicon Valley and Wall Street talking. The twins, the first prominent figures in the largely anonymous bitcoin world to publicly disclose a big stake, say they own nearly $11 million worth.  Or at least $11 million as of Thursday morning — when trading was temporarily suspended after the latest and largest flash crash left a single bitcoin worth about $120 and the whole market worth $1.3 billion. At one point, the price had plummeted 60 percent. To skeptics, the frenzy over the bitcoin network created by anonymous programmers in 2009 looks more like the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1600s than the beginnings of an actual currency. “To say highly speculative would be the understatement of the century,” said Steve Hanke, a professor specializing in alternative currencies at Johns Hopkins University. Whatever else it is, bitcoin has become the financial phenomenon of the moment. In addition to the identical twins, Silicon Valley investment firms, while not holding bitcoins, are starting to show interest in the technology. On Thursday, a group of venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz, announced that they were financing a bitcoin-related company, OpenCoin. The Winklevosses say this week’s tumult is just growing pains for a digital currency that they believe will become a sort of gold for the technorati. “People say it’s a Ponzi scheme, it’s a bubble,” said Cameron Winklevoss. “People really don’t want to take it seriously. At some point that narrative will shift to ‘virtual currencies are here to stay.’ We’re in the early days.” While little is known about the creator of bitcoin, or if it even was a single person, the work involved serious programming chops, building a system that could live on borrowed computer space around the world. It was determined that only a finite number of bitcoins could be created — the count is currently around 11 million. New coins are “mined” by programmers who solve mathematic riddles and can sell their coins on upstart exchanges. For now, there are few places where bitcoins can be used. One marketplace is an online bazaar, Silk Road, where narcotics are reportedly the main wares for sale. But bitcoin believers imagine a future where the e-cash can be used at their local Starbucks. The Winklevosses have paid in bitcoin for the services of a Ukrainian computer programmer who has worked on their Web site. “We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error,” Tyler Winklevoss said. This is not the brothers’ first gamble on an unproved technology. As students at Harvard, the twins founded a social networking site, ConnectU, and enlisted their schoolmate, Mark Zuckerberg, to help them build the company. After Mr. Zuckerberg went off to start Facebook, the brothers sued him, accusing him of stealing their idea — a story that was dramatized in the movie “The Social Network.” The case was settled with the brothers being given $20 million in cash and Facebook shares that are now worth more than $200 million. They have parlayed that fortune into Winklevoss Capital. Their first two investments were in Hukkster, a start-up shopping Web site and SumZero, an online community for professional money managers. The brothers began dabbling in bitcoin last summer when the dollar value of a single coin was still in the single digits. To keep their holdings secure from hackers, they have taken the complex codes that represent their holdings off networked computers and saved them on small flash drives, putting the drives, in turn, in safe deposit boxes at banks in three different cities. It’s hard to verify how the Winklevoss holdings compare with other bitcoin players, given the anonymity of accounts, and the twins say they believe that some early users of the system probably have holdings that are at least as large. A Maltese company, Exante, started a hedge fund that the company says has bought up about 82,000 bitcoins — or about $10 million as of Thursday — with money from wealthy investors. A founder of the fund, Anatoli Knyazev, said his main concern was hackers and government regulators, who have so far mostly left the currency alone. These investments were all in an uncertain state on Thursday after the big price swings and the shutdown of trading on Mt. Gox, a Japanese-based company that claims to handle 80 percent of all bitcoin trades. Mt. Gox said in a statement that the problems were a result of the currency’s popularity, making it impossible to process all the incoming orders. It added that it was not the victim of hackers but “instead victim of our own success!” The 6-foot-5 Winklevoss brothers were unfazed. The brothers said they took advantage of the low prices to buy more. “It has been four years and it has yet to be discredited as a viable alternative to fiat currency,” Tyler Winklevoss said. “We could be totally wrong, but we are curious to see this play out a lot more.”",0.09329,0.05133418367346938

When Mr. Grinberg, now a lawyer in the financial institutions group of the Manhattan law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, first learned about bitcoins, they were selling for 10 cents. Now, after the latest price surge that began in January, the cost of a bitcoin on an exchange that converts them to dollars is something like $140, and the collective value of all bitcoins has passed a billion dollars.  That is a lot of coin in any form, and the billion-dollar milestone has turned the once-obscure online currency into a media sensation. Had Mr. Grinberg invested just $100 back then, today his investment would be worth ... Ah, but that way madness lies. “People are buying bitcoins because the price is going up,” he said in an interview. “That is the classic indicator of a bubble.”  The question of whether the increase represents real value or is simply evidence of a bubble is at the heart of the current media frenzy. Bitcoin began in January 2009, a project introduced by a programmer or group of programmers who worked under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.  The project represented a breakthrough in using software code to authenticate and protect transactions without resorting to a centralized bank or government treasury. In that way, Bitcoin became a peer-to-peer system. That comes in pretty handy for people who do not want their transactions monitored. In conversations about the project with scholars who study it, the word that comes up as often as “bubble” is “genius.” For one thing, though bitcoins are software code, you can’t simply copy them like a music file. The process of creating the coins — “mining” them in the project’s allusion to something tangible like gold or silver — involves computer work that, crucially, verifies Bitcoin transactions. “It is the most successful digital currency already right now,” said Nicolas Christin, the associate director of the Information Networking Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. “Even if bitcoins become worth nothing, it has succeeded more than any academic proposals for a digital currency,” he said in an interview from Okinawa, Japan, where he was attending a conference on financial cryptography that included a number of papers on bitcoins.  People buy the coins for cold hard cash on exchanges. Completing those purchases, as well as cashing out, typically involves re-entering the world of traditional financial transactions, with fees and loss of anonymity. But Bitcoin’s managers say the currency has proved so secure that despite the fact that exchanges and virtual wallets, where people keep their bitcoins, have been hacked, the coins themselves have not been forged. So why the sudden run-up in value? Some point to the recent crisis over Cypriot banks, which made a currency beyond the control of governments more tempting. And as with a run-up in anything tradable — tulip bulbs, dot-com shares — there is also the hypnotic logic that says the price went up today, so that means it will go up tomorrow. Some observers and investors also make the case that bitcoins are in fact undervalued. Their argument goes like this. The total value of the world’s economic activity is enormous. There are certain transactions that are ideal for bitcoins because the currency is relatively anonymous and does not need to be processed by a financial organization or a government. If bitcoins become the dominant currency in some small niche of the world economy — that is, those people who do not want their transactions easily tracked or who want to send money back home from abroad — then they will become quite valuable indeed. This outcome has been neatly summarized by the financial blogger Felix Salmon as making bitcoins an “uncomfortable combination of commodity and currency.”  The price increase becomes a question of supply and demand. Unlike other currencies that can adjust the money supply depending on economic conditions, bitcoins have a supply that is fixed. The amount of new coins that can be minted was plotted at the outset with a finite number of coins at the end, roughly 21 million in the next century. Today, the rate is 25 new coins every 10 minutes; for the first four years, it was twice as many, 50 every 10 minutes. The slowdown in the rate new coins are added, which was programmed into bitcoins, may also help account for the spike in prices. So far, excluding investors and day traders, the main use of the currency appears to be illicit activity. There are the online gambling sites that use bitcoins. And the anonymous online marketplace Silk Road, which accepts only bitcoins, is “overwhelmingly used as a market for controlled substances and narcotics,” according to a paper on Silk Road written by Mr. Christin of Carnegie Mellon. He used clues on the site, including buyer feedback reports, to calculate how much and what kind of business was being transacted. His conclusion, as of July 2012, was that $1.2 million in business was carried out each month, much of it for buying small amounts of narcotics that were delivered by mail. “We did see it was growing,” he said of the total value of the trades. “It pretty much doubled in the six months I followed it.”  Excluding the traders, he said, “Silk Road probably represents a sizable amount of bitcoin exchanges, but not more than half.” Supporters of the Bitcoin project acknowledge these statistics but argue that it can still thrive as a mainstream currency. “I think when you talk about Silk Road, you are talking about the first early adopter market — there is no other solution that works,” said Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that manages the project. When the currency evolves to be more useful and better known, he said, it will be used for more mundane transactions.  Even the idea that it is experiencing a bubble — and Mr. Andresen said in an interview by phone from Amherst, Mass., “I think it definitely is a frenzy” — is for the best. “Eventually the media gets bored and moves on to the next thing,” he said, “and what is left behind is a whole new wave of people interested.” And, he says, a much lower price for bitcoins. As evidence of mainstream interest, Mr. Andresen pointed to the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose, Calif., next month, which is attracting entrepreneurs with Silicon Valley venture capital backing. The list of panelists is heavy with start-up executives, but includes some activists — including representatives from the Web site Antiwar.com and the Electronic Frontier Foundation — who see a currency outside of government regulation as crucial to financing projects that criticize the authorities. Mr. Andresen is not a mere bystander to the fluctuations in bitcoin prices. As an employee of the Bitcoin Foundation, after working as volunteer on the software, he is paid in bitcoins, with the rate set every three months. In 2013, his salary in terms of dollars has increased more than tenfold. Starting in April, however, the foundation has decided that, because of those fluctuations, his bitcoin salary would be adjusted each month, he said. Still, that alone makes this bubble different than many in the past: the creators are not looking to get their money and make a quick exit.",0.16107999999999997,0.0950355831037649

Clearly someone on the show’s staff was familiar enough with the Bitcoin story to know that beyond all the technological, economic and legal issues it raises — which were treated superficially but reasonably intelligently during the episode — lies a terrific real-life mystery: who invented it? The  developer of record, Satoshi Nakamoto, is assumed to be a pseudonym; Nakamoto wasn’t mentioned, as far as I could tell, but the true identity of the Bitcoin inventor was the crux of the episode (which involved a federal investigation that as yet has no parallel in the real world).

Alicia, in line with the show’s cutesy habit of having the (formidably intelligent) parents turn to their children for tech support, said during the Bitcoin discussions, “This stuff makes me feel so dated,” which only succeeded in making the show feel dated. Jason Biggs was the main guest star, as the central suspect in the government’s investigation; it’s still hard for me to see him as anything other than a comedian, but he was good here in a form-fitting role as a smart-aleck geek. Jennifer Ferrin, known for  noble, suffering mothers (“Life on Mars,” “The Cape”), got to play sharp and sexy for a change as another of the suspects. Not so pleasant: the self-promoting appearance in the witness stand by Jim Cramer of CNBC. But I’m burying the lede here. There were major developments in Will’s corruption case (the one that threatens to bring down Lockhart Gardner but is played out in brief, interstitial scenes). After weeks of wondering what the actual evidence might be against Will, we were let in on the secret: when he stopped gambling, he still owed his bookie $8,000, and the bookie forgave the debt.  That’s it? $8,000? Apparently it’s enough to create an impression that the bookie’s presence at Will’s pick-up basketball games was a quid pro quo. But my immediate reaction was, come on, that’s the best you can do? Did someone think that up during a bathroom break? (And are we really supposed to believe that that would be enough to make Will let the bookie into the games,  a lapse that has never made sense? Or are we supposed to think that it was just Will’s addictive, aggressive personality?)  Other revelations and skullduggery followed, revealed through  the Kalinda-Dana flirtation. The state plans to use Alicia’s allegedly forged signature on the divorce document from the previous episode as a wedge against Will, forcing him into a legal and romantic corner and allowing for some highly charged future scenes.  The immediate problem, though, is a Lockhart Gardner case file that contains information damaging to Will. He can’t ask Kalinda to do anything with it, but his stare at her across the desk is meant to communicate something.  We might expect her to get rid of it, but the next time we see the file, Kalinda is delivering it to Will’s persecutors, in the person of Dana. This of course can’t be as straightforward as it looks. But what game is Kalinda playing? Has she doctored the contents of the file? Is she selling out Will to protect Alicia? Is she working a back-door deal with Cary? Your guesses are welcome in the comments. Best moment in the episode: Zach’s guileless manipulation of his mother, using Alicia’s liberal guilt and her hatred of Jackie to ensure an open-door policy for his new girlfriend, Nisa.

341,Drug Dealers Targeted in Sweep of Illicit Online Marketplaces,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/drug-dealers-dark-web-arrests.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-27T00:10:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"WASHINGTON — More than 35 people were charged with selling drugs on the so-called dark web, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday, marking the first time that federal prosecutors made the sellers of illegal goods their primary focus rather than the operators of illicit online marketplaces. Investigators seized opioids, cocaine and other drugs, more than 100 guns and assault rifles, a grenade launcher and five cars in a broad federal inquiry in which prosecutors opened more than 90 cases. They also took nearly $24 million in cash, gold, and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “Criminals who think that they are safe on the dark net are wrong,” the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, said in a statement, using another term for the dark web, where people can use encryption and electronic currencies to hide their identities. “We can expose their networks.” Homeland Security investigators posed as a money launderer who exchanged virtual currencies on the dark web, the authorities said. “Special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyberunderworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit,” said Derek Benner, acting executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. “H.S.I. has infiltrated the dark net.” The suspects were mostly in their 20s and 30s. Scattered across the country in states like New York, Maryland, Ohio, California and Vermont, they sold a variety of drugs including opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, prosecutors said. In most cases they accepted Bitcoin as payment, then attempted to launder that money through undercover agents who exchanged the coins for cash. The agents then had mailing addresses for the vendors, and were able to obtain data about who had owned the coins. Bitcoin has long been the currency of choice for those looking to purchase illegal goods online. Its appeal is obvious: The currency is controlled by no bank or government, and it can be difficult to conclusively link a Bitcoin to a person. But every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on what is known as a ledger called the blockchain. If you know what to look for, the transactions are essentially public. Cybersecurity experts have predicted that Bitcoin’s structure would eventually allow law enforcement to use it to make arrests. The government could also compel companies who trade in Bitcoin to hand over information about those using the cryptocurrency, cybersecurity experts have said. Online drug trafficking, which has long provided easy access to illegal commerce, has emerged as one of the most pernicious issues that drug enforcement officials face, James J. Hunt, the Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge, said in a statement. Drugs, weapons, child pornography, stolen financial data and other illicit materials have been bought and sold on black market websites like the Silk Road and AlphaBay, online bazaars that have been targeted by law enforcement authorities. Some of those marketplaces have become hubs for sales of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that has become a driver of the nation’s opioid addiction crisis. But the government has generally targeted the founders of those websites, rather than the vendors selling goods on their platforms. The government shut down the Silk Road and prosecuted its founder, Ross W. Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence for overseeing a global, online drug-trafficking business. Some vendors on Silk Road were also prosecuted. Last July, the Justice Department seized AlphaBay, then the world’s largest criminal online marketplace. Authorities arrested Alexandre Cazes, the creator and administrator of the site, on charges of racketeering, drug trafficking and fraud. Mr. Cazes committed suicide while in custody in Thailand, the Justice Department said. Newer forms of cryptocurrencies are designed to evade detection, Greg Nevano, an ICE official who investigates them, said during a hearing this month before a House Financial Services subcommittee. “Some newer cryptocurrencies have features that make the tracing of them quite complicated,” he said. “These new anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies are clearly ripe for illicit use in an effort to subvert legitimate law enforcement inquiries.” While these cryptocurrencies are more difficult to trace, “it is not impossible,” Mr. Nevano added. He said law enforcement agencies could press companies to hand over customer data or devices.",-0.06968108108108106,0.011035914160914161

Andreessen Horowitz, the well-known firm that made early bets on Instagram and Reddit, said on Monday that it was creating a $300 million fund focused exclusively on projects inspired by the original virtual currency, Bitcoin. One of the leaders of the new fund will be the firm’s first female general partner, Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor. Last year, when Bitcoin and most other virtual currencies were gaining in value, most of the large venture capital firms began beefing up on cryptocurrency expertise and making investments. Andreessen Horowitz was ahead of many of its peers. It was one of the first venture capital firms to begin dabbling in cryptocurrencies in 2013, when digital tokens were a fringe business. Now, Andreessen Horowitz appears to be the first mainstream venture capital firm to offer an investment fund focused exclusively on cryptocurrencies. The new fund — A16z Crypto — is being created at a difficult moment for the digital token markets. The price of Bitcoin has fallen by more than two-thirds since hitting a peak in December. Many smaller tokens have fallen much more than that as regulators have said many cryptocurrency projects that raised money last year had most likely done so illegally. Chris Dixon, who has been at the front of Andreessen Horowitz’s work on digital currencies, and who will be one of the leaders of the new fund, has been critical of many of the projects that raised money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. But Mr. Dixon has argued that digital tokens provide a new way to fund and create decentralized software and protocols, like those that are the foundation of the internet. Andreessen has already made investments in many tokens aiming to do this, including Filecoin and Basis. “There are two axes of progress; there is genuine innovation and the prices,” Mr. Dixon said in an interview on Monday. “The prices got ahead of the genuine innovation. The metric I look at is: Are there great entrepreneurs coming in and building great projects? On that metric I think the space is in a really strong place.” Since leaving the federal prosecutor’s office in San Francisco in 2017, Ms. Haun has taught classes on cryptocurrencies at Stanford University and joined the board of Coinbase, the largest virtual currency brokerage. Ms. Haun led the prosecution of the federal agents who stole money from the online black market Silk Road when they were supposed to be tracking down the leader of the site. Andreessen Horowitz was one of the earliest investors in Coinbase. Mr. Dixon is on the board of the company, along with Ms. Haun.",0.11273599999999999,0.14868903318903318
343,Farhad’s Week in Tech: Bitcoin and the Scams Under Everything,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/technology/bitcoin-scams.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-15T13:00:01+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Each week, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.  Good morning, readers! We’ll get to tech news in a bit, but let’s start somewhere else. My wife is a doctor who studies cancer, and one of the few things I’ve learned from her job is this unhappy little maxim: You can get cancer pretty much anywhere. Some cancers everyone has heard of. Breast, prostate, brain, lung — these are the calamities we’re familiar with. But did you know you can get cancer under your fingernails? Or in your appendix? There is even a cancer of the heart. (Don’t worry, it’s very rare.) I bring this up because I’ve noticed an analogous ubiquity on the internet: Just about everything online could be a scam. This observation isn’t revolutionary; you’ve known to be on the lookout for internet scams since the first time you made friends with a Nigerian prince. The internet is a global gathering of strangers and money, which means that a fraud, a trick, a swindle, a grift or a graft is obviously never far. And yet it is surprising how often, and how completely, many of us can be deluded into letting our guard down, thinking that what we see online really is on the up and up. Take Bitcoin. This week, John Griffin, a noted investigator of financial frauds, reported that the huge run-up in the price of Bitcoin last year was not just the product of authentic interest in Bitcoin. Instead, at least half of the price jump was most likely caused by a price-manipulation scheme organized by people associated with Bitfinex, a large Bitcoin-trading service, Mr. Griffin wrote in a lengthy paper. (Bitfinex has denied any wrongdoing.) Bitcoin, you’ll recall, is the decentralized cryptocurrency whose proponents argue that it represents the future of currency. Its key innovation, they say, is radical transparency that ensures trust among strangers. In other words, the point of Bitcoin and its underlying technology is to eliminate the kind of fraud alleged here. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a ledger, called a “blockchain,” that is maintained by a network of computers rather than by a central institution, like a bank or an accounting firm. Proponents of Bitcoin and blockchains argue that centralized ledgers are inherently prone to trickery and fraud; look at Bernie Madoff or Enron. A decentralized ledger, they say, creates a much more efficient way to ensure trust on a network like the internet. Blockchains “could drastically reduce the cost of trust by means of a radical, decentralized approach to accounting — and, by extension, create a new way to structure economic organizations,” wrote Michael J. Casey and Paul Vigna, the authors of a book called “The Truth Machine: The Blockchain and the Future of Everything.” The fraud alleged by Mr. Griffin does not suggest any flaw in the blockchain itself, but it does go far in undercutting the high-flying rhetoric about how blockchains might usher in a new era of far-flung trust. Even though all of Bitcoin’s transactions are recorded on a blockchain, the transparency didn’t seem to inhibit trickery here. Mr. Griffin spotted patterns that suggested manipulators were using another virtual currency, Tether, which was issued by Bitfinex, to prop up the price of Bitcoin when it sagged. These apparent manipulations were recorded on the blockchain — that record is how Mr. Griffin’s team came to its conclusions. But even though the possibility of manipulation was mentioned often last year, it took months to put together detailed evidence that it had happened. And in that time, the whole world — the financial press, ordinary investors, anyone looking for the next windfall — put more money into Bitcoin. Even though lots of people should have known better — even though we all know the internet is lousy with scams — Bitcoin, we were told, was different. Nope, it wasn’t. Scams are everywhere online. Never let your guard down. Other stuff: ■ Ben Thompson had a fine analysis this week on the economics of shared scooters. The sudden invasion of electric scooters has caused a lot of angst in San Francisco and elsewhere, but Thompson dives into the financials and finds a phenomenon that is rare in digital businesses: This market doesn’t seem to be headed toward monopoly. ■ The Washington Post had a fascinating look at how WhatsApp is changing politics in Brazil. Because the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook, lets citizens create instant and flexible organized groups, it is undermining traditional political players like unions and “injecting a level of unpredictability and radicalization into a country beset by economic and political crises.” ■ In the hours after news of Anthony Bourdain’s suicide, Newsweek rushed out lots of stories “optimized not for humanity but for search engines,” Bijan Stephen wrote in The Verge, in a disturbing look at the soul-crushing incentives of online publishing.

344,Stephen Bannon Buys Into Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/technology/steve-bannon-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-14T09:00:09+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics. Mr. Bannon won’t reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans — he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground. But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon & Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a “good stake” in Bitcoin. In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the “deplorables coin.” The name is a nod to Hillary Clinton’s description of Mr. Trump’s supporters as “a basket of deplorables.” The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies — generally outside the United States. The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street. It is not a shocking place for Mr. Bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. Cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into Tea Party politics: They break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots. “It’s disruptive populism,” Mr. Bannon said in the interview at his Capitol Hill townhouse in Washington. “It takes control back from central authorities. It’s revolutionary.” Even though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, Mr. Bannon still refers to his townhouse as the Breitbart Embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site’s business was done there. While Breitbart editors and writers no longer linger at all hours inside the embassy, remnants of the website remain in Breitbart mementos hanging from the wall and coffee mugs with the signature block B logo strewn about the kitchen. Mr. Bannon still accepts a steady stream of visitors who provide him intelligence and gossip from the conservative circles he once commanded. But these days he is just as likely to be convening meetings there on his new financial venture. He won’t talk about a possible return to politics someday. His messy rupture with the White House over critical comments he made in Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury” about colleagues and Donald Trump Jr. is still too fresh. But he does see a political component to virtual currency. “It was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,” Mr. Bannon said. His vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. He sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants Wall Street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that “debase your currency” and make citizens “slaves to debt.” His focus on creating new digital tokens, which are usually offered through initial coin offerings, puts him squarely in the edgiest, most scam-filled slice of the cryptocurrency business. New companies have raised billions through these I.C.O.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. That has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down. Mr. Bannon’s involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. They fear he will further cement the technology’s reputation as a plaything of fringe elements. “It almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,” said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser. Bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. That lack of oversight has made Bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes. Bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year. Cryptocurrencies are also gaining mainstream interest. Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Bannon worked in the 1980s, recently said it was creating a Bitcoin trading operation. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been looking at building an exchange for digital tokens. And Facebook has put top executives on a project exploring use of the technology. These big companies are generally trying to take the technology away from its radical political roots. But Mr. Bannon is hoping to embrace those roots. “Control of the currency,” he said, “is control of everything.” Timothy Lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with Mr. Bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which Mr. Bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces. “I didn’t know what to expect going in, but he had clearly done his homework,” said Mr. Lewis, who is a co-founder of the Ikigai hedge fund, which invests in cryptocurrency projects. He said they had talked about the laws governing new cryptocurrencies and a few initial coin offerings that had recently raised money from investors. Mr. Bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth — an Italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance. He found his way into the virtual currency universe through Brock Pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like “The Mighty Ducks” before starting a company in Hong Kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game World of Warcraft. The company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, or IGE, brought on Mr. Bannon as vice chairman in 2005 to help Mr. Pierce expand the business and deal with legal threats. Mr. Bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement. Since leaving IGE in 2007, Mr. Pierce has become involved with a wide array of virtual currency projects, including an effort to create a cryptocurrency enclave in Puerto Rico that takes advantage of the island’s low taxes, and a new virtual currency known as EOS, which has raised over $3 billion. Mr. Bannon said he would have gotten involved with Mr. Pierce and cryptocurrencies back in 2016 if the Trump campaign hadn’t intervened. Mr. Pierce’s big claims for cryptocurrencies — and a recent turn toward new age spiritualism — have made him a target for critics. John Oliver, on his HBO comedy show, recently held up Mr. Pierce as an emblem of the bombast that floats around the virtual currency community. After the segment, the company that created EOS said Mr. Pierce had left the company. Mr. Bannon is not bothered by the mockery. Other causes he has taken on have worked out well despite low expectations. “These guys are visionaries,” he said.",0.1138746835443038,0.0570349060222478

The paper by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, is likely to stoke a debate about how much of Bitcoin’s skyrocketing gain last year was caused by the covert actions of a few big players, rather than real demand from investors. Many industry players expressed concern at the time that the prices were being pushed up at least partly by activity at Bitfinex, one of the largest and least regulated exchanges in the industry. The exchange, which is registered in the Caribbean with offices in Asia, was subpoenaed by American regulators shortly after articles about the concerns appeared in The New York Times and other publications. Mr. Griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens going in and out of Bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to push up prices when they sagged at other exchanges. To do that, the person or people used a secondary virtual currency, known as Tether, which was created and sold by the owners of Bitfinex, to buy up those other cryptocurrencies. “There were obviously tremendous price increases last year, and this paper indicates that manipulation played a large part in those price increases,” Mr. Griffin said. [Steve Bannon has a “good stake” in Bitcoin and floated the idea of creating a “deplorables coin.”] Bitfinex executives have denied in the past that the exchange was involved in any manipulation. The company said on Wednesday that it had never engaged in “any sort” of market or price manipulation. “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex,” Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, Bitfinex’s chief executive, said in a statement. The new paper helped push down the already sinking price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Wednesday. The price of Bitcoin fell as much as 5 percent after the report was published, approaching its lowest point of the year. Bitcoin is now down more than 65 percent from the highs it hit late last year. The authors of the new 66-page paper do not have emails or documents that prove that Bitfinex knew about or was responsible for price manipulation. The researchers relied on the millions of transaction records that are captured on the public ledgers of all virtual currency transactions, known as the blockchain, to spot patterns. This method is not conclusive, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past. In particular, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Shams examined the flow of Tether, a token that is supposed to be tied to the value of the dollar and that is issued exclusively by Bitfinex in large batches. They found that half of the increase in Bitcoin’s price in 2017 could be traced to the hours immediately after Tether flowed to a handful of other exchanges, generally when the price was declining. Other large virtual currencies that can be purchased with Tether, such as Ether and Zcash, rose even more quickly than Bitcoin in those periods. The prices rose much more quickly on exchanges that accepted Tether than they did on those that did not, and the pattern ceased when Bitfinex stopped issuing new Tether this year, the authors found. Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor at the University College London who pioneered this sort of pattern spotting, said the analysis in the new paper “seems sound” after reviewing it this week. Philip Gradwell, the chief economist at Chainalysis, a firm that analyses blockchain data, also said the study “seems credible.” He cautioned that a full understanding of the patterns would require more analysis. Mr. Griffin previously wrote research pointing to fraudulent behavior in several other financial markets. He drew attention for a 2016 paper that suggested that a popular financial contract tied to the volatility in financial markets, known as the VIX, was being manipulated. A whistle-blower later came forward to confirm those suspicions, and now several active lawsuits are focused on the allegations. Beyond his work at the University of Texas, Mr. Griffin has a consulting firm that works on financial fraud cases, including some in the virtual currency industry. “The relationship between Tether and the price of Bitcoin has been flagged for months within the community,” said Christian Catalini, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in blockchain research. “It is great to see academic work trying to causally assess if market manipulation is taking place.” The new paper is not the first academic work to identify manipulation in the virtual currency markets. A paper published last year by a team of Israeli and American researchers said much of Bitcoin’s big price increase in 2013 was caused by a campaign of price manipulation at what was then the biggest exchange, Mt. Gox.",-0.027477777777777775,0.0528269467158356
346,One Firm Is Way Ahead of Wall Street on Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/technology/bitcoin-susquehanna.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-06-05T20:40:56+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — While a number of large financial institutions have discussed trading Bitcoin, one firm has already begun doing it. Very quietly. The financial firm, Susquehanna International Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., just outside Philadelphia, is one of the largest players in trading traditional investments like stocks, options and exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s. Over the last two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals. Now the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand. The move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets, which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange, has been in talks about opening a subsidiary for cryptocurrency trading, and Goldman Sachs is on the verge of opening its own trading operation. But Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk — and a lot more ability to interact with clients — than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets. The arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some Bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden Bitcoin’s status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions. Not so, said Bart Smith, the head of the digital asset group at Susquehanna. The firm believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, Bitcoin’s best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily. The original Bitcoin software determined that only 21 million Bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isn’t expected to be hit until 2140, and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity. Mr. Smith said that he could also imagine Bitcoin, or some competitor, becoming a digital payment method for the internet — as Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, recently predicted — but that he wasn’t too worried if that didn’t happen. “We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” he said. Susquehanna first experimented with trading Bitcoin in 2014 after the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked the firm about being involved with a Bitcoin E.T.F. that they had applied to regulators to create. Regulators eventually denied that application. But Susquehanna kept its one Bitcoin trader on board, and then added a few more last year when the cryptocurrency markets took off. The firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of Bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing volume in recent months. Susquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of Bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin Cash. To make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license that it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies — though not Bitcoin — should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities. Most of the cryptocurrency exchanges where Susquehanna trades are largely unregulated. Bloomberg recently reported that American authorities were investigating whether some traders were taking advantage of this to manipulate the price of Bitcoin by posting lots of trades that they didn’t intend to complete. Mr. Smith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies. He said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesn’t have actual custody of stocks or bonds. Bitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several Bitcoin exchanges. Susquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day. To deter hackers, the private keys are kept in devices in an off-site facility that is not connected to the rest of the company’s computer systems. “There were no financial services firms out there two years ago that were storing and moving large amounts of cryptocurrencies, so there is no road map,” he said. Then there is the matter of trying to figure out on a daily basis what a single Bitcoin or Ether token should be worth. There is still little agreement on what factors traders should take account of when deciding on a value for cryptocurrencies, given that many of the expected uses for digital tokens are still hypothetical. While Mr. Smith’s teams look at the technical and security specifications of the coins, it is much harder to answer the most important question: Will they be used as something other than a digital commodity? “The value is: What do you think the best-case scenario of these different digital assets is in the future — and handicapping what is the percentage chance that they will get there,” he said.",0.14766190476190477,0.07509656514120801
347,Policing Cryptocurrencies Has Become a Game of Whack-a-Mole for Regulators,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/business/dealbook/bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-regulation.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-31T23:39:07+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The lure of quick riches has attracted a growing number of investors to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. It has also drawn scam artists. The nonprofit Anti-Phishing Working Group estimated that about $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies has been stolen since early 2017. Just this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency court order halting an initial coin offering by Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services that the agency claimed had defrauded investors out of about $21 million. Regulators have become so concerned about misconduct that the S.E.C. even unveiled a fake website for an initial offering of HoweyCoins — a play on a 1946 Supreme Court case that gave a broad definition of what constitutes a “security” — to demonstrate just how easy it is for investors to be fooled into parting with their money. But fighting fraud in virtual currencies has almost become a game of Whac-A-Mole for regulators and federal prosecutors, who find each new iteration seemingly a few steps ahead them. The challenge the authorities face is that cryptocurrencies are so new that they do not fit neatly into laws that were passed decades ago prohibiting misconduct in the securities and commodities markets. It will take time for those regulations to catch up. Bloomberg reported that federal prosecutors were working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to determine whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike fraudulent schemes or theft from individual investors, this type of conduct cuts to the heart of the market for virtual currencies. It means that prices may not reflect any true value but instead are being driven up or down artificially by those seeking to profit. The S.E.C.’s jurisdiction only covers investments used to help fund companies, and Bitcoin hardly fits that model. Instead, the agency has focused on companies using initial coin offerings to raise money, arguing that doing so is the same as selling stocks or bonds to investors, and therefore the complex securities registration rules must be followed. The trading commission may have better luck policing transactions in cryptocurrencies. A decision in March by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn held that virtual currencies “are ‘goods’ exchanged in a market for a uniform quality and value,” so they come within the definition in the Commodity Exchange Act that covers “all other goods and articles.” That means trading designed to defraud investors or manipulate the price of a commodity is subject to civil and criminal prosecution. The decision was the first designating cryptocurrencies as a commodity. Whether other courts will agree is an open question. Defendants are sure to challenge any charges based on violating the commodity laws. They would most likely argue that virtual currencies are a medium of exchange rather than a commodity like gold or wheat. Even if the commodity laws apply, proving manipulation can be difficult. The government must show that the trader intended to artificially affect the price. The Federal District Court in Manhattan once explained that “entering into a legitimate transaction knowing that it will distort the market is not manipulation — only intent, not knowledge, can transform a legitimate transaction into manipulation.” One challenge to proving a defendant tried to inflate (or deflate) the price of cryptocurrencies is that, unlike stocks, they are not traded on centralized exchanges. Even simply gathering information on trades may be a challenge for prosecutors and regulators trying to prove manipulation. Moreover, virtual currencies can be traded from just about anywhere on the planet, so even if there is a pattern of suspicious orders the perpetrators may be beyond the reach of federal authorities. Still, federal prosecutors possess two powerful weapons that are not available to the financial regulators at the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C.: the mail and wire fraud statutes. These laws cover deception and schemes to defraud involving valuable property, including intangibles like Bitcoin and Ether. Although cryptocurrency trading firms often call themselves “exchanges,” they are not registered with the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C, and their clients have none of the protections afforded investors who trade stocks and commodities. If the government is serious about monitoring the markets for cryptocurrencies, it will need to require the trading firms to comply with the rules for exchanges, which include extensive record-keeping provisions. Perhaps in a nod to the inevitability of greater regulation, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency trading venue, is in talks with the S.E.C. about registering as a brokerage firm so that it can trade assets like Bitcoin and other tokens while complying with the securities laws. The company could create what is called an “alternative trading system” for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and tokens. Doing so would subject the firm to extensive capital and customer protection requirements along with oversight by the S.E.C. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. Coinbase clients could only trade assets that are properly registered with the S.E.C., another step toward treating cryptocurrencies as subject to the registration and disclosure requirements of the federal securities and commodity law. Although becoming a broker would be costly, Coinbase could use that status as a marketing tool by telling potential customers that they will be much safer trading through its platform rather than unregulated firms that could see assets stolen or prices manipulated. Much like car companies tout their safety measures under rules they long fought, a broker can offer much greater client protection that customers may be willing to pay for. As the value of cryptocurrencies swing wildly and those looking to abuse their investors proliferate, it may be up to Congress to finally designate an agency to be responsible for overseeing the markets. As I proposed in February, maybe it is time to create a Crypto-Cop to bring some order to the system and combat those looking for an opportunity to cheat and steal.",-0.027907142857142856,0.005910543931377263

Someone — it still isn’t clear who — had called the police and falsely claimed that a shooter at the home had killed someone and taken a hostage. After the police left, Mr. Lopp received a call threatening more mayhem if he did not make a large ransom payment in Bitcoin. To scare off future attackers, Mr. Lopp quickly posted a video on Twitter of himself firing off his AR-15 rifle. He also decided he was going to make it much harder for his enemies — and anyone else — to find him ever again. Mr. Lopp, a self-described libertarian who works for a Bitcoin security company, had long been obsessed with the value of privacy, and he set out to learn how thoroughly a person can escape the all-seeing eyes of corporate America and the government. But he wanted to do it without giving up internet access and moving to a shack in the woods. Many celebrities and wealthy people, wary of thieves, paparazzi and other predators, have tried to achieve Mr. Lopp’s vision of complete privacy. Few have succeeded. Mr. Lopp viewed the exercise as something of an experiment, to find out the lengths he’d have to go to extricate himself from the databases and other repositories that hold our personal information and make it available to anyone willing to pay for it.  That helps explain why he was willing to describe the steps he’s taken with me (though he did so from a burner phone, without disclosing his new location). People end up in databases when they fill out forms to buy property, register for credit cards or complete run-of-the-mill transactions. Because Mr. Lopp wanted to continue to do such normal consumer things, he needed a new name and address that wouldn’t give away his personal information. When he asked lawyers who specialize in privacy the best way to do this, he was told to create a limited liability company, or L.L.C., to serve as his new identity. Creating a corporation is not difficult. But in most states, Mr. Lopp would be registered as the owner. That would make him easy to track down if someone learned the name of the L.L.C. Nevada, Wyoming and New Mexico, however, don’t require corporations to record their owner. Mr. Lopp took advantage of that. For good measure, he set up a few corporations to use in different situations, in case an adversary tied him to any one L.L.C. Some of the most personal and widely tracked information we generate is through our financial transactions. To make new purchases that weren’t tied to him, Mr. Lopp opened a bank account with one of his new L.L.C.s and created a corporate credit card with an online company that did not require him to list his name on the card. To ensure he doesn’t tie too much information to the corporation, he makes most purchases, especially when buying something online, with prepaid debit cards that don’t list his name or his L.L.C. The most anonymous way to buy things, of course, is to simply use cash. Mr. Lopp now carries enough to handle most daily transactions. (He wouldn’t say how much.) Our phone records allow the phone companies — and anyone who subpoenas or hacks them — to know everyone whom we’ve spoken with. Mr. Lopp stopped using his old phone number, which was linked to his real name, and set up a new one under his corporate identity. He also started using a service to generate new, throwaway phone numbers that masked his master account. For his conversation with me, Mr. Lopp used a number that started with the 917 area code. “I created this number a few minutes ago and I will probably delete it shortly thereafter,” he said. “And it will only cost me a few dollars to do that.” To make sure his phone wasn’t keeping a record of everywhere he’d been — and potentially transmitting it to apps he was using — he turned off all its geolocation services. When he drives and needs directions, he uses a dedicated GPS device that isn’t otherwise tied to him. Mr. Lopp’s old house was inextricably tied to him, so he and his dog needed a new one. (He doesn’t have any children, and he declined to comment on whether he has a significant other living with him.) When he found a property to buy, he used the L.L.C. and a cashier’s check from the L.L.C.’s bank account to pay for the house in full. A mortgage was not going to be possible. Mr. Lopp didn’t want his new neighbors to blow his cover. When he introduced himself, he used a pseudonym. At first, he felt odd about giving people a fake name. Now, Mr. Lopp says, he feels weirder telling people his real name. Earlier in his career, Mr. Lopp had worked for an online marketing company that could tie internet addresses to specific customers using databases purchased from other companies. In order to shield his internet address and his location, he turned his home internet router into a virtual private network, or V.P.N., that made all his internet traffic appear to come from different internet addresses in different places. Mr. Lopp’s motorcycle and Lotus Elise sports car were registered to him through the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles. They had to go. When he purchased a new car, he picked a much less flashy model, and he used the L.L.C. to sign the papers. (He also had to get rid of vanity license plates that said BITCOIN.) To register his car, the D.M.V. insisted on a real name — not an L.L.C. — and a street address. To satisfy the D.M.V. without giving away the address of his new home, he purchased a tiny second property just for this purpose. “It’s the crappiest, cheapest hole in the wall I could find that has a physical mailbox,” he said. Mr. Lopp certainly didn’t want his new home on anyone’s mailing list, even if it was only under his L.L.C.’s name. For those times when he needed to receive mail or a delivery, he created a private mailbox at a shipping center not far from his new home. Even that felt a bit too revealing, so now he has his mail and packages shipped through a remailing service, where the shipper gets the address of a private company that receives the mail in a different state and then reroutes it to his private mailbox. There are surveillance cameras everywhere, many of them with facial-recognition software. Mr. Lopp didn’t want to get plastic surgery to completely change his appearance, so when he ventures out he wears sunglasses and a hat. He used to have a big, easily noticed beard. “It’s a more manageable length now so that I can blend into a crowd more,” he said. Attending a meeting in person would give his clients information about his travels and location. Mr. Lopp now insists on working remotely, doing any meetings by video conference in rooms where people won’t be able to identify where he is or what may be outside. When he traveled to Tokyo recently, he had no choice but to present his passport at the border. But Mr. Lopp does take precautions: He shuts down his digital devices and encrypts all of his data. That way, if a customs official turns a device back on, his information is still protected. To make sure he didn’t make any mistakes, Mr. Lopp paid private investigators to try to find him. It was an investigator who helped him figure out that his D.M.V. registration was making him vulnerable, which led him to getting a decoy address. Mr. Lopp estimates that his efforts to disappear have cost him about $30,000. He doesn’t expect too many people to follow his example, but he views the experiment as doing his part in a broader effort to lay out what it takes to reclaim privacy in the modern world. “I wanted to push the envelope,” he said, “and see what could be done.”",0.03926989247311827,0.06757727039985104

The company, Envion, said it had collected $100 million from investors this year with a plan to bring clean energy to the computers that manage Bitcoin. The project was reinforced by partnerships with German businesspeople and politicians and with a German academic institution, as well as by promises of compliance with Swiss and American laws. But like so many other projects that have pulled in millions of dollars through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, Envion is now melting down, with its creators accusing one another of fraud. The business appears to be in limbo. And investors are bonding on social media about how much they figure they lost on the project. Adam Elfarouq, a 29-year-old in Morocco, said he had put $3,000 into Envion and encouraged friends and relatives to invest their money. “I know most of the I.C.O.s out there are either fraud or won’t deliver on their promises,” he said. Envion, he believed, was different. The Envion experience is the latest reminder of how the sudden rise of virtual currencies has allowed entrepreneurs to have direct access to investors without regulatory oversight — often with financially disastrous consequences for investors. Initial coin offerings came out of almost nowhere last year to become one of the most popular ways for start-ups to raise money. Investors threw more than $5 billion at coin offerings last year. Most projects have raised money by selling custom cryptocurrencies — akin to Bitcoin — that are designed to be used as a method of payment on software the start-ups are building. The hope is that the coins will become more valuable as the software becomes more useful. But even for the people who work in the virtual-currency world, the complex structure and speed of initial coin offerings make it difficult to separate the good from the bad. Seif Shieshakly, an adviser to Envion who is based in the United Arab Emirates, said that the I.C.O. structure had “cut out so many middlemen” and created new investment opportunities, but that “the lack of regulations, again because of the infancy of I.C.O.s, carries risks that regulated environments would generally have far less of.” Regulators around the world have scrambled to stay on top of I.C.O.s. China banned coin offerings last year, and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has done a broad sweep of the industry, sending out dozens of subpoenas. But so far, the authorities have cracked down on only a few projects, and coin offerings have continued at a blazing pace, raising more money so far in 2018 than they did in all of 2017. Envion tried to separate itself from the flood of scam offerings that have popped up over the last year. A spokesman for Envion, Chris Pfaff, sent out emails last year saying it was closing deals with IBM and the ruler of Dubai. But Mr. Pfaff said last week that those deals never panned out. Envion said it would use the money collected from investors to build mobile rigs, filled with computers designed to “mine” or digitally create new Bitcoin. The rigs could be moved between sources of renewable electricity, which would power the mining computers. Envion said people who bought its new tokens would have a right to a share of the new Bitcoins mined. The founders of the company, about half a dozen programmers and marketers, set it up in Switzerland, and said they were compliant with all the necessary regulations. In one of its many promotional posts on Medium, the  Envion team wrote: “As financial regulators across the globe look to regulate I.C.O.s and protect investors, Envion serves as a model for a compliant crowdsale that operates with the same transparency and integrity of traditional financial markets.” A current spokesman for the founders, Laurent Martin, said problems had begun even before the project started fund-raising late last year because of the chief executive the founders brought in, Matthias Woestmann. According to Mr. Martin, the founders gave Mr. Woestmann what they thought was temporary control of their shares in the company. Mr. Woestmann later refused to give them back, and then diluted the shares of the other owners, providing him with control of the money that was raised. Mr. Martin said the problems that had come up since then were not caused by the I.C.O. structure. Instead, he said, they are a result of Mr. Woestmann’s tactics and his refusal to give back ownership of the company. “Envion did something truly unique in the way they protected investors,” Mr. Martin said. “It’s unfortunate that each of these bulwarks is being tested.” In an interview, Mr. Woestmann said he had taken control of the company because the founders created extra Envion tokens to enrich themselves — a claim the founders deny. He has recently made efforts to sell the company to new owners. Most of the investors on Envion’s channel on the messaging service Telegram have sided with the founders against Mr. Woestmann, who they say should either begin building the product that was promised or refund investors. But large Envion investors who have organized a group online say they distrust the founders as well. They note that the founders are now led by a man named Michael Luckow, who was never mentioned during the fund-raising process. They complain that the founders let investors buy tokens without providing any information about the turmoil behind the scenes. The investors have also turned up evidence that some of the founders sold their own tokens before the current mess spilled into the public. “As an investor, this is a horrible situation to be in, as in my point of view both parties are to blame,” said Peter Kozak, a 47-year-old in Switzerland who put $55,000 into Envion. “So many questions and no answers.” Mr. Martin said that the tokens had been sold to pay Envion expenses and that Mr. Luckow simply hadn’t wanted to take on a more public role early on. It is still possible that investors will get at least some of their money back. Mr. Woestmann said he still had control of most of the money in the bank, with the founders controlling another chunk. But he said the funds added up to only $50 million at this point, not the $100 million that the founders had claimed. Mr. Woestmann said the founders hadn’t raised as much money as they claimed. And the declining price of virtual currencies has dropped the value of the various digital tokens Envion is holding. Jessica Smith, a 21-year-old in England, said she had put $28,000 into Envion — almost all of the money she had made over the last two years of trading cryptocurrencies nearly full time. She said she was now looking for new work. “This has been very painful,” she said.",-0.0003396825396825384,0.051325146781496

351,Why A.I. and Cryptocurrency Are Making One Type of Computer Chip Scarce,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/technology/gpu-chip-shortage.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-08T16:38:31+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Two technology booms — some people might call them frenzies — are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity. Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin. With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers. “The chips are simply going out of stock,” said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft’s research lab in Beijing in 2014. “And the problem is getting worse.” Malong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip. When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier. “We need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,” Mr. Scott said. “There is a tangible impact to our research work.” But he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. “We have never had this problem before,” he said. “It was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.” G.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips. Like Malong, those companies build what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Large numbers of G.P.U.s, which consume relatively little electrical power and can be packed into a small space, can process the huge amounts of math required by neural networks more efficiently than standard chips. Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining. Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards — flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers — worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades. That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners — not to mention gamers — has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day. “It is a tough moment,” said Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer. “We could do more if we had more of these” chips in data centers. “There are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.” AMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company’s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia’s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough. This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I. Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices. “You want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,” said Mr. Scott of Microsoft. The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year. Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia’s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing. Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless. Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow. Mr. Zeiler said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures. “The demand,” he said, “is definitely crazy.”",0.0722123076923077,0.04019744699744699
352,Bitcoin Sees Wall Street Warm to Trading Virtual Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-08T00:21:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to Bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential. The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit — most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank. The moves by Goldman and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment. The new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of Bitcoin. The virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn’t be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations. But instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions — without any financial institutions getting involved — it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver. Details of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment. Many corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that Bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain. Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade. ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project. The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do. The chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling Bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns. Bitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said Bitcoin was “probably rat poison squared” in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying he’d “short” Bitcoin if he could. And the new efforts to trade Bitcoin don’t help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce haven’t gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity like gold or silver. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated Bitcoin exchange that would compete with Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large Bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions. “The reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,” Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. “We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoin’s strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.” Goldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoin’s price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins. Intercontinental Exchange’s effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms. Several big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved. LedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into it. The interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved. Regulators are currently looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way Bitcoin was created and structured — without any one company or organization behind it — it would be on safer ground with regulators. ICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said. Mr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved. “The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin’s history,” he said. “I’ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It’s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions — I think we’re finally there.”",0.134866,0.09437727272727273
353,Should the Fed Create ‘FedCoin’ to Rival Bitcoin? A Former Top Official Says ‘Maybe’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/upshot/should-the-fed-create-fedcoin-to-rival-bitcoin-a-former-top-official-says-maybe.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-04T17:36:32+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Many enthusiasts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are motivated by deep skepticism of the central banks that control the world’s money supply. But what if central banks themselves entered the game? What would happen if the Federal Reserve, or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan used blockchain technology to create their own virtual currencies? Besides, that is, having some cryptocurrency fans’ heads explode? A former Fed governor — who was also a finalist to lead the central bank — thinks the idea deserves serious consideration. “Most central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and it’s kind of cool, or risky,” given the potential investor losses and widespread fraud, said Kevin Warsh, who was a governor at the Fed from 2006 to 2011 and was a top contender to become its chairman late last year when President Trump instead appointed Jerome Powell. If he had returned to the Fed, Mr. Warsh said, he would have appointed a team “to think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.” “Not that it would supplant and replace cash,” he said, “but it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.” He added that blockchain technology, which allows reliable, decentralized record keeping of transactions, could be useful in the payment systems operated by the Fed, which enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks. “It strikes me that a central bank digital currency might have a role to play there,” Mr. Warsh, who is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, told several reporters Thursday evening. Some central banks are already doing work in this vein, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England. And Mr. Powell acknowledged the potential applications in his confirmation hearing for the Fed chairmanship in November, saying, “We actually look at blockchain as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.” It would be quite a twist if a technology whose most ardent fans are motivated by distrust of central banks became a key tool for those banks.  But it would address some of the concerns connected to Bitcoin and its many privately created rivals. To the degree that the value of existing cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, they are ill-suited as a medium of exchange. Central banks have spent hundreds of years learning how to keep the value of money stable. And to the degree Bitcoin and the like facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and fraud, they will be a target of global law enforcement. Central banks are used to building systems that allow enforcement of those laws. It’s clear that central banks weighing use of blockchain technology don’t share the more anarchist impulses of some of the most die-hard cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But there may be more commonality than it might seem. As Mr. Warsh argues, if people really do believe that digital currencies in some form are the future of money, it would behoove central banks to treat them as more than a novelty. “Congress gave the Fed a monopoly over money,” Mr. Warsh said. “And if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold — and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account — as a purely defensive matter I wouldn’t want somebody to take that monopoly from me.” In other words, if cryptocurrency enthusiasts are correct that this technology could become a better way of carrying out even routine transactions, the Fed and its counterparts are the institutions that have the most to lose.",0.23950454545454544,0.09189829846079846
354,He Fled a Prison in Iceland. Now It’s Good to Be Back.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/business/iceland-bitcoin-heist.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-04T09:00:03+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland — It has been more than four months since thieves pulled off the biggest heist in the history of Iceland, and the police here still have no idea where the booty — roughly $2 million worth of Bitcoin-mining computers — is stashed. A breakthrough in the case seemed imminent in early February when the authorities detained Sindri Stefansson, a 31-year-old man with a rap sheet that includes drug possession and burglary. Even though he hadn’t been charged, let alone convicted, the media tagged him the “mastermind” of the crime, largely because he was held in prison longer than any of the 11 suspects who were questioned. Then, like the computers, Mr. Stefansson disappeared. For the next five days he was an international fugitive. After escaping from the prison — a feat that took surprisingly little effort, given the institution’s bare-minimum approach to security — he hopped a taxi to the country’s largest airport, where he boarded an early-morning flight to Stockholm. In a twist that seems borrowed from a cheesy caper film, the plane also carried Katrin Jakobsdottir, the prime minister of Iceland. “We did not chat,” Mr. Stefansson said, calling from a prison near Amsterdam in his first interview since he was arrested two weeks ago in the Netherlands. Speaking by phone in a gloomy monotone, he said he had worn a baseball cap and avoided the gaze of everyone on the plane. “I kept my head down as much as I could.” After the recent rash of cryptocurrency-related crimes, many of them gunpoint stickups of people forced to empty their virtual wallets, a theft like this seemed all but inevitable. And Iceland is one of the world’s premier venues for mining operators, who are drawn to the country’s cheap electricity and chilly weather, which helps keep computers cool. Mr. Stefansson would not discuss what the media has named the Big Bitcoin Heist. Instead, he focused on his regret for having fled, a decision that, he said, he rued as soon as he landed in Sweden and realized that his mug shot was all over the media. “I did not eat and had a constant knot in the pit of my stomach,” he said. “I was disappointed in myself for making my family suffer, and nervous about being recognized.” Detectives in Reykjavik would like to have a conversation of their own with Mr. Stefansson, and they will get the opportunity now that he has returned to Iceland, having been extradited on Friday. He returned to a country riveted by his case. Calls have poured into a tip line with theories about where the computers are stored and, until recently, where Mr. Stefansson may be found. “I can tell you the Icelandic public has been very interested,” Olafur Kjartansson, the lead police investigator, said in an interview. “I’m sitting in the public hot baths and friends and colleagues will say to me, ‘Did you find him?”’ The theft suggests that security at some of Iceland’s Bitcoin mining operations has yet to catch up to the value of the commodity, now trading at around $9,600 apiece. If the warehouse that was robbed were digging for gold instead of running an algorithm in a quest for cryptocurrency, odds are that the crime would have been far trickier to pull off. Then again, this is Iceland, a place that seems to presume its citizens will abide by the law. An astonishing amount of social trust is embedded in society, a phenomenon that is especially evident when looking at the country’s penal system. Mr. Stefansson had been kept at Sogn, which is known as an open prison. Inmates live in their own rooms, which have flat-screen TVs, and talk on their own cellphones. During the day, inmates earn the equivalent of $4 an hour cooking, cleaning and maintaining a chicken coop. “It’s a friendly atmosphere,” said Gudmundur Thoroddsson, a prisoner advocate who was recently released from Sogn. “There’s a good relationship with the guards. Never any fighting or arguing.” The prison is at the foot of a treeless hill and looks more like a rural two-story home than a penitentiary. During a recent visit, the entrance road was blocked by the sort of gate used by pay-by-the-hour parking garages. The property, which includes a soccer field, is surrounded by wire fencing a few feet high. Mr. Stefansson wouldn’t have needed a running start to jump it. The night he bolted, he started browsing for international flights on his cellphone at about 11, he said in the interview. After booking one under an assumed name, he opened his window and left. He claims that he walked a mile to Route 1, the road that rings the island, and hitchhiked 59 miles to Keflavik, a town near the airport. (The police maintain that an accomplice drove him.) From there, he called a cab. Once in Stockholm, he traveled via train, taxi and ferry to Germany through Denmark. There he met “individuals” who drove him to Amsterdam. He enjoyed just three hours of freedom in the Dutch capital. Unbeknown to him, the local authorities had been quickly tipped off by two pedestrians with a cellphone photograph of a person they believed was the much-publicized wanted man. Soon after, an officer approached Mr. Stefansson and demanded identification. “I was just walking when it happened,” he said. The police in Iceland have said little about any evidence they have linking Mr. Stefansson to the computer theft. It was actually three separate thefts over the course of a few weeks, starting Dec. 5. One occurred at a compound near the airport, home to a handful of cryptocurrency mining warehouses leased to different companies. The warehouses look like hangars, though instead of containing jets these are densely packed with computers, numbered and neatly arranged on shelves. Giant fans hum noisily overhead. “If you spent a day here, you would probably go deaf,” shouted Mia Molnar of Genesis Mining, which is based in Hong Kong and mines coins for Ethereum, a Bitcoin rival. She was giving a tour of Genesis’ warehouse and later, in a far quieter room, offered her best shot at explaining what all those computers are doing. The simplified version: They are engaged in a nonstop, worldwide race to process new transactions using cryptocurrencies, digital tokens that can be traded electronically. The task requires ever more powerful equipment. Success is rewarded, digitally and automatically, with a small batch of new coins. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been viewed warily by some governments and criticized by environmentalists for hoovering up vast and increasing amounts of electricity. Genesis and its competitors, on the other hand, see a financial opportunity, one that has sent the value of their mining equipment soaring. “I think a lot of companies have been more worried about hacks,” Ms. Molnar said. “Less about the hardware.” The warehouse adjacent to Genesis’ is the one that was robbed. The lessee of that building, which appears to be under construction, has not been publicly identified. Through the police, the company has offered $60,000 to anyone who leads detectives to the stolen property. At the same time, the police have been searching for the machines by studying the electrical grid for surges in use. They have also followed up on ideas provided by the public, including one from a psychic. So far, said Mr. Kjartansson, the police investigator, the search has been fruitless. His hunch, based on the sophistication of the theft, is that the perpetrators worked with an overseas syndicate of organized crime. Nothing in Mr. Stefansson’s long record indicates international links of any kind. He has been convicted of possessing drugs and driving under the influence, and the grandest of his larcenies is the $2,000 he stole from slot machines in a Reykjavik bar. He said in the interview that he had been sober for more than seven years and made apps and websites for a living. He minimized a recent arrest for growing marijuana as a “side business.” When he was arrested for the Bitcoin robbery, Mr. Stefansson said, he was two days away from restarting his life and moving to Spain with his wife and three children. If Mr. Stefansson is ultimately charged with any heist-related crimes, his prison break won’t be one of them. In Iceland, it is not against the law to escape from prison. “Our system supposes that a person who has been deprived of his freedom will try to regain it,” said Jon Gunnlaugsson, a former judge on Iceland’s Supreme Court. “It’s the responsibility of prison authorities to keep him there.” Further, it is unclear whether the police had the right to continue holding Mr. Stefansson in prison in the first place. He was not under arrest at the time, because a judge’s order to keep him in custody had expired hours before his escape. In advance of a hearing to extend the custody order, the police persuaded Mr. Stefansson to sign a document agreeing to stay in prison voluntarily. He immediately decided the agreement was bogus. In an open letter published in an Icelandic daily while he was on the lam, he wrote that given the circumstances, he was genuinely surprised to find himself the subject of a manhunt. Paradoxically, returning to the very place he was so eager to leave became one of Mr. Stefansson’s primary goals. At the prison near Amsterdam, he said, he was just a name and number, underfed and wary of his fellow inmates. By comparison, he said, “Icelandic prisons are a hotel.”",-0.004758510638297871,0.04698527831506556
355,Goldman Sachs to Open a Bitcoin Trading Operation,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/technology/bitcoin-goldman-sachs.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-05-02T21:07:22+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Most big banks have tried to stay far away from the scandal-tainted virtual currency Bitcoin. But Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank. In a step that is likely to lend legitimacy to virtual currencies — and create new concerns for Goldman — the bank is about to begin using its own money to trade with clients in a variety of contracts linked to the price of Bitcoin. While Goldman will not initially be buying and selling actual Bitcoins, a team at the bank is looking at going in that direction if it can get regulatory approval and figure out how to deal with the additional risks associated with holding the virtual currency. Rana Yared, one of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, said the bank was cleareyed about what it was getting itself into. “I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,” Ms. Yared said. “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.” Still, the suggestion that Goldman Sachs, among the most vaunted banks on Wall Street and a frequent target for criticism, would even consider trading Bitcoin would have been viewed as preposterous a few years ago, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a way to buy drugs online. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous figure going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who talked about replacing Wall Street banks — not giving them a new revenue line. Over the last two years, however, a growing number of hedge funds and other large investors around the world have expressed an interest in virtual currencies. Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December. But until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble. Ms. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be “mined” in a complex, virtual system. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she said. Ms. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn’t know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman’s board of directors. The step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation. Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged — and recovered significantly — as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies. “It is not a new risk that we don’t understand,” Ms. Yared said. “It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.” Goldman has already been doing more than most banks in the area, clearing trades for customers who want to buy and sell Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In the next few weeks — the exact start date has not been set — Goldman will begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of clients. It will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients. The bank’s first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, joined Goldman two weeks ago to handle the day-to-day operations, a hiring that was first reported by Tearsheet. In his last job, Mr. Schmidt, 38, was an electronic trader at the hedge fund Seven Eight Capital. In 2017, he left that job to trade virtual currencies on his own. He will initially be placed on Goldman’s foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said. Mr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin — or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called — if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities. The firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards. Goldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets. Since the crisis, Goldman has made a big push to position itself as the most technologically sophisticated firm on Wall Street. Among other things, it has started an online lending service, known as Marcus, that has brought the firm into contact with retail customers for the first time. The virtual currency trading, though, will be available only to big institutional investors. Mr. Schmidt said Goldman’s sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world. “In terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading — but it didn’t exist,” he said.",0.05315,0.0956316889129389
356,"Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/technology/blockchain-iso-russian-spies.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-04-29T20:19:24+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles. Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B. They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards. “Look, the internet belongs to the Americans — but blockchain will belong to us,” he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country’s four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B. Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: “The internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians.” Both of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment. The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain — a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting — and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles. The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack. The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more. Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants. “It is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,” said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. “To get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically.” The original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data. There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations — and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But in countries like the United States, China, Russia, Singapore and Switzerland, government groups have talked about using blockchains for myriad tasks, like issuing national currency or tracking identity records for citizens and visitors. Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes. Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group. Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity. “In the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,” said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. “If something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale — and won’t be questioned on the way in.” Ms. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries. The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting — first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations. “There has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,” said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee. Few countries have made their interest in the blockchain as clear as Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin met briefly last year with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the second most widely used blockchain-based virtual currency platform after Bitcoin. Mr. Putin also put the blockchain at the center of his “Digital Economy” program for Russia, and his government has talked about creating a crypto-ruble, similar to Bitcoin. One of the Russian delegates to the I.S.O. blockchain group, Maxim Shevchenko, gave a talk last summer in Russia in which he spoke about the country’s goals in the I.S.O. group. The bullet points on the slide included “possibility to influence the technology” and “implementation Russian standards and solutions worldwide.” Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B. Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains. At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants. The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology. At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France. Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology. “It will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,” he said. “We all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.”",0.16008955223880594,0.054426972281449895
357,A Former Top Wall Street Regulator Turns to the Blockchain,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/technology/gensler-mit-blockchain.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-04-22T21:45:42+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Gary Gensler was one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration, the finance chief for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and, before both of those jobs, a partner at Goldman Sachs. Now, like many other big names from business and government, he is plunging into the world of the blockchain, the data-tracking technology introduced by Bitcoin. Mr. Gensler, 60, has recently gone to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he will write and teach about the potential he sees for blockchains to change the financial world. He will also use his position to warn about how many of the current projects in the world of virtual currencies, including some of the biggest, are likely to face a significant moment of reckoning with regulators. Mr. Gensler is set to say in a speech at M.I.T. on Monday that the second and third most widely used virtual currencies, Ether and Ripple, have most likely been issued and traded in violation of American securities regulations. “There is a strong case for both of them — but particularly Ripple — that they are noncompliant securities,” he said in an interview. He believes Bitcoin, the original virtual currency, can remain exempt from securities regulations. Mr. Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the agency that Mr. Gensler led from 2009 to 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are in the middle of determining how to categorize and crack down on many of the virtual currencies created in recent years. Most of the focus has been on smaller currencies that were issued through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, a method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies. But Mr. Gensler believes that better-known virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities, given the way they have been created and sold. “2018 is going to be a very interesting time,” Mr. Gensler said. “Over 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings, and over 100 exchanges that offer I.C.O.s, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with U.S. securities law.” The people behind both Ether and Ripple have argued that their tokens are not securities. But there are signs that the S.E.C. could be receptive to Mr. Gensler’s argument. Regulators have indicated in private meetings with industry participants that they are considering whether Ether should be categorized as a security. All the outstanding Ether were worth around $65 billion at Sunday’s price, while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around $35 billion. If they are deemed to be securities, it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded. That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their prices. Mr. Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Before he got into office, some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks. But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisis. Joi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, said the combination of Mr. Gensler’s record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to M.I.T. Mr. Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who don’t have a financial interest in them, though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin software. “It’s important that you have a core group of people who aren’t in it for the money, and who care about the proper architecture for the long run,” he said. Mr. Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fall. The original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is needed. While most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Mr. Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry. For now, though, his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulated. Most industry experts, including Mr. Gensler, assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization, and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers. Some other virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs. But Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation. Ether could get off the hook, Mr. Gensler said, because its development has been more decentralized recently, and new Ether tokens are now given out to so-called miners through a network. Aya Miyaguchi, the head of the Ethereum Foundation, said in an email that the foundation “neither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether, and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds (under 1 percent of all Ether) is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participants.” But Mr. Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token, known as XRP, to avoid being categorized as a security. The company that oversees Ripple’s development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable, he said. A spokesman for the company Ripple, Tom Channick, said XRP should not be a security. “XRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple, and they are not paid dividends,” he said. “XRP exists independent of Ripple, was created before the company and will exist after it.” Mr. Gensler, who has no virtual currency investments, said he was not tied to any coin’s winning the race. But he does think changes are necessary before blockchains can go mainstream. “I would be surprised if 10 years from now this isn’t somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way,” he said. “But so much of the stuff that is being promoted now will not be around.”",0.13812857142857143,0.12730100036647654
358,Venture Capitalists Seek ‘Safe Harbor’ for Virtual Currencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/technology/virtual-currency-securities.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-04-19T22:45:47+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have been lobbying federal regulators to protect at least some virtual currencies from being categorized as securities, a designation that would carry significantly more oversight. The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz helped assemble a group of investors and lawyers that met with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late March. They also proposed a “safe harbor” for some virtual currencies, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by The New York Times and three people briefed on the effort who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the proceedings were confidential. Regulators have indicated in private meetings that they are considering whether virtual currencies — including Ether, the second most widely used digital token — should be categorized as a security, according to three people who have been in the meetings. That designation could cause a significant drop in the value of Ether. “It’s a ‘come to the lord’ moment,” said Richard Levin, a lawyer at the firm Polsinelli who works with companies in the space. “We are seeing a watershed moment in which many firms in the digital asset community who may have been ignorant of the law — or poorly informed — are now coming to terms with the fact that they are subject to regulators.” The group led by Andreessen Horowitz called themselves the “Venture Capital Working Group,” according to the proposal, dated March 26. The group included the two largest venture capital firms in the virtual currency industry, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. It also included lawyers from Cooley, Perkins Coie, and McDermott Will & Emery, the people involved in the effort said. The group met with the S.E.C. in Washington on March 28 to present their idea for a safe harbor that would allow some tokens to be categorized as “utility tokens” rather than securities. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on the meeting. Thousands of virtual currencies have been created through so-called initial coin offerings in which entrepreneurs sold digital tokens to raise money for their projects. The tokens are generally intended to serve as internal payment methods in software that the entrepreneurs are building. Over the past year, entrepreneurs have raised more than $6 billion through initial coin offerings. These coins mostly trade on unregulated virtual currency exchanges. Many entrepreneurs have said that because their tokens have a utility, as a payment method, they should not be considered investment contracts or securities. But Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has said in recent months that he believes almost every token issued through an initial coin offering should be registered as a security — almost none are today. The S.E.C. has sent subpoenas to dozens of people and companies in the virtual currency industry asking for information about how various digital tokens were issued and marketed to investors. When investments are securities, they generally need to have paperwork filed with regulators and can only be traded on regulated exchanges, like those where stocks and commodities are bought and sold. No regulated securities exchanges offer virtual currency trading. Most investors assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or central organization. New Bitcoins are distributed on a daily basis to computers helping to maintain the network. Some large virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs. But Ethereum, the virtual currency network that houses the Ether virtual currency, did raise money by selling Ether tokens to investors through what was then called a pre-sale and is now often called an initial coin offering. The Ethereum Foundation took in Bitcoin that were worth around $18 million at the time. Ether are now distributed in a manner similar to that of Bitcoin. The group pulled together by Andreessen Horowitz said in its proposal that Ether “has become so decentralized it should not be deemed a security.” The proposal suggests that digital tokens should generally be exempt from securities laws if they achieve “full decentralization” or “full functionality.” It adds that full decentralization could occur under several conditions, including “when the token creator no longer has control of the network based on its ability to make unilateral changes to the functionality of the tokens.” The proposal says a token is fully functional when it can be used for its intended purpose on a computer network and is not just useful as a speculative investment, which is the case with many tokens today. The group notes that these definitions are only suggestions, but the “proposed safe harbor has been vetted by, and has the support of, many of the key players in the industry.” People briefed on the meeting said that regulators did not immediately embrace the safe harbor proposal. Many entrepreneurs and law firms have been creating new ways for virtual currency projects to issue their tokens as securities and some exchanges have talked about getting registered as official securities exchanges. It is still unclear what will happen to tokens that did not register as securities but are later categorized as securities.",0.2047121212121212,0.09701244042153133
359,Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin Failed,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/cryptocurrency-facebook-telegram.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-02-28,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Some of the world’s biggest internet messaging companies are hoping to succeed where cryptocurrency start-ups have failed by introducing mainstream consumers to the alternative world of digital coins. The internet outfits, including Facebook, Telegram and Signal, are planning to roll out new cryptocurrencies over the next year that are meant to allow users to send money to contacts on their messaging systems, like a Venmo or PayPal that can move across international borders. The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations. Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. A coin is in the works that will work with Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line. The messaging companies have a reach that dwarfs the backers of earlier cryptocurrencies. Facebook and Telegram can make the digital wallets used for cryptocurrencies available, in an instant, to hundreds of millions of users. All of the new projects are going after a market that has already proved popular with consumers. Venmo has taken off in the United States by making it easier to send payments by phone. And in China, many consumers use the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular WeChat messaging system. “It’s pretty much the most fascinating thing happening in crypto right now,” said Eric Meltzer, a co-founder of a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm, Primitive Ventures. “They each have their own advantage in this battle, and it will be insane to watch it go down.” In a statement, Facebook did not directly address its work on a digital coin. The other companies declined to comment on their projects. Most of them appear to be working on digital coins that could exist on a decentralized network of computers, independent to some degree of the companies that created them. Like Bitcoin, the new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries, particularly in the developing world where it is hard for ordinary people to open bank accounts and buy things online. The current designs being discussed generally do away with the energy-guzzling mining process that Bitcoin relies on. But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream. The lack of a central authority over cryptocurrencies — a government or a bank — has made them useful to criminals and scammers, and the designs of the computer networks that manage them make it hard to handle significant numbers of transactions. “They are all going to run up against these same types of technological limits,” said Richard Ma, the chief executive of Quantstamp, a firm that provides security audits for new cryptocurrencies. The companies are throwing significant resources into their projects, even as the prices of cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last year. Facebook has more than 50 engineers working on its project, three people familiar with the effort said. An industry website, The Block, has been keeping track of the steady flow of new job listings for the Facebook project. The Facebook effort, which is being run by a former president of PayPal, David Marcus, started last year after Telegram raised an eye-popping $1.7 billion to fund its cryptocurrency project. Facebook has been coy about what it is building. The team is in an office with separate key-card access so other Facebook employees cannot get in, according to two Facebook employees. Facebook is looking at several ways to use the blockchain, the technology introduced by Bitcoin that makes it possible to keep shared records of financial transactions on several computers, rather than relying on one big central player like PayPal or Visa. The five people who have been briefed on the Facebook team’s work said the company’s most immediate product was likely to be a coin that would be pegged to the value of traditional currencies, as Bloomberg first reported. A digital token with a stable value would not be attractive to speculators — the main audience for cryptocurrencies so far — but it would allow consumers to hold it and pay for things without worrying about the value of the coin rising and falling. Several other companies have recently introduced so-called stablecoins, linked to the value of the dollar. JPMorgan Chase even said it was experimenting with the concept last month. Facebook is looking at pegging the value of its coin to a basket of different foreign currencies, rather than just the dollar, three people briefed on the plans said. Facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars, euros and other national currencies held in Facebook bank accounts. The company is overhauling its messaging infrastructure, which would connect three of its properties — Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. That integration, which could take more than a year, would extend the reach of Facebook’s digital currency across the 2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month. The big question facing Facebook is how much control it would retain over the digital coin. If Facebook is responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user, it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system, rather than a traditional, centralized system like PayPal. Working with cryptocurrency exchanges would take at least some of the regulatory burden off Facebook, since the exchanges would be responsible for holding the digital coins and vetting customers. But if Facebook goes with a coin it does not entirely control, it will be harder for the company to make money from transaction fees and easier for criminals to use the coin for illegal purposes. Facebook employees have told the exchanges that they are hoping to get a product out in the first half of the year. The coins from the other messaging companies are likely to look more like traditional cryptocurrencies, with fluctuating values and a decentralized design that would give users more control. Telegram, which was started by a team of Russian exiles, has prided itself on thumbing its nose at governments. This could help Telegram in places like Iran and Russia, where people — especially dissidents — have difficulty using the traditional financial system. Telegram sent a letter to its investors last month saying that it was 90 percent done with the key components of the network that would house the Gram, the name for its digital token. The company has told investors that it hopes to have some version of the system out in the next few months, according to two investors who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. Another team is building a digital token, Mobilecoin, designed to work inside the privacy-focused messaging application Signal. The project raised $30 million last year and is trying to raise another $30 million, according to three people briefed on the effort. While the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, is advising the effort, it is being run independently of Signal. The project is a favorite of many longtime cryptocurrency advocates because of strong privacy controls. But Mobilecoin, like the other projects underway, will still have to solve the problems that have stopped all the other cryptocurrencies from living up to expectations. “The jury is still out” on their effectiveness, Mr. Ma of Quantstamp said.",0.18338148148148148,0.07199995991662657
360,Tech Thinks It Has a Fix for the Problems It Created: Blockchain,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/technology/blockchain-uses.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-04-01T22:54:42+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Worried about someone hacking the next election? Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information? The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain — even for the problems the industry helped to create. The first blockchain was created in 2009 as a new kind of database for the virtual currency Bitcoin, where all transactions could be stored without any banks or governments involved. Now, countless entrepreneurs, companies and governments are looking to use similar databases — often independent of Bitcoin — to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society. “People feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data,” said Ryan Shea, a co-founder of Blockstack, a New York company working with blockchain technology. The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has said the blockchain could help reduce the big internet companies’ influence and return the web to his original vision. But he has also warned that it could come with some of the same problems as the web. Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority. In theory, this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked. Investors, for one, see potential. While the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have plummeted this year, investment in other blockchain projects has remained strong. In the first three months of 2018, venture capitalists put half a billion dollars into 75 blockchain projects, more than double what they raised in the last quarter of 2017, according to data from Pitchbook. Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing, and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting. But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things, like the way we vote and the way we interact online. “There is just so much it can do,” said Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects. “I love the fact that you can transmit data, information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack — really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient.” Mr. Tusk, the founder of Tusk Strategies, is an investor in some large virtual currency companies. He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain-based systems. Mr. Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper-proof way. “Everything is moving toward people saying, ‘I want all the benefits of the internet, but I want to protect my privacy and my security,’” he said. “The only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain.” Blockchains assemble data into so-called blocks that are chained together using complicated math. Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps, any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions. The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain — and most of its imitators — are kept by a peer-to-peer computer network. The novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard, abuse or lose control of the data, as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax. A range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model — for projects from the prosaic to the radical. Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people. Coca-Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor. These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados, who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old-fashioned databases. Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry: a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested. “The blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say, ‘Yes, we are the solution,’ and they have every incentive to do so,” said Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. “But somebody needs to ask the question: ‘Is it actually better? Is it measurably better?’” Many blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. These fund-raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight. But new blockchain efforts continue apace, motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube. Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements. This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data — as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles. And start-ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands. Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it. The animating force behind the project is that users — rather than Blockstack or any other company — would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service. Blockstack is one of several blockchain-based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don’t rely on having unfettered access to our personal information. The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke, Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain-based alternatives. “As Facebook is collapsing we need to replace it with a blockchain based, decentralized platform!” one user, @GerdMoeBehrens, wrote. “#blockchain WE NEED U NOW!!!” wrote another, @andymartin46. But Mr. Berners-Lee has warned that the development of the blockchain could come with unintended consequences, like more activity from criminals operating outside the oversight of governments. Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand, when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop. In fact, most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy. For example, the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data — details of the transactions between users — to be seen by anyone, even if other data — the users’ identities — remains obscured. Voting start-ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain, but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns. Blockchain-based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys, which people are famously bad at doing. With Bitcoin, when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account — if someone lost the private key to a blockchain-based online account, they could lose access to their identity. “We’re not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems,” said Michael Casey, a co-author of “The Truth Machine,” a new book on the blockchain. “What’s important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face.”",0.05560185185185186,0.08175197744642189
361,Think Cryptocurrency Is Confusing? Try Paying Taxes on It,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/think-cryptocurrency-is-confusing-try-paying-taxes-on-it.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-03-21T15:36:16+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren’t nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets. No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how — and whether — to pay them. With this year’s April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaching, many virtual currency traders are sweating over their tax returns. They’re confused by the complicated rules, many of them stemming from guidelines issued by the I.R.S. in 2014, governing the taxation of virtual currencies. They’re afraid that the windfall profits created by last year’s cryptocurrency boom, which sent currencies like Bitcoin and Ether skyrocketing and created a new class of crypto-millionaires, have left them with huge tax bills. And, of course, they’re worried about drawing the eye of the Internal Revenue Service. “I’ve lost sleep over it,” said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year’s cryptocurrency profits on his taxes. Shaun, who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past, said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the I.R.S. to pay special attention to cases like his. “I don’t want to be made an example of,” he said. This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation. For an hour, the audience peppered them with tax-prep questions that ranged from common (Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I haven’t sold yet?) to esoteric (If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen, can I deduct my losses?). By the end of the hour, there seemed to be many more questions than answers. “It’s complicated as heck,” said Mike Schreibman, an I.T. consultant who attended. Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis. “Nobody knows what’s going to happen,” said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. “But the I.R.S. is the one agency you don’t want to mess with.” Taxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into “privacy coins,” such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users’ transactions. Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology’s stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it’s possible for users to conceal their identities. Until recently, the I.R.S. showed little desire to go after cryptocurrency income, since there was so little of it. But last year’s boom changed all that. The agency has formed a team of specialists to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes, including international money laundering and tax evasion. In November, after a yearlong lawsuit, the agency won a judgment that forced Coinbase, the largest American-based cryptocurrency exchange, to turn over account records for more than 14,000 customers. In January, Coinbase sent 1099-K forms to a number of its current users, informing them that their trading proceeds were being reported to the I.R.S. and reminding them to pay the taxes they owed. All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon. Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business. “We’re preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,” Mr. Costanz said. Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year. “A lot of crypto investors are younger and don’t have a lot of experience trading stocks,” she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, “a lot of people are kind of shocked.” Part of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else — whether you’re cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee — you’re creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for. Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year’s cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year’s market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year’s gains. Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. “Now they’re stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don’t have the capital to pay it.” Faced with such problems, some cryptocurrency traders have decided to avoid the issue entirely, by not declaring any cryptocurrency on their taxes and hoping for the best. According to Credit Karma, which provides tax-filing services, fewer than 100 of the 250,000 people who had used the company’s tax-filing software as of February reported cryptocurrency transactions, a rate below 0.04 percent. Even the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren’t planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains. “This is the smallest crypto event I’ve been to,” said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. “No one believes they’ll get in trouble.” All the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one. Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year’s tax season had come as a jolt of reality. “It’s not Monopoly money anymore,” he said.",0.049184848484848484,0.04350693077965806
362,"Is Bitcoin a Waste of Electricity, or Something Worse?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/economy/bitcoin-electricity-productivity.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-03-01T00:17:22+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"WASHINGTON — A manufacturing start-up recently announced plans to move into a shuttered aluminum factory in upstate New York, taking advantage of abundant cheap electricity from the St. Lawrence River. Instead of smelting aluminum, however, the company plans to turn that power into Bitcoins. Money is supposed to be a means of buying things. Now, the nation’s hottest investment is buying money. And the investment rush is raising questions about whether one reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years is that the nation is busy distracting itself. While Bitcoin mining may not be labor intensive, it diverts time, energy and capital from other, more productive activities that economists say could fuel faster growth. “It appears that much of our evolving digital infrastructure is devoted to activities, like the proliferation of cybercoins, that are worse than frivolous,” said James McAndrews, the former head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By a wide range of measures, America has a productivity problem. The economy is growing slowly, and almost 20 percent of adults in their prime working years are neither working nor trying to find work. Americans who do have jobs are less likely to start their own companies. Even the most basic kind of production is in decline. Americans are having less sex and making fewer babies. Some economists see evidence that people are playing video games instead of going to work, logging on instead of getting it on, and plowing a growing share of their time, capital and natural resources into virtual products like social media, games and the latest fad: virtual currencies. Bitcoin, the largest virtual currency, is a particularly voracious consumer of resources because new Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity. Bitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550. Believers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions. But Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth. “Once the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,” he said. Colin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes. Mr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city’s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost. Mr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city’s supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city’s power, but it employs about 200 people. The mining companies? “They hire a security guard,” he said. “And a guy who comes when something breaks.” David Bowman, who describes himself as Plattsburgh’s first Bitcoin miner — “I started a long time ago, around 2014,” he said — started with a handful of computers. Now he has 20 machines. A few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building. Mr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor’s concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school. And he doesn’t see that Plattsburgh has better options. “The place needs all the jobs they can get,” he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee. Other governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns. “Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,” the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement. Some Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world’s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies. Some American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs. “They’re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,” said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy. And plenty of places are hungry for jobs — even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings. Massena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory. The New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building. The company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none. “The plan is to get anybody here that you can,” said Steven D. O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor. “I have said all along, I’ll take whatever I can.”",0.11834637681159421,0.04582458905828471
363,Women in Cryptocurrencies Push Back Against ‘Blockchain Bros’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/cryptocurrency-women-blockchain-bros.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-25T23:19:05+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"PALO ALTO, Calif. — When a cryptocurrency start-up that promised to revolutionize the fruit and vegetable industry shut down last month, it left behind one word on its website: penis. When a virtual currency company called DateCoin recently tried to entice investors for its initial coin offering, it posted a Facebook ad that featured a reclining woman in a swimsuit with text over her body that read, “Touch my I.C.O.” And after the North American Bitcoin Conference in January, which highlighted 84 male speakers and three women, the official conference party was held at a Miami strip club. Virtual currencies and blockchain, the digital ledger that forms the basis of the cryptocurrencies, were intended to be democratizing and equalizing forces, buoyed by a utopian exuberance. But women who have been trying to participate in the gold rush are finding a lopsided gender divide. And some say the culture is getting worse, with the male-dominated culture buoyed by a new fleet of wealthy crypto speculators known as “blockchain bros.” That means the budding world is already in danger of looking like the rest of the technology industry, where women are decidedly a minority. Some studies estimate that women account for only 4 percent to 6 percent of blockchain investors. That imbalance matters because the early days of an industry are often when the fortunes are made — and those big winners then choose whom to invest in and what to build next, launching a cascade of consequences. Now, some early female investors and entrepreneurs are beginning to sound the alarm and push back. “Women, consider crypto,” Alexia Bonatsos, a venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter. “Otherwise the men are going to get all the wealth, again.” Some crypto leaders are now organizing events, clubs and conferences to attract women to the industry. Ms. Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco. And Jalak Jobanputra, founder of the start-up investment firm Future Perfect Ventures, and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue. They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitment. “The early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions,” Ms. Jobanputra said. She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded next. Arianna Simpson, an early cryptocurrency investor, said the surge of interest in virtual currencies from male novices should remind women that it did not take expertise or a Ph.D. to thrive in the ecosystem. “Women always question if they’re qualified,” she said. “But look at these clowns around us.” The response to some of the events has been encouraging, some of the women said. Brit Morin, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour. She moved the meeting to a bigger venue, where all 500 seats sold out again. So she set up a livestream for the event; that evening, 16,000 viewers joined to watch. “We have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems,” Ms. Morin said. “Women want to be part of that.” The resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies, punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoin’s Facebook ad and Prodeum, the blockchain-for-fruit start-up. Neither company returned requests for comment. The gender imbalance was also on display at last month’s North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, which was organized by a prominent investor, Moe Levin. Mr. Levin originally slated 86 men and one woman as speakers. After complaints, he replaced two of the men with women to achieve what he thought should be enough: 84 men onstage and three women. “It just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers,” Mr. Levin said. “It’s not intentional not to include them. It’s just we don’t have time to include them.” When others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conference’s after-party would be held at a strip club, they encouraged Mr. Levin to change locations. He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could find. “Downtown Miami doesn’t have a whole lot of event spaces,” Mr. Levin said. “And we needed a lot of security.” The year before, the conference’s kickoff party featured underwear-clad models — painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logos. “Moe does something just as sexist every year,” said Rose Chan, who founded the World Bank’s blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project. “He switches it up, which actually means that he thinks about it.” One group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the future. Mr. Levin said this reaction surprised him. “There’s so many people who had a great time,” he said. At some women-in-crypto events, frustration is giving way to anger and sadness. On a recent night, about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Woman’s Club of Palo Alto. Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford University. Over wine, they shared their stories — some had been mistaken for hired models, others propositioned during job interviews, and many men had not believed they were engineers at all. Catheryne Nicholson, the chief executive of BlockCypher, which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications, explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deteriorated. “Now there’s a lot of money, and the men think, ‘Oh, I’m a whale now,’” she said. “They’re a little more full of themselves.” Karen Hsu, BlockCypher’s head of growth, said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated. She said that at a recent conference, she had been asked if she was a speaker, which was validating. “It was nice because he didn’t think I was a booth babe,” Ms. Hsu said, referring to hired models who stand near the booths of start-ups to draw the attention of conference attendees. Other women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down. Jay Graber, a developer at Zcash, a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy, was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear. She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks. Now she’s not so sure. “I never felt insecure before I got into this space,” Ms. Graber said. “But I just realized there is no one else like me. It is a very hard feeling when you don’t see anyone who is like you.” Ms. Graber said she had considered leaving the industry. “I have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation,” she said. “It’s just a general state of alienation.”",0.08749117647058824,0.05589819766290355
364,Bitcoin Thieves Threaten Real Violence for Virtual Currencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/technology/virtual-currency-extortion.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-18T19:25:51+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The currency they were after was virtual, but the guns they carried were anything but. In the beach resort of Phuket, Thailand, last month, the assailants pushed their victim, a young Russian man, into his apartment and kept him there, blindfolded, until he logged onto his computer and transferred about $100,000 worth of Bitcoin to an online wallet they controlled. A few weeks before that, the head of a Bitcoin exchange in Ukraine was taken hostage and only released after the company paid a ransom of $1 million in Bitcoin. In New York City, a man was held captive by a friend until he transferred over $1.8 million worth of Ether, a virtual currency second in value only to Bitcoin. The rich have always feared robbery and extortion. Now, big holders of Bitcoin and its brethren have become alluring marks for criminals, especially since the prices of virtual currencies entered the stratosphere last year. Virtual currencies can be easily transferred to an anonymous address set up by a criminal. While banks can stop or reverse large electronic transactions made under duress, there is no Bitcoin bank to halt or take back a transfer, making the chances of a successful armed holdup frighteningly enticing. Thieves have taken advantage of this system in a startling number of recent cases, from Russia, Ukraine and Turkey to Canada, the United States and Britain. “This is now becoming more pervasive and touching more law enforcement divisions that deal with organized crime and violent crime on a local level,” said Jonathan Levin, the founder of Chainalysis, which has worked with several law enforcement agencies on virtual currency crimes. Mr. Levin’s company specializes in tracking criminal transactions on the blockchain, the computerized ledger where every Bitcoin transaction is publicly recorded. Chainalysis has helped police attempt to track down criminals in several recent cases, including some that have not been made public, according to Mr. Levin. But even when a transaction can be tracked, the design of Bitcoin means that criminals do not have to associate their identity with their Bitcoin address — as is necessary with most traditional bank accounts. That has stymied police in several cases. “For this, the advantage of Bitcoin is that it’s hard to verify,” said Chanut Hongsitthichaikul, an investigator with the Chalong Police Station, which investigated the case in Phuket. “We asked the victim how to track it since they know Bitcoin better than us. We asked them how to check the receiver. They said there is no way. It is hard to do.” The Thai police tracked the victim’s laptop, which was also stolen, to Kuala Lumpur. That’s where the trail went cold. While the recent crime wave has brought a new level of violence, virtual currency holders have been targets for several years. Criminals have been staging a long-running campaign to remotely hijack the cellphone numbers of prominent virtual currency holders in order to gain control of their digital wallets. A few years ago, some of Bitcoin’s earliest proponents had SWAT teams called to their homes by people who demanded big Bitcoin payments to stop the harassment — a tactic called “SWATing” in some online communities. There have also been many documented holdups around the world at in-person meetings where people were looking to convert cash into virtual currency, including one last year in Palm Beach, Fla., where the thief made off with $28,000 before being arrested. But criminals have grown much more brazen as the price of Bitcoin has spiked. The most audacious attack hit Exmo, the virtual currency exchange in Ukraine. The chief executive of the exchange, Pavel Lerner, was abducted the day after Christmas and freed a few days later after the company made a ransom payment of Bitcoin worth around $1 million. A spokeswoman for Exmo said the money came from Mr. Lerner’s personal funds. Mr. Lerner was on leave from the company but would return. A month earlier, a Turkish businessman was forced to hand over the passwords to his virtual currency wallets — containing nearly $3 million worth of Bitcoin — after having his car stopped by an armed gang in Istanbul that appeared to know about his Bitcoin holdings, according to local news reports. Many big virtual currency holders privately say that they will no longer travel to Russia, Turkey or other countries where they assume that attacks may be easier to pull off because of organized crime. But armed attackers have also hit a Canadian Bitcoin exchange in Ottawa, the Ether investor in New York City and a prominent virtual currency trader living near Oxford, England. In a number of cases, the assailants have been caught — and forced to return money — because of video footage. In other cases, the criminals are still at large. The unsolved crimes have sown fear among the ranks of the so-called crypto rich, which have grown considerably over the past year. At a conference for about 170 leaders in the virtual currency industry this month, there was a panel discussion about how to deal with the threat of robbery, extortion and kidnappings in which the criminals seek Bitcoin or other virtual currencies. Organizers of the conference, known as the Satoshi Roundtable and held near Cancun, Mexico, brought in a security force and instituted significant privacy measures for guests to protect them from criminals while they were in attendance. During the group discussion at the conference, attendees talked about having a “duress wallet” at home that can be handed over to throw an assailant off the trail of a bigger fortune, as well as several other security measures that can be used to deal with the threat. Most of the crypto rich are loath to speak publicly about the risk of physical attacks, for fear of making themselves targets. But Jameson Lopp, a longtime Bitcoin engineer and virtual currency holder, said the community should be proactive in confronting the threat, to let criminals know that people are taking steps to protect themselves. Last summer, someone called a SWAT team to Mr. Lopp’s house to harass him. Since then, Mr. Lopp has installed closed-circuit cameras around his property and posted photos on Twitter of the automatic weapon he has at home. In a more technical defensive measure, Mr. Lopp has long kept his virtual currency in so-called multisignature wallets created by the company he works for, BitGo. These wallets require multiple people to sign off on a transaction before the money can move. Mr. Lopp will go even further later this year when he, his girlfriend and his dog move to a new home. He plans to “go dark” — not providing the address to anyone and using a post office box for deliveries. But he said even that will not fully banish his concerns. “If you are rich and you own real estate, or stocks or a sports team, somebody can’t mug you and take your sports team away,” he said. “Having liquid crypto assets makes you much more attractive for that type of criminal attack.” Mr. Levin said programmers are working to develop methods of signing virtual currency transactions that can quietly alert the authorities that a transaction is being made under duress — something like the hidden button under the bank teller’s desk. But he said the most obvious way to thwart attackers is with wallets that require multiple signatures, and with less public discussion about owning virtual currencies. Mr. Lopp said it is important to publicize the many ways in which virtual currency holders can fend off assailants so that criminals reconsider the likelihood of a successful attack. “We’re in the very early days of this becoming a problem,” Mr. Lopp said. “The attackers are still trying to figure out what the risk-reward really is.”",-0.15105,0.05032157512626262
365,Should Congress Create a Crypto-Cop?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/dealbook/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-regulation.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-14T20:51:28+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether have seeped into the public consciousness. Colleges including Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are offering classes in the blockchain technology that undergirds these virtual currencies to crowds of eager students. The mania has also gotten the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But both can only look on — perhaps in horror — at what is happening. Laws adopted decades ago give the two regulators little authority to engage in oversight of the burgeoning market in cryptocurrencies. That may change if Congress can muster the political will to extend the oversight responsibilities of two agencies it has been rather hostile to in recent years. A better way may be to create a new agency — one that does not carry the baggage that the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. do on Capitol Hill and that does not try to put the square peg of cryptocurrencies in the round holes of securities and commodities trading. At a recent hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., and J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., spoke about their limited power to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies. Mr. Clayton highlighted the risks posed by cryptocurrency trading platforms that call themselves “exchanges,” which gives the impression that they are regulated like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. But investors using such platforms “do not receive many of the market protections that they would when transacting through broker-dealers on registered exchanges,” Mr. Clayton said. Instead, the cryptocurrency exchanges are considered “money transmission” businesses, subject to a hodgepodge of state and federal rules that provide little protection to those who use their services. There are distinctions between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are not tied to a single company but instead operate more like regular money, and tokens issued by firms to help raise money in initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s. Mr. Clayton announced a much tougher stand on that second form of virtual assets. “The structures of I.C.O.s that I have seen involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements,” he said. The S.E.C. has filed cases against companies making coin offerings for selling unregistered securities, and more are certainly on the way. Mr. Giancarlo explained that his agency does regulate futures contracts that are tied to cryptocurrencies, and it can police firms executing transactions involving the contracts. But he pointed out that the C.F.T.C. “does not have regulatory jurisdiction over markets or platforms conducting cash or ‘spot’ transactions in virtual currencies, or over participants on those platforms.” To reach actual trading in cryptocurrencies, Congress would have to extend its authority to cover a cash commodity market, something lawmakers have not done. Investors need protection. Virtual currency firms have seen a rash of large-scale thefts from customer accounts. An Italian cryptocurrency exchange called BitGrail reported on Saturday that tokens called Nano worth approximately $170 million had gone missing in unauthorized transactions. An exchange in Japan called Coincheck disclosed in late January that hackers had stolen $530 million from the accounts of cryptocurrency investors. Any theft can be prosecuted under a range of federal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the wire fraud statute because cryptocurrencies are a form of property, even though they are intangible. But criminal prosecution is not a particularly effective weapon for battling hackers who plunder cryptocurrency wallets. Many of the exchanges are outside the United States, so finding those responsible is a challenge. Regulating the exchanges would be a significant step toward ensuring there is at least some protection for those buying and selling cryptocurrencies. That comes at a substantial cost, however, because the compliance requirements and reporting obligations for an exchange would be substantial. Operating with little government oversight has been a selling point for adherents of cryptocurrencies, but the growth in the market that has given rise to large-scale thefts and fraudulent schemes is fueling greater demand for some measure of accountability. Whether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight. Perhaps a new agency is needed. The S.E.C. was created by Congress in 1934 to implement greater federal regulation of the securities markets. The creation of, say, a Cryptocurrency Exchange Commission, or C.E.C., could address a rapidly developing product that defies easy categorization without having to deal with the demands — and foibles — of an entrenched bureaucracy.",0.1257909090909091,0.0705590810704447
366,What Bitcoin Reveals About Financial Markets,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/opinion/bitcoin-financial-markets.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-08T20:26:34+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The spectacular increase and recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have raised concerns that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will cause financial markets to crash. They probably won’t, but the Bitcoin bubble should finally destroy our faith in the efficiency of markets. Since the 1970s, economic policy has been based on the idea that financial market prices reflect all the information relevant to the value of any asset. If this is true, market prices are the best estimates of the value of any investment and financial markets should be relied on to allocate capital investment. This idea, referred to in the jargon of economics as the efficient market hypothesis (technically, the strong efficient market hypothesis), implicitly underlay the deregulation of financial markets that started in the 1970s. Although rarely stated now with as much confidence as it was during its heyday in the 1990s, the efficient market hypothesis remains a background assumption of much central-bank and economic policy. The hypothesis survived the absurdities of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the meltdown in derivative markets that led to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Although the hypothesis should have been refuted by those disasters, it lived on, if only in zombie form. But at least each of those earlier bubbles began with a plausible premise. The rise of the internet has transformed our lives and given rise to some very profitable companies, such as Amazon and Google. Even though it was obvious that most 1990s dot-coms would fail, it was easy to make a case for any of them individually. As for the derivative assets that gave us the global financial crisis, they were viewed favorably in light of a widely held theory, known as the “great moderation,” that suggested that major economic crises were a thing of the past, thanks to certain systemic changes in the way developed nations ran their economies. The theory was backed by leading economists and central bankers. Asset-backed derivatives were, ultimately, a bet on the great moderation. The contrast with Bitcoin is stark. The Bitcoin bubble rests on no plausible premise. When Bitcoin was created about a decade ago, the underlying idea was that it would displace existing currencies for transactions of all kinds. But by the time the Bitcoin bubble took off last year, it was obvious that this would not happen. Only a handful of legitimate merchants ever accepted Bitcoin. And as the Bitcoin bubble drove up transactions charges and waiting times, even this handful walked away. For a while, Bitcoin was used for transactions that people wanted to keep secret from government authorities, like drug deals. It soon became apparent, however, that if authorities wanted to track these transactions, they could. For instance, Silk Road, the first major online drug market, which made use of Bitcoin, was shut down by the F.B.I. in 2013. Hardly anyone now suggests that Bitcoin has value as a currency. Rather, the new claim is that Bitcoin is a “store of value” and that its price reflects its inherent scarcity. (By design, no more than 21 million Bitcoins can be created.) Most economists, including me, dismiss this claim. And if the claim is false, Bitcoin’s value is obviously another deadly strike against the efficient market hypothesis. But even if the claim is true, the idea that Bitcoin is valuable simply because people value it and because it is scarce should shake any remaining faith in the efficient market hypothesis. Consider: If Bitcoin is a “store of value,” then asset prices are entirely arbitrary. As the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has shown, nothing is easier than creating a scarce asset. The same argument would apply to any existing financial assets. Any stock in the S & P 500 could be priced not in terms of future earnings prospects but on the basis that people choose to value it highly. Suppose, more plausibly, that Bitcoin has no underlying value and will eventually become worthless. According to the efficient market hypothesis, financial markets will correctly estimate the true value of Bitcoin and will drive the price to zero immediately. But that hasn’t happened either. Until recently, it wasn’t even possible because the Bitcoin markets were themselves as opaque as the currency. Now it is possible: Futures trading for Bitcoin on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going on since December. But Bitcoin prices rose after the creation of futures trading and began their sharp decline only when governments took measures to limit speculation. Current futures contracts in Bitcoin extend as far as June of this year. According to those contract prices, the market expects Bitcoin to retain its value well into the future. Whatever happens to Bitcoin, we must not lose sight of a more fundamental — and more worrisome — development: A financial product with a purely arbitrary value has been successfully introduced in the world’s most sophisticated financial markets. Bitcoin probably won’t bring financial markets crashing down. But it shows that regulators need to cut those markets down to size.",0.2084227272727273,0.03214422362149635
367,Cryptocurrencies Come to Campus,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/technology/cryptocurrencies-come-to-campus.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-08T19:10:14+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"BERKELEY, Calif. — While the price of Bitcoin has dropped since Christmas, the virtual currency boom has shown no signs of cooling off in the more august precincts of America’s elite universities. Several top schools have added or are rushing to add classes about Bitcoin and the record-keeping technology that it introduced, known as the blockchain. Graduate-level classes this semester at Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland, among other places, illustrate the fascination with the technology across several academic fields, and the assumption that it will outlast the current speculative price bubble. “There was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin,” said David Yermack, a business and law professor at New York University who offered one of the first for-credit courses on the topic back in 2014. “But within a few months, I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers, and the joking from my colleagues stopped after that.” For a class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up. He now has 225 people signed up for the class. A course about virtual currencies created by a Princeton computer science professor, Arvind Narayanan, has been the fifth-most-popular class on Coursera, an online learning site. And last month at the University of California, Berkeley, students were lining the walls and sitting in the aisles for the first lecture of “Blockchain, Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology, Business and Law.” “This is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,” Dawn Song, a computer science professor, told the students. “There are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spot.” Because developments in the field are moving so fast, the business school professor also teaching the class, Greg La Blanc, said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasion. “We aren’t waiting until we perfect it,” he said. “Don’t compare it to the perfect blockchain course. Compare it to having no blockchain course at all.” The 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school, the business school and the engineering department, and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together. Ms. Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her department. The interest is a fueled by the rising price of virtual currencies over the last year. But they have created a host of issues that are worthy of study even apart from the price, professors in a variety of fields said. For lawyers, virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodity. Regulators have been caught flat-footed as entrepreneurs have raised billions of dollars by selling virtual currencies without going through the traditional fund-raising channels, taking advantage of the legal fuzziness surrounding them. For economists and business school professors, Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money. The first lecture in the Berkeley class, for example, considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money. Several business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is given credit for creating the first blockchain, a ledger of transactions that is updated by a network of computers without relying on any central company or government. Many big companies are now looking at how blockchains independent of Bitcoin might be used to do things like track music royalties or cargo containers with input from the many parties involved. “The students in my class are from every possible discipline,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke’s business school, who is teaching a class with 231 students this semester. “They understand that this is going to disrupt many different areas of business, and they want to be the disrupters, not the disruptees.” The computer scientists, meanwhile, are digging into the cryptography that virtual currencies use to secure their wallets and transaction data, as well as the design of the distributed computer networks that make blockchains possible. Last week, Stanford University hosted a three-day conference on the architecture and security of blockchain software, part of a new cottage industry in academic conferences and journals that have sprung up. “Let’s assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to $2,” said Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, who is teaching a course on “Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains and Applications” this semester. “I still think it’s very cool from a technical standpoint.” Professors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities, familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job market. The job site Indeed.com has reported a spike in job listings that mention the blockchain, and there is now an entire site, Crypto Jobs List, dedicated to opportunities in the young industry. Vinny Tuminelli, a business school student sitting at the back of the Berkeley class, said that during an internship at Anheuser-Busch last summer, the blockchain had come up in an “innovation team” he was on. When he met with his supervisor more recently, the topic came up again. “My original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword,” Mr. Tuminelli said. “But now it seems like it has some legs behind it, and people are putting real resources toward it.” Students appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors. Berkeley students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology, taught by the students themselves. The director of M.I.T.’s Digital Currency Initiative, Neha Narula, said that when it didn’t schedule a course for this semester, she got constant requests from students. So she put one together and is now co-teaching it. “Students are just fascinated with this area,” she said. “They want to learn about it desperately.”",0.2386833333333333,0.11454936267436269
368,Here Are the World’s Virtual Currency Billionaires (or at Least They Were),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/technology/forbes-virtual-currency-billionaires.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-07T10:00:26+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The creators of the famous Forbes rich list have made their first attempt to identify the wealthiest people in the virtual currency industry. Yet the list that was published on Wednesday, right after major drops in virtual currency prices, inadvertently also served as a reminder of the fleeting nature of that wealth. While the list in Forbes magazine, which was assembled in recent weeks, identifies about 10 virtual currency billionaires, most of them were not billionaires by the time the feature went online on Wednesday morning. On Monday alone, the prices of many virtual currencies plummeted over 20 percent, before stabilizing on Tuesday. At the top of the list is Chris Larsen, a founder of the Ripple virtual currency. Mr. Larsen was briefly estimated to be wealthier than Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg last month when Ripple’s price peaked, taking his net wealth to nearly $60 billion. Since then, the price of Ripple’s digital token, XRP, has fallen more than 80 percent. Forbes put Mr. Larsen’s wealth at around $8 billion, but the same holdings were worth less than $6 billion by Wednesday. Mr. Larsen is followed on the Forbes list by Joseph Lubin, an early investor in the Ethereum virtual currency network; Changpeng Zhao, founder of the virtual currency exchange Binance; the brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, longtime Bitcoin investors who are famous from their legal battles with Mr. Zuckerberg over Facebook; and Matthew Mellon, the banking heir who is now a major holder of XRP. The list is a reminder of how the biggest gains in virtual currencies have been reaped by a small number of early adopters — despite the early promises that virtual currencies could democratize the financial system and spread wealth more evenly. Nearly all of the people on the list either helped found virtual currencies or have been involved with them for years. Recent efforts to quantify the inequality among Bitcoin holders have found that it is significantly higher than in even the most stratified countries, which may sting many people who recently rushed into virtual currencies and are now sitting on losses. For early virtual currency adopters like the people on the Forbes list, the recent price declines are not catastrophic. The price of Bitcoin is still up 600 percent from a year ago, and up 70,000 percent from when the Winklevoss twins began buying in 2012. Identifying the richest people in the secretive and paranoid virtual currency realm is far from easy; some of it is guesswork. Mr. Lubin, whom Forbes pegged as the second-wealthiest person in the virtual currency universe, illustrates the difficulties. He told the magazine that he had begun selling his Ethereum tokens, known as Ether, last year to fund his business, ConsenSys. Because Forbes could not verify his holdings, the magazine put his wealth at between $1 billion and $5 billion before the most recent price declines. The normal Forbes billionaires list is easier to compile because the richest people in the world generally have most of their wealth tied up in stock holdings, which usually have to be disclosed for big public companies. With virtual currencies, it is not necessary to disclose your identity, and the system was created by people who were interested in protecting financial privacy. Many large holders of virtual currencies are loath to acknowledge their holdings for privacy and security reasons, and many people who are rumored to have giant Bitcoin stockpiles are not on the Forbes list. Perhaps the most notable omission is Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, whose identity has been guessed at many times but never confirmed. Researchers have guessed that Satoshi, as the creator is known, most likely amassed about one million Bitcoins during the network’s first year, when few other people were mining new tokens. Those Bitcoins would now be worth around $7 billion. Others have publicly claimed to have large holdings without verifying those holdings. Brock Pierce, a former child actor and the leader of a virtual currency community in Puerto Rico, has said he would donate $1 billion of his virtual currency fortune to charity, but Forbes said, “He refuses to provide documentation that proves he has anywhere near that much money.” The magazine estimated Mr. Pierce’s wealth at between $700 million and $1 billion. The list suggests that inventing virtual currencies can end up being less lucrative than investing in them. The magazine estimated that the inventor of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is less wealthy than two early investors, Mr. Lubin and Anthony Di Iorio, who had previously managed his family’s patio-door business in Canada. And while three big holders of Ripple’s token, XRP, are on the list, the inventor of the digital token, Jed McCaleb, is not.",0.18174722222222223,0.12883622935706268

CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela — On Tuesday, I went shopping for milk. With the chronic food shortages in Venezuela, that errand already is very complicated, but there’s an extra layer of difficulty for me: I don’t own bolívars, Venezuela’s official currency. I keep all of my money in Bitcoin. Keeping it in bolívars would be financial suicide: The last time I checked, the rate of daily inflation was around 3.5 percent. That’s daily inflation; the annual inflation rate for 2018 was almost 1.7 million percent. I don’t have a bank account abroad, and with Venezuela’s currency controls, there’s no easy way for me to use a conventional foreign currency like American dollars. Things just keep getting crazier here. Venezuela now has two presidents. One of them, Nicolás Maduro, wants to take on the British billionaire Richard Branson in a competition of charity concerts. While we Venezuelans are going hungry, there have been violent standoffs over humanitarian aid piling up at the borders with Colombia and Brazil. And before I can buy milk, I need to convert Bitcoins into bolívars. Actually, that part is easier than you might think. I go through the listings on LocalBitcoins.com, the exchange that most Venezuelans seem to use, looking for offers to buy my Bitcoins from people who use the same bank I do; that way the wire transfer can go through immediately. Once I accept the offer, the Bitcoins get deducted from my wallet and are held in escrow by the site. I send my banking information to the buyer and wait. After the buyer sends me the bolívars via wire transfer, I release the Bitcoins from escrow and they are transferred to the buyer’s Bitcoin wallet. We give each other a positive score, and that’s it. The whole process takes about 10 minutes. Turns out, I’m not the only Venezuelan using cryptocurrencies. The local market for Bitcoins broke a record on April 17, reaching $1 million worth on that day alone, Bloomberg reported. Venezuela has been ranking second worldwide in volume of activity on LocalBitcoins.com, after Russia. According to Coin Dance, a website that monitors cryptocurrency transactions, during the week ending on Feb. 16, people in Venezuela traded about $6.9 million on LocalBitcoins.com, compared with about $13.8 million in Russia. (I’m converting at the average Bitcoin exchange rate CoinMarketCap applied that week.) That’s saying something for a country in its fifth year of a recession, whose economy contracted by some 18 percent in 2018. I can’t change too many Bitcoins at once, though. The government doesn’t monitor cryptocurrency transactions (yet), but it does monitor transactions in bolívars — and any worth about $50 or more will automatically freeze your account until you can explain to your bank where the funds come from. Still, you could say that cryptocurrencies have saved our family. I now cover our household’s expenses on my own. My father is a government employee — in a printing department with no paper — and earns about $6 a month. My mother is a stay-at-home mom with no income. And cryptocurrencies helped my brother Juan, 28, escape Venezuela last summer. For years, he tried to make it as a lawyer here, but in times of hyperinflation, everyone is constantly getting poorer, including a lawyer’s clients. Juan was earning so little that he was actually spending money to work (buying stationery, taxi fare). Eventually he gave up.  Early last year, he started doing graphic design and translations online. But most websites pay for freelance work through PayPal and the like, which we can’t use because exchange controls here allow Venezuelan banks to use only local currency. (For the outside world, even those of us who have bank accounts here are effectively unbanked.) So Juan had to turn to cryptocurrencies to get paid. Thanks to those earnings, he started thinking about leaving Venezuela. He was able to buy what he needed for the trip to Colombia: clothes, a backpack, a smartphone. He put some money aside. He even gained a little weight, an anomaly around here these days. Cryptocurrencies also helped him during the four-day trip itself. Venezuelan military personnel at the borders have a reputation for seizing the money of people who want to leave, but Juan’s, being in Bitcoin, was accessible only with a password he had memorized. “Borderless money” is more than a buzzword for those of us who live in a collapsing economy and a collapsing dictatorship. The plan was for him to send money home — through cryptocurrencies — after he earned enough. Western Union converts remittances into bolívars at the official government rate, which often is about half of the rate on the black market. Some intermediaries do convert at the black market rate, and many of my Venezuelan friends living abroad use those. But if you don’t have a trusted trader, you can easily get scammed. And the government has been trying to shut down go-betweens like those for years. Using Bitcoin is cheaper, faster and safer. We had it all figured out. But then Juan couldn’t find a decent job in Colombia. After three months he ran out of money, and I had to send him Bitcoins so that he could come back to Venezuela. And even cryptocurrencies can go only so far.  On Tuesday, after changing my Bitcoins into bolívars — about $5 worth — I went out for milk. I went to every one of the stores within walking distance of my house that hasn’t shut down over the past year. Not one of the 20 had milk. But I had to buy something, anything, before my bolívars lost value. So I bought cheese, from a store that had only cheese. Well, it also had transparent green plastic bags with no labels and what the seller said was corn flour. But I didn’t dare to buy that.",0.05223064516129032,0.04659934599450728
370,"As Bitcoin Bubble Loses Air, Frauds and Flaws Rise to Surface",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/technology/virtual-currency-regulation.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-05T21:42:10+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — You did not have to be a technophobe to worry that the virtual-currency boom of the past year papered over plenty of problems. The scale of those problems is starting to become clear as digital tokens have slid more than 50 percent in value from their peaks in early January, with steep drops on Monday pushing the value of Bitcoin specifically below $7,000. Hackers draining funds from online exchanges. Ponzi schemes. Government regulators unable to keep up with the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies. Signs of trouble have appeared at nearly every level of the industry, from the biggest exchanges to the news sites and chat rooms where the investment frenzy has been discussed. On Tuesday, the leaders of the two main regulatory agencies in the United States that oversee the technology, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are to testify before the Senate banking committee about their efforts to police virtual currency markets. In the past two weeks, both have brought major cases, but people in the young industry said regulators had barely made a dent. Some virtual currency enthusiasts argue that the problems are no different from what has happened in other booms, like the internet bubble of the 1990s. But even true believers say the design of virtual currencies — meant to cut out middlemen and government authorities — has made bad behavior more prevalent amid this particular bubble. “Cryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,” said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “The combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large. The fact that the money got huge almost overnight, before there were good regulatory or even self-regulatory models in place, made the problem acute.” The fall from the peaks of early January has been dizzying. The value of all outstanding virtual currencies has been cut by more than half, down over $400 billion as of Monday, according to the website Coinmarketcap.com. In January, the heads of the main regulators wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the situation presented an unprecedented challenge. “These markets are new, evolving and international,” Jay Clayton, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s chairman, and J. Christopher Giancarlo, his counterpart at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, wrote. “As such they require us to be nimble and forward-looking.” Government agencies in the United States have shut down a few notable frauds. Early last month, securities regulators in Texas and North Carolina issued cease-and-desist orders to BitConnect, an operation that had grown to be worth $3 billion. But those moves only came after BitConnect had operated openly for months, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from people around the world despite being labeled a Ponzi scheme by many prominent people in the virtual currency industry. BitConnect offered tokens on a decentralized network, similar to Bitcoin, but promised regular payouts to coin holders. In January, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shut down My Big Coin, a purported swindle that had attracted $6 million. But regulators have not gotten near most of the brazen schemes that have popped up in the past year, many of which had been attacked by hackers first, or simply shut down by their operators after money had been raised. A new virtual currency, Proof of Weak Hands Coin, whose creators referred to it as a Ponzi scheme on Twitter and use a pyramid as a website logo, raised $800,000 before hackers got into its systems last week and drained its funds. Another pyramid scheme, MMM, which was shut down in an earlier incarnation by the Russian government, has been revived thanks to the popularity of Bitcoin and is operating openly, with particular success in Africa. One challenge facing regulators is that it is unclear how much of the deceptive activity they can legally control. Some online groups openly try to manipulate the prices of digital tokens in what are known as pump-and-dump schemes. Similar schemes involving stocks are illegal, but people operating the groups recently told BuzzFeed that they did not think the same rules applied to virtual currencies. Many schemes have been able to expand quickly because they do not use bank accounts and therefore do not have to win approval from established institutions. Instead, they are able to use virtual currency “wallets” without any approvals. And virtual currency transactions cannot be reversed like normal bank or even PayPal transfers. With regulators slow to crack down, the private sector has taken on a more important role. Facebook announced last week that it would no longer allow advertisements for virtual currency projects. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said they would bar customers from using credit cards to purchase virtual currencies; Citigroup followed suit on Monday. For investors, some of what has caused the most concern are well-intentioned businesses set up in a hurry with little outside oversight or time to work out kinks. Coincheck, which until last month was one of the largest exchanges in Japan, announced on Jan. 26 that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars of a virtual currency known as NEM, in what appeared to be the largest hack to hit the industry. Traders have been particularly worried about the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Bitfinex, an unregulated operation that has provided few details about its operations, raising concerns about whether it is insolvent or involved in price manipulation. In the United States, even the most widely used virtual currency company, Coinbase, has struggled to keep up with demand, shutting down trading for hours at particularly important moments, and attracting widespread complaints about its customer service. But the biggest number of incidents have cropped up around so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies to investors to raise money for software they are building. About 890 projects raised over $6 billion last year, a 6,000 percent increase over the year before, according to Icodata.io, which tracks the offerings. The $240 million raised through one of the most successful initial coin offerings last year, Tezos, is already frozen in a dispute between the founders of the project and the board they created in Switzerland. Even established companies like Kodak have ended up chasing the riches without doing proper due diligence. The company delayed its own initial coin offering after it was revealed that the people assisting the venture had problematic histories and little relevant experience. Most of the newer virtual currency projects borrow their basic design from Bitcoin, which uses a network of computers to maintain its records so that no central government or authority is needed. That design has allowed Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to grow as fast as they have with no regard for international borders, attracting followers from Zimbabwe to South Korea. It has also allowed some of the most talked-about uses of the technology, helping people escape hyperinflation in Venezuela or transfer money across borders with lower fees. But it has also allowed in a lot of bad actors. “It is a perfect storm for the kind of scammy activity we are seeing, and it’s not obvious to me how that is easily removed,” said Fred Wilson, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Venture and one of the earliest advocates of Bitcoin in Silicon Valley. “Regulation, ideally prudent and informed regulation, can help. But we may also need to have a big correction to really clean things up.”",0.06360392156862746,0.10715988668194551
371,Making a Crypto Utopia in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/technology/cryptocurrency-puerto-rico.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-02-02T10:00:30+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — They call what they are building Puertopia. But then someone told them, apparently in all seriousness, that it translates to “eternal boy playground” in Latin. So they are changing the name: They will call it Sol. Dozens of entrepreneurs, made newly wealthy by blockchain and cryptocurrencies, are heading en masse to Puerto Rico this winter. They are selling their homes and cars in California and establishing residency on the Caribbean island in hopes of avoiding what they see as onerous state and federal taxes on their growing fortunes, some of which now reach into the billions of dollars. And these men — because they are almost exclusively men — have a plan for what to do with the wealth: They want to build a crypto utopia, a new city where the money is virtual and the contracts are all public, to show the rest of the world what a crypto future could look like. Blockchain, a digital ledger that forms the basis of virtual currencies, has the potential to reinvent society — and the Puertopians want to prove it. For more than a year, the entrepreneurs had been searching for the best location. After Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure in September and the price of cryptocurrencies began to soar, they saw an opportunity and felt a sense of urgency. So this crypto community flocked here to create its paradise. Now the investors are spending their days hunting for property where they could have their own airports and docks. They are taking over hotels and a museum in the capital’s historic section, called Old San Juan. They say they are close to getting the local government to allow them to have the first cryptocurrency bank. “What’s happened here is a perfect storm,” said Halsey Minor, the founder of the news site CNET, who is moving his new blockchain company — called Videocoin — from the Cayman Islands to Puerto Rico this winter. Referring to Hurricane Maria and the investment interest that has followed, he added, “While it was really bad for the people of Puerto Rico, in the long term it’s a godsend if people look past that.” Puerto Rico offers an unparalleled tax incentive: no federal personal income taxes, no capital gains tax and favorable business taxes — all without having to renounce your American citizenship. For now, the local government seems receptive toward the crypto utopians; the governor will speak at their blockchain summit conference, called Puerto Crypto, in March. The territory’s go-to blockchain tax lawyer is Giovanni Mendez, 30. He expected the tax expatriates to disappear after Hurricane Maria, but the population has instead boomed. “It’s increased monumentally,” said Mr. Mendez, who has about two dozen crypto clients. “And they all came together.” The movement is alarming an earlier generation of Puerto Rico tax expats like the hedge fund manager Robb Rill, who runs a social group for those taking advantage of the tax incentives. “They call me up saying they’re going to buy 250,000 acres so they can incorporate their own city, literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world,” said Mr. Rill, who moved to the island in 2013. “I can’t engage in that.” The newcomers are still debating the exact shape that Puertopia should take. Some think they need to make a city; others think it’s enough to move into Old San Juan. Puertopians said, however, that they hoped to move very fast. “You’ve never seen an industry catalyze a place like you’re going to see here,” Mr. Minor said. Until the Puertopians find land, they have descended on the Monastery, a 20,000-square-foot hotel they rented as their base and that was largely unscathed by the hurricane. Matt Clemenson and Stephen Morris were drinking beer on the Monastery’s roof one recent evening. Mr. Clemenson had an easygoing affect and wore two-tone aviators; Mr. Morris, a loquacious British man, was in cargo shorts and lace-up steel-toed combat boots, with a smartphone on a necklace. They wanted to make two things clear: They chose Puerto Rico because of the hurricane, and they come in peace. “It’s only when everything’s been swept away that you can make a case for rebuilding from the ground up,” Mr. Morris, 53, said. “We’re benevolent capitalists, building a benevolent economy,” said Mr. Clemenson, 34, a co-founder of Lottery.com, which is using the blockchain in lotteries. “Puerto Rico has been this hidden gem, this enchanted island that’s been consistently overlooked and mistreated. Maybe 500 years later we can make it right.” Other Puertopians arrived on the roof as a pack, just back from a full-day property-hunting bus tour. From the middle, Brock Pierce, 37, the leader of the Puertopia movement, emerged wearing drop crotch capri pants, a black vest that almost hit his knees and a large black felt hat. He and others had arrived on the island in early December. “Compassion, respect, financial transparency,” Mr. Pierce said when asked what was guiding them here. Mr. Pierce, the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a major figure in the crypto boom. He co-founded a blockchain-for-business start-up, Block.One, which has sold around $200 million of a custom virtual currency, EOS, in a so-called initial coin offering. The value of all the outstanding EOS tokens is around $6.5 billion. A former child actor, Mr. Pierce got into digital money early as a professional gamer, mining and trading gold in the video game World of Warcraft, an effort funded partly by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser. Mr. Pierce is a controversial figure — he has previously been sued for fraud, among other matters. Downstairs, in the Monastery penthouse, a dozen or so other expats were hanging out. The water was out that night, so the toilets and faucets were dry. Mr. Minor lounged on an alcove chaise. “The U.S. doesn’t want us. It’s trying to choke off this economy,” Mr. Minor said, referring to the difficulties that crypto investors have with American banks. “There needs to be a place where people are free to invent.” Mr. Pierce paced the room with his hands in fists. A few times a day, he played a video for the group on his phone and a portable speaker: Charlie Chaplin’s 1940 “The Great Dictator,” in which Chaplin parodies Hitler rallying his forces. He finds inspiration in lines like “More than machinery, we need humanity.” “I’m worried people are going to misinterpret our actions,” Mr. Pierce said. “That we’re just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes.” He said he was aiming to create a charitable token called ONE with $1 billion of his own money. “If you take the MY out of money, you’re left with ONE,” Mr. Pierce said. “He’s tuned in to a higher calling,” said Kai Nygard, scion of the Canadian clothing company Nygard and a crypto investor. “He’s beyond money.” The force of Mr. Pierce’s personality and his spiritual presence are important to the group, whose members are otherwise largely agnostic. Mr. Pierce regularly performs rituals. Earlier that day while scoping out property, they had stopped at a historic Ceiba tree, known as the Tree of Life. “Brock nestled into the bosom of it and was there for 10 minutes,” Mr. Nygard said. Mr. Pierce walked around the tree and said prayers for Puertopia, holding a rusted wrench he had picked up in the territory. He kissed an old man’s feet. He blessed a crystal in the water, as they all watched. He played the Chaplin speech to everyone and to the tree, Mr. Nygard said. That wrench is now in the penthouse, heavy and greasy. Later on, at a dinner in a nearby restaurant, the group ordered platters of octopus arms, fried cheese, ceviche and rum cocktails. They began debating whether to buy Puerto Rico’s Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which measures 9,000 acres and has two deepwater ports and an adjacent airport. The only hitch: It’s a Superfund cleanup site. Mr. Pierce had fallen asleep by then, his hat tilted down and arms crossed. He gets two hours of sleep many nights, often on a firm grounding mat to stay in contact with the earth’s electric energy. Josh Boles, a tall, athletic man who is another crypto expat, picked him up, and the group headed back to the Monastery. They walked past a big pink building in an old town square, the start of their vision for Puertopia’s downtown. Once a children’s museum, they plan on making it a crypto clubhouse and outreach center that will have the mission “to bring together Puerto Ricans with Puertopians.” Workdays are casual in Puertopia. One morning, Bryan Larkin, 39, and Reeve Collins, 42, were working at another old hotel, the Condado Vanderbilt, where they had their laptops on a pool bar with frozen piña coladas on tap. “We’re going to make this crypto land,” Mr. Larkin said. Mr. Larkin has mined about $2 billion in Bitcoin and is the chief technology officer of Blockchain Industries, a publicly traded company based in Puerto Rico. Mr. Collins, an internet veteran, had raised more than $20 million from an initial coin offering for BlockV, his app store for the blockchain, whose outstanding tokens are worth about $125 million. He had also co-founded Tether, which backs cryptocurrency tied to the value of a dollar and whose outstanding tokens are worth about $2.1 billion, though the company has generated enormous controversy in the virtual currency world. “So, no. No, I don’t want to pay taxes,” Mr. Collins said. “This is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.” He had moved from Santa Monica, Calif., with just a few bags and was now starting a local cryptocurrency incubator called Vatom Factory. “When Brock said, ‘We’re moving to Puerto Rico for the taxes and to create this new town,’ I said, ‘I’m in,’” Mr. Collins said. “Sight unseen.” They soon went back to work, checking out Coinmarketcap.com, a site that shows the price of cryptocurrencies. “Our market cap’s gone up $100 million in a week,” Mr. Collins said. “Congrats, man,” Mr. Larkin said. All across San Juan, many locals are trying to figure out what to do with the crypto arrivals. Some are open to the new wave as a welcome infusion of investment and ideas. “We’re open for crypto business,” said Erika Medina-Vecchini, the chief business development officer for the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, in an interview at her office. She said her office was starting an ad campaign aimed at the new crypto expat boom, with the tagline “Paradise Performs.” Others worry about the island’s being used for an experiment and talk about “crypto colonialism.” At a house party in San Juan, Richard Lopez, 32, who runs a pizza restaurant, Estella, in the town of Arecibo, said: “I think it’s great. Lure them in with taxes, and they’ll spend money.” Andria Satz, 33, who grew up in Old San Juan and works for the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, disagreed. “We’re the tax playground for the rich,” she said. “We’re the test case for anyone who wants to experiment. Outsiders get tax exemptions, and locals can’t get permits.” Mr. Lopez said the territory needed something to jump-start the economy. “We have to find a new way,” he said. “Sure then, Bitcoin, why not,” Ms. Satz said, throwing up her hands. Mr. Lopez said he and a childhood friend, Rafael Perez, 31, were trying to set up a Bitcoin mine in their hometown. But electricity has been inconsistent, and mining even a single Bitcoin takes a lot of power, he said.",0.12267578125,0.06797217431006494

Bitcoin may save the internet? Celebrity social media feeds are bunk, and reality TV drag queens can unlock the mysteries of gender? Clearly there’s a lot to discuss. And we (that’s our Australia bureau) are here to help, with a few fantastic recent stories about the intersection of pop culture and technology — handpicked for Australian readers. When you’re done reading, come on over to our NYT Australia Facebook group for more discussion. ______ Some of us are human, some of us are bots. It sounds dystopian, but really: it’s just your social media feed. This report shines a light on social media’s murky black market, where politicians, athletes and celebrities are buying millions of fake followers. Even Australia’s politicians have been scrutinized: Tony Abbott reportedly gained 70,000 followers in 12 hours ahead of the 2013 election. Perhaps more alarmingly, these social drones might be borrowing your identity. Are my followers human? Tools like Twitter Audit, although not perfect, can tell you how “real” your followers are – or if you’re just tweeting into the bot-o-sphere. ______ If you think Bitcoin is just about money, you’re missing the point. Bitcoin’s foundation, blockchain, could be our guiding light back to the internet’s utopian, democratic roots. It sounds lofty, but disrupters have changed the nature of the internet before. And if you still don’t really get what cryptocurrency is, don’t worry: Mr. Johnson, one of Silicon Valley’s most respected tech writers, breaks it down with refreshing clarity. Should I invest in Bitcoin? No. There have been a few key moments that flung drag queens into the world’s popular consciousness. One is “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,” Stephen Elliot’s 1994 colorful and vulgar musical, and most recently: “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” The original Times review of “Priscilla” applauds how willing the film’s cross-dressing characters are to “laugh at themselves.” And 24 years later, reality TV host and drag performer RuPaul Charles now carries the torch of unrestrained, anarchist fun over political correctness. Where can I watch it already? Stream Season 3 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” on Stan. ______ Millions of women around the world have said #MeToo, but the impact of those words can depend on your level of celebrity, wealth, skin color, or just where you are in the world. In China, the government is blocking phrases like “anti-sexual harassment” on social media, effectively muzzling the movement. One professor suggests it’s partly because “people are not encouraged to speak up against superiors” in Chinese culture. As Australia continues to grapple with sexual assault on its campuses, could international students be less likely to report harassment? How can I follow how #MeToo is developing around the world? We’re glad you asked. Sign up to The #MeToo Moment newsletter to get weekly missives on gender and sexual harassment news in your inbox each week. Who would have thought painstakingly slow, hand-painted messages would be an incredibly effective way to cut through the digital cacophony? Paul Lindahl didn’t. But he pursued the outmoded career path anyway. Now, as brands are searching for new ways to convey “authenticity” and “meaning,” Mr. Lindahl is courting names like Gucci, Coca-Cola and Spotify from his paint-spattered Brooklyn studio. How could it go wrong? By hand-painting your advertisement over a well-loved, 20-year-old community mural, like another company did in the Sydney neighborhood of Newtown last year. It didn’t go down well. “Whoever thought that operational security could be wrecked by a Fitbit?” said Nathan Ruser, 20, in an interview from Thailand.

Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don’t expect the company to go public this year. What’s happening: Ms. Johnson, who’s currently the home-rental company’s chief business affairs and legal officer, will become its chief operating officer. Meanwhile, Mr. Tosi, who had been Airbnb’s chief financial officer since coming over from Blackstone, will leave the company to focus on his investment fund. Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company’s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis. Between the lines • Ms. Johnson had been a rising star at Airbnb, often compared to Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg as the company’s business-minded grown-up in the room. • Mr. Tosi had been increasingly at odds with Airbnb’s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, over strategy. (The Information covered their disputes — which were over both strategy and tactics — in great detail.) The context  Airbnb is heading ever so slowly toward an initial public offering. It hired Ken Chenault as its first outside director, for example, and promoting its most successful business mind to C.O.O. is another step in that direction. Still losing its C.F.O. — particularly one well versed in Wall Street — could set those plans back a bit. The company line Here’s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson: And here’s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies: And here’s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi: — Michael J. de la Merced Some of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook. Facebook’s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe. The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook’s future growth. The company’s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada. Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe’s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States’, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower. All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada. What does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at protecting their citizens that may go beyond what the company is used to in the United States? Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe’s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook’s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond. — Peter Eavis Its price on Thursday: $8,915 Its all-time high hit on Dec. 18: $19,511. That’s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin’s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg. The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday. Regulators are increasingly worried that Bitfinex, a widely used (and famously opaque) exchange, has been propping it up.

That year Saudi Arabia poured $3.5 billion into Uber, and its Public Investment Fund put $45 billion into SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, which is making eye-popping investments in tech companies.

374,Worries Grow That the Price of Bitcoin Is Being Propped Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-31T23:40:00+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"A growing number of virtual currency investors are worried that the prices of Bitcoin and other digital tokens have been artificially propped up by a widely used exchange called Bitfinex, which has a checkered history of hacks and opaque business practices. In December, Bitfinex was subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a United States regulatory agency. The news, first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday and confirmed by a source familiar with the subpoena but not allowed to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation, led to a sell-off in most virtual currencies. The people behind Bitfinex issue a virtual currency called Tether. Unlike most digitals tokens, every Tether is supposed to be backed by traditional money — the United States dollar. New Tether tokens are issued when investors give them dollars. One dollar is worth one token. Because of the credibility that comes with that tie to the dollar, Tether are often used to buy other virtual currencies like Bitcoin. In recent months, however, many investors have been raising alarm bells about Tether. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex. “This became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,” said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. “It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.” Long before news of the subpoena, Bitfinex, which is believed to host more trading than any other Bitcoin exchange in the world, had gained a reputation for a lack of transparency and a confusing structure, with European executives, offices in Asia and registration in the Caribbean. It is not yet clear what information the regulators are seeking. Technically, the Tether tokens are issued by a separate company (called Tether) that is owned and operated by the same people who run Bitfinex. The C.F.T.C. subpoenaed that company at the same time that it subpoenaed Bitfinex, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bitfinex has not commented on the subpoena or recent reports about Tether, and company officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In the past, the exchange’s executives and spokesman have said that its customers are simply using Tether to buy virtual currencies as they might otherwise use United States dollars. Bitfinex had contracted with an American firm, Friedman, to audit its records and prove that its operation of Tether is above board. But last week, Bitfinex said it was cutting ties with Friedman, after waiting months for it to finish the audit. That news generated more suspicion. “It’s a signal to the market of what those who have scrutinized the situation already believe: There is a problem here,” said Jill Carlson, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who now consults with a variety of virtual currency companies. “The dissolution of a relationship between an auditor and a company is very rarely a good sign that the company is behaving in accordance with market best practices.” The concern about Bitfinex is one of several issues that have helped depress the value of virtual currencies over the last month, after a roaring, yearlong rally. Regulators in several countries, like South Korea and the United States, have expressed concerns about manipulation and fraud, and hinted at a crackdown. In Japan, a large virtual currency exchange, Coincheck, was hacked in late January and lost nearly $500 million worth of a virtual currency known as NEM, raising questions about the relatively untested security practices of virtual currency exchanges. Still, Japan is one of the few places where virtual currency exchanges are overseen by regulators. Many of the largest virtual currency exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate with essentially no regulatory oversight. Bitfinex was hacked in 2015 and again in 2016, and Tether was hacked at the end of last year — with the combined losses totaling more than $100 million. The company shared few details about these hacks. But after the biggest theft, in 2016, it was cut off by Wells Fargo and its banks in Taiwan. The banking problems have made it hard for customers to get money in and out of Bitfinex, but traders have continued to use the exchange, in part because of Tether. Tether offered a preliminary report last year from Friedman, the accounting firm, suggesting that it had bank accounts with dollars corresponding to all the Tether that had been issued. But the report was far from conclusive and Tether has never produced a real audit, leading to suspicions that Bitfinex may be printing virtual money backed by nothing. The Tether currency has been valuable to traders because it allows them to hold a stable token, tied to the value of the dollar, and move it quickly between virtual currency exchanges. But there is a downside. Because the identity of Tether holders is not always clear, the movement of the virtual token between exchanges — and across national borders — has raised concerns among lawyers about money laundering. The spread of Tether beyond Bitfinex has also spread the risk of its failure to other exchanges. Market analysts have grown particularly concerned with the rapid pace at which new Tether have been issued and their timing. In a single week in mid-January, $450 million new Tether were created, bringing the total amount of Tether to more than $2 billion. Several anonymous reports circulating among traders, including one posted to a website last week, have pointed to data from Bitfinex itself, showing that the price of Bitcoin has frequently gone up soon after new Tether were created, generally as a result of big trades on Bitfinex. “This absolutely reeks of price manipulation,” a security researcher and market analyst, Tony Arcieri, wrote on his blog in mid-January. Many investors and traders have pushed back against that criticism, noting that smart traders simply may be looking to buy when the markets are down. “My personal biases make me inclined to believe that Bitfinex is not using Tether to manipulate the price of Bitcoin,” said Jeremy Gardner, a managing partner at the investment firm Ausum Ventures. “If they have attempted to do so, which would be deeply concerning, it’s hard to imagine that such fraudulent issuance at its current volume could single-handedly buoy the price of Bitcoin.” But Mr. Krug, at Pantera Capital, said that if Tether were really being used by investors, they would probably also want to buy new Tether when the markets were going up, which has not been the case. Also, they would not always want it in exact increments of $100 million, as has been the case. “After you see this enough times, you just start to wonder what’s really going on here,” Mr. Krug said. The Bitcoin community is sensitive to the possibility of price manipulation because a team of academics published an article in early January suggesting that the price of Bitcoin was artificially inflated in 2013 by a single player operating on the largest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox. One of the authors of that paper, Tyler Moore, said it could be hard to tell if similar price manipulation were going on today, though he noted that a lack of transparency made it hard for anyone to be certain of anything. “Greater assurances are needed that the trades taking place are in fact legitimate and reflect buying and selling by independent actors,” said Mr. Moore, an assistant professor at the University of Tulsa. “Unless and until such oversight is implemented, we cannot trust the exchange rate to reflect only legitimate sources of supply and demand.”",-0.032649090909090905,0.04414872753509117
375,Facebook Bans Ads for Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/facebook-cryptocurrency-ads.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-30T21:47:13+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Want to get rich quick through Bitcoins or other virtual currencies? You’ll have to do it without Facebook. The social network said Tuesday that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in order to stop promotions that it sees as “frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” Under Facebook’s new policy, no ads from well-known digital currency exchanges or for initial coin offerings will be allowed. Among those who will be affected is James Altucher, a self-described “crypto genius” whose viral ads have become a talking point in how the cryptocurrency boom has led to scams and wild price fluctuations. Facebook’s move followed questions about whether it has done enough to protect its site from bad actors. The company has been trying to clamp down on misinformation and false news after admitting last year that Russian agents had used it to spread divisive and polarizing messages. The world of cryptocurrencies, which people have flooded into as prices soared in recent months, has also increasingly raised fears that parts of the market are dogged by scams. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it had halted what may have been a fraudulent initial coin offering that asked people to fund what was supposed to be the world’s first “decentralized bank.” Rob Leathern, a Facebook product management director, announced the ban on cryptocurrency ads in a blog post. He said the ban was intentionally broad, as Facebook seeks to “better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices.” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has recently expressed an interest in digital currencies. In a Facebook post this month, he wrote that he was studying how to introduce cryptocurrency to his company, adding that he thought it would “take power from centralized systems and put it back into people’s hands.”",-0.39936666666666665,0.0105885241301908
376,Kodak’s Dubious Cryptocurrency Gamble,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/kodak-blockchain-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-30T10:00:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"An eon or two ago, Eastman Kodak was a bleeding-edge technology company. It hired the smartest engineers and put them to work racking up patents, pioneering new chemical processes and building a globe-spanning camera and film business that, at its peak, employed 145,000 people. But the digital photo age passed Kodak by, and today, the Rochester, N.Y., company exists mostly in the past tense. Many of the patents have been sold, buildings have been rented out or demolished, and the company has continued to shrink since it filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Now, the 130-year-old company is trying an unlikely sort of comeback — one built by betting on cryptocurrency. It’s a bold gamble that has excited some investors, perplexed others and raised questions about how closely Kodak vetted its cryptocurrency business partners, who now include a paparazzi photo agency, a penny-stock promoter and a company offering what has been called a “magic money making machine.” This month, Kodak lent its name to a digital currency called KodakCoin, which is billed as “a photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.” The basic idea behind KodakCoin is to use the blockchain to help photographers manage their collections by creating permanent, immutable records of ownership. The company also struck a licensing deal for a Bitcoin-mining computer called the Kodak KashMiner, which allows users to generate their own cryptocurrency. Kodak’s stock rose more than 200 percent following the announcements, and has not fallen much since. That’s partly because the blockchain — the mathematical ledger system that forms the basis of digital currencies — has a kind of talismanic effect in today’s stock market. As investors seek to capitalize on the popularity of currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a number of struggling companies have reversed their fortunes, at least temporarily, simply by adding “blockchain” to their names or announcing a new cryptocurrency venture unrelated to their previous line of work. (The most notorious example is Long Island Iced Tea Corp., a beverage company that tripled its value overnight after it rebranded itself “Long Blockchain Corp.”) These sudden, brazen moves have also attracted the attention of regulators. In a recent speech, Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the agency was “looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology.” Kodak is the most prominent old-line company to enter the cryptocurrency game so far, and maybe the most controversial. Almost immediately, critics pounced on the company’s plans, characterizing them as a desperate money grab. “It feels like a publicly traded company issuing a token to raise its stock price from the grave,” said Kyle Samani, a partner at the cryptocurrency trading firm Multicoin Capital. “I would not be sleeping very well if I was involved in this,” said Jill Carlson, a blockchain consultant. In an interview, Jeff Clarke, Kodak’s chief executive, said that the company’s blockchain ambitions were genuine. He began looking into blockchain technology last summer, he said, and realized that it could solve a perennial problem for photographers — proving ownership of their images, tracking down copyright violators, and getting paid. “This is not a dog food company that’s creating a currency,” Mr. Clarke said. “This is a real solution around digital rights management that Kodak has been involved in for many years.” In theory, photographers will be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne, create a blockchain-based license for each image, and use web-crawling software to scour the internet looking for copyright violations. Instead of using dollars, photographers can have clients pay them in KodakCoins. KodakCoin’s initial offering, scheduled for Wednesday, is expected to raise as much as $20 million. (On Tuesday night, KodakCoin’s website said that it would delay the offering by “several weeks” to verify the credentials of potential investors.) But there are few details about what that money will be used for, or why a similar system could not be built without the blockchain. There is also a more obvious question: Why would photographers want to be paid in digital tokens, rather than cash? In several calls with KodakCoin leaders, I couldn’t get straight answers to these questions. And KodakCoin’s white paper, a technical document that details the plans for the currency, is a 40-page mishmash of marketing buzzwords and vague diagrams, like the one below: Make no mistake: Digital rights management is a real issue for photographers, and the blockchain does, in theory, offer a compelling solution. But the specific attributes of KodakCoin present some red flags. First, despite the name, KodakCoin is not actually a Kodak project. The company behind the offering, WENN Digital, is a California-based affiliate of a British photo agency that specializes in paparazzi photo licensing. Under their licensing agreement, Kodak will not receive any direct revenue from the public offering. It will receive a minority stake in WENN Digital, 3 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a royalty on future revenue. Cameron Chell, a lead adviser to the KodakCoin project, told me that the initial offering represented a “seminal moment” for Kodak, and that the company’s interest in blockchain technology was a savvy long-term investment. “The real story is that it’s about to be a renaissance,” he said. But Mr. Chell, a Canadian entrepreneur and motivational speaker who once opened for Tony Robbins, has a troubled track record. In 1998, Mr. Chell agreed to a five-year ban from the Alberta Stock Exchange in Canada and paid a $25,000 fine in connection with a violation of the exchange’s rules. A previous company of his ended in ignominy after its chairman was  charged with fraud. Asked about these incidents, Mr. Chell said that he was “young, inexperienced and was irresponsible in my actions,” and that he had “learned a lot since 1998 and work hard to conduct myself in a manner that does not reflect that poor judgment.” A Kodak spokesman did not return a request for comment about Mr. Chell and whether it knew about the ban. Mr. Chell has refashioned himself as a blockchain expert in recent years, and KodakCoin is his biggest project so far. He is the chairman of Appcoin Innovations, which was registered as a literary agency — Redstone Literary Agents — until last year, when it became a consulting firm that provides “a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,” according to securities filings. The company, which trades over the counter as a penny stock, earned no revenue in 2015 or 2016, according to S.E.C. filings. Appcoin Innovations is slated to receive 20 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a portion of the offering proceeds, a stake that could amount to millions if the offering is successful. “Once formally launched,” Mr. Chell wrote to me in an email, “the company will hopefully provide shareholders a traditional and transparent place to participate in the crypto space with projects that are regulatory compliant.” Now, about those coins. You might think that a digital currency that is trying to “democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists,” in Mr. Clarke’s words, would be easily accessible. But because of regulatory requirements, KodakCoins will be available only to so-called accredited investors in the United States. An accredited investor is defined as a person with a net worth of $1 million or more, or an annual income above $200,000. How many cryptocurrency-obsessed millionaire photographers do you know? Even if photographers do meet the requirements to participate, they could have a hard time spending their KodakCoins, or redeeming them for cash. The S.E.C. has warned that securities sold in private offerings, such as KodakCoins, may be difficult to resell — and that investors may be required to hold on to them “indefinitely.” A KodakCoin representative told me that the company believes its tokens will eventually be freely traded, and that it may issue other types of tokens in the future that will not be subject to the same restrictions. KodakCoin’s white paper says that token holders may receive other benefits, such as a share of KodakOne’s revenue and access to a “marketplace” that will allow them to spend their KodakCoins on camera equipment, studios for photo shoots, and travel expenses. But these benefits could fail to materialize. Cryptocurrency experts also do not seem impressed with the Kodak KashMiner, a Bitcoin-mining machine advertised at this year’s CES electronics trade show. According to the advertisement, users will pay $3,400 to rent the machine, a Kodak-branded computer that solves complex math equations to unlock new Bitcoin, for two years. Half the Bitcoins successfully mined with the Kashminer will go back to Spotlite, the company licensing Kodak’s name, and the user will keep the other half. Kodak hasn’t shared many details about its KashMiner deal. But renting the machines could be a hard sell. In its CES advertisement, KashMiner estimates that each renter will earn $9,000 from mining Bitcoin over the two-year contract window. Experts told me that figure was most likely inflated, because Bitcoin mining gets harder over time. And they pointed out that the KashMiner itself appears to simply be a rebranded version of a popular Bitcoin-mining machine that can be purchased outright for less than the rental cost. All of this — the origins of KodakCoin, the currency itself and the lofty claims about the KashMiner’s moneymaking potential — adds up to a big question mark, and points to the possibility that Kodak may be in over its head. “The best-case scenario is that they believe that the technology will eventually be able to deliver what they’ve pitched,” said Ms. Carlson, the blockchain consultant. “The worst-case scenario is that they are just being very opportunistic.” Mr. Clarke, Kodak’s chief executive, characterized the blockchain projects as a small part of the company’s overall strategy, and said it was “ironic” that critics were faulting Kodak for embracing a young technology like cryptocurrency, given that its past problems were caused by a failure to innovate. “This isn’t speculative,” Mr. Clarke said. “We’re taking an emerging new technology in blockchain, and we’re using it to solve a real problem.”",0.05835342465753425,0.07629773765047738

Now Paddle8 is trying a new tack: merging with The Native, a Swiss technology and e-commerce company, and adopting the use of blockchain, the technology that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin. Paddle8 announced on Tuesday that it had taken an investment from The Native, creating what the two say is a partnership meant to adapt online art sales — and potentially more — to an age of wealthy millennials well versed in virtual currencies. Their first partnership will be Paddle8 Lab, which is meant to help introduce tech to online art and luxury sales and will draw on The Native’s Blockchain Lab division. A revamped Paddle8 will open this spring with services meant to go beyond art auctions into other luxury offerings. And the company will hold its first art and luxury auction accepting Bitcoin — already titled “Bidcoin” — on Aug. 18. “This is a way for us to show we can better align with a new generation of collectors,” Alexander Gilkes, a founder of Paddle8, said in a telephone interview. In 2016, Paddle8 merged with Auctionata in an effort to create a next-generation trans-Atlantic online auction house — but the marriage dissolved early last year when Auctionata filed for insolvency after serious questions about its business practices came to light. “Last year was a horrible start to the year,” Mr. Gilkes said. Of the merger with Auctionata, he added, “There were very many salient reasons for doing it, but we didn’t see how the events would unfold.” Sergey Skaterschikov, The Native’s chairman, said he saw the benefits of applying blockchain technology, essentially an online ledger of transactions, to the art world. “A lot of the art trade is built on asymmetric information,” he said. “It was scaring a lot of potential buyers from the collectible market.” The Native will buy a 15 percent stake in Paddle8 for 8.5 million Swiss francs, or $8.8 million. The Native will also have an option to buy an additional 36 percent of Paddle8 for 24.5 million Swiss francs, giving it a majority stake. “The nature of the transaction actually solved for our reservations,” Osman Khan, another Paddle8 founder, said. “It really is a somewhat more cautious approach, after what we’d gone through.” Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the investors who have long been proponents of Bitcoin and virtual currencies, have advised Paddle8 since 2015 and had pushed the company to adopt blockchain technology. “We’ve long considered cryptocurrency as key to increasing transparency in markets around the world, including the art market,” Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement.",0.14661111111111114,0.06113215488215488
378,Is Blockchain Technology Overhyped?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/books/review/blockchain.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-02-15,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Blockchain, the ingenious database technology best known for underpinning the faddish digital currency Bitcoin, is reviving the utopian fantasies of the early internet era. In an influential manifesto from that time, “A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” published in 1996, the essayist and activist John Perry Barlow opposed the idea of government regulation of the internet, offering instead an anarchical vision of an online world in which a decentralized network of people existed free from all authorities and intermediaries save for their own “social contract.” Whatever else Barlow’s statement might have been, it was not prophetic. The online world today is full of authorities and intermediaries — search engines, social media platforms, cloud computing services, internet service providers — all of which exert considerable control over cyberspace and are themselves shaped by laws and regulations. It is hard to imagine a cyberlibertarian paradise emerging from that. Or it was hard to imagine, until blockchain came along. The first blockchain was the database introduced in 2009 as the infrastructure of Bitcoin; it is where every transaction involving Bitcoin is stored. Because this database is “distributed” (it is supported only by the network of its many thousands of users, with no central or controlling nodes) and because, thanks to a cunning design, it can essentially guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the information it stores, it demonstrates that a functioning currency does not require a bank or equivalent centralized institution. Whether Bitcoin itself ends up being successful is not what matters. What matters is the discovery that the underlying blockchain technology can obviate the need for centralized authorities in contexts where they were once thought to be indispensable. This includes social, political, economic and legal transactions involving not just currency but also stock certificates, deeds to plots of land, titles to copyrighted works, remittance payments, food supply chains, votes in an electoral system and so on. For the John Perry Barlows of today, blockchain represents a new opportunity to free people from governments, corporations and other sources of centralized control. (Indeed, a few true believers, made rich during the recent digital currency boom, are spending millions of dollars on potential experimental communities where rights and contracts would be implemented using blockchain technology.) But for the legal scholars Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright, the innovative promise of blockchain, though real, has been exaggerated. As they argue in BLOCKCHAIN AND THE LAW: The Rule of Code (Harvard University, $35), the growth and evolution of this technology “will follow a similar path” to that of the internet itself: from anarchic potential to a more regulated and controlled reality. They also argue that this is desirable — that blockchain visionaries looking to free people from the hegemony of governments and corporations “could wind up surrendering themselves (and others) to the whims of a much more powerful enemy”: namely, the self-governing code of blockchain itself. To understand why many proponents of blockchain assume, contrary to De Filippi and Wright, that the technology can and should remain impervious to external control, it helps to understand some details about how such a technology works. Imagine you want to send someone a certain amount of Bitcoin as payment for a service provided. Rather than having the payment go through a bank to be authorized, as it would if you paid with a check or credit card, the proposed transaction is shared with and authorized by the entire Bitcoin network. To determine whether you have enough Bitcoin to make your payment, the computers on the network search through the history of all previous Bitcoin transactions. If your transaction is valid, it is added to a list, or “block,” of recent pending transactions. Every 10 minutes or so, the latest block is collectively verified by the network and added to the “chain” of all the previous blocks. Everyone’s Bitcoin account balance is updated accordingly. This communally maintained history of total transactions — a copy of which is shared with every node of the network — is the blockchain. What makes the design of blockchain so clever, De Filippi and Wright note, is its solution to an obvious concern with the description above: Why trust the network? After all, the network is open to anyone and can be joined pseudonymously. What is stopping someone from creating hundreds of Bitcoin accounts and voting to impose a bogus “consensus” on the state of the database? The technology solves this problem by making the task of adding a block to the chain into a competition: Any Bitcoin user who is interested can try to solve, by brute trial and error (and with the help of a high-powered computer), a mathematical puzzle generated by the Bitcoin software. If you find the solution, you broadcast it to the rest of the network; if a majority of the network agrees you’ve solved the puzzle (it’s simple to confirm), you receive a payment (in the form of newly minted or “mined” Bitcoin) and the block is added to the chain. The difficulty of the competition, which is automatically calibrated by the software so that the puzzle becomes harder the more users join in, virtually ensures that no single user can monopolize the network. De Filippi and Wright agree with blockchain’s most passionate proponents that the technology’s design gives it many features that are desirable. Because it is decentralized, it cannot be dominated by a single power. Because it is tamper resistant, it cannot be used fraudulently. Because the information it stores is distributed to every node in the network, it is resilient in the face of damage or destruction. In many contexts, such as unstable political environments, these qualities make the technology especially valuable. (There have been efforts in Honduras and the former Soviet republic of Georgia to register property or land titles using blockchain.) But De Filippi and Wright stress that because blockchain is essentially autonomous, it is inflexible, which leaves it vulnerable, once it has been set in motion, to the sort of unforeseen consequences that laws and regulations are best able to address. Fortunately, they argue, though the absence of a central authority can make it seem as if blockchain offers no “object of regulation,” there are in fact many entities the government can target to influence how blockchains are run, including internet service providers, hardware manufacturers, software developers and the many supplementary services (like “wallets” and currency exchanges) now being run on these networks. In THE BLOCKCHAIN AND THE NEW ARCHITECTURE OF TRUST (MIT, $27.95), the legal scholar Kevin Werbach stakes out a position similar to that of De Filippi and Wright, arguing that “like the internet the blockchain is mistakenly viewed as the final answer to the problem of intermediation” — the problem of inefficient, unwanted or unreliable go-betweens. The trouble with this view, he notes, is that intermediaries, when trustworthy, play many beneficial roles: pairing buyers with sellers, bundling demand to create economies of scale, correcting imbalances in bargaining power. Because there is no widespread desire to eliminate intermediaries, he predicts that blockchain technology will most often “supplement or complement conventional legal regimes, not replace them,” proving most useful when rigidity and automation are valuable. Blockchain might be used, for example, to mechanize the enforcement of reporting rules for banks, so that government agencies need not actively monitor every relevant bank transaction. Werbach is fond of invoking a “governance paradox” that he attributes to the economic sociologist Vili Lehdonvirta: The very mechanisms needed to make a decentralized system like blockchain desirable — namely, apparatuses of oversight and regulation — appear to make the system no longer decentralized. However, Werbach argues, the most significant innovation of blockchain is not governmental or even technological but emotional: the creation of “a new form of trust,” in which you put your confidence in a store of information without relying on any single person to authenticate it — trust the system, not its parts. The outstanding question is whether this method of cultivating trust is viable, and if it is, in what ways we can best deploy it. The answers we come up with are likely to determine blockchain’s future.",0.25213170731707313,0.15244452363354805
379,Why the I.R.S. Fears Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/opinion/irs-bitcoin-fear.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-22T23:57:56+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a “Bitcoin bust” that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators. But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue. The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive. But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States — estimated at 8.4 percent of output — is relatively small compared with those of other countries. If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become “the next Swiss bank account.” The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions). Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C. A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., “I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.” As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000. The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are “arm’s length” counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules. It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be. One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product. More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs. A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code. The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion. More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult — but no less necessary — challenge.",0.03206904761904762,0.09292690224237844
380,The View From the Bitcoin Bubble,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/insider/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-digital-reporting.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-22T15:58:41+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Five years ago, I wrote my first article about virtual currencies, documenting the sizable stockpile of Bitcoins that the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, had amassed. At the time, I figured Bitcoin would be a flash in the pan, with roughly the life span of pet rocks or Furbys. But neither Bitcoin nor the Winklevii, as they’re known, has withered under the unending stream of skepticism. The value of a single Bitcoin is now up more than 11,000 from when I wrote that first story, and the brothers have become billionaires, at least on paper. I have continued writing about Bitcoin throughout its remarkable rise, but I could have never anticipated the way the technology has broken out over the past year, with everyone from Vladimir Putin to mom-and-pop investors in South Korea looking at how to use and profit from the technology. (Most recently, I wrote about the enormous electricity consumption of the network of computers supporting Bitcoin, which now uses as much energy as some medium-sized countries.) These developments have been enough to turn me, over the last year, into essentially a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. It’s safe to say that’s a first for The Times. Before this all began, I was covering financial markets and banks from New York. That gave me a grounding to begin understanding this, but Bitcoin has turned into a very different kind of financial market. At the banks, I kept hearing about how they were taking this technology seriously as something that might change their business in the long run. That is because beneath the digital tokens, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of crowdsourced financial infrastructure, known as the blockchain, that allows for the creation of money and financial records that aren’t maintained by any central authority like a bank or a government. Claims about Bitcoin’s longevity differ dramatically. If you listen only to virtual currency aficionados, you would think that digital money is certain to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and kill Wall Street, to boot. I get dozens of emails every day from entrepreneurs who tell me how they are going to use the technology introduced by Bitcoin to revolutionize the music industry, or shipping business, or even democracy itself. Meanwhile, very smart people like Warren Buffett and Joseph Stiglitz have continued to say that the whole thing is just a bubble waiting to burst. How is a single journalist supposed to work through it all? It can feel a bit like being there at the invention of the stock market, but with no certainty that stocks would actually work as promised — and with everything hinging on software that few people understand. Certainly one part of this requires understanding the technical details of how Bitcoin and other digital tokens work. The time I’ve spent grappling with the inner workings of virtual currencies has given me a sense of why so many computer scientists see the Bitcoin network as real technological innovation and not just a token that people buy and sell. I have a good stable of geeks who help walk me through the details when I get confused. And when I go to dinner parties it comes in handy — everyone these days wants to talk about how Bitcoin works and whether it is a bubble. But from that first article about the Winklevoss twins, I have tried to focus, whenever possible, on the real people who are buying and using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and what is motivating them. That has taken me to Argentina, where I saw how people are using virtual currencies to escape the inflation their local currency is experiencing. It has also led me to the online black markets, where virtual currencies have made it easier for addicts to buy deadly drugs from China and for criminals to collect ransom payments. It is also the real-world usage that tests whether Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are able to live up to the big promises that they are making. With most virtual currency projects, I’ve found that there are relatively few real-world transactions to back up the big, speculative bets that investors are making. Perhaps most fascinating is how these new currencies draw communities around them. It’s a potent reminder that all money is a social construct: The more people who believe a Bitcoin or dollar will retain its value in a week, the greater the value the currency will have. But these are still early days. The death of Bitcoin has been wrongfully proclaimed many times already. For my part, The Times’s rules against investing in what we write about has allowed me to be equally open to this going up or down. Beyond that, these virtual currencies are all living economics experiments, testing how different sorts of incentives create different behaviors. Bitcoin has an elaborate system of carrots and sticks designed to attract followers and to increase the cybersecurity of the Bitcoin network. But these incentives don’t always work as expected. That uncertainty is what makes it so interesting to watch — and to report on.",0.2245323529411765,0.12492466683643155

That’s the longest streak on record, surpassing the previous record of 394 trading days set in the mid-1990s. So when was the last time the market fell 5 percent from a recent high? The aftermath of Brexit in June 2016. Kate Kelly of NYT reports that six weeks after firing the former congressman Harold E. Ford Jr. for unspecified misconduct, Morgan Stanley has clarified that the misconduct was not sexual in nature. The statement is part of a legal settlement that Mr. Ford reached over the weekend with Morgan Stanley, according to a person who was briefed on the resolution but was not authorized to speak publicly. The broader contours of the settlement were unclear, including whether there was a financial component. Through a spokesman, Mr. Ford declined to comment. Before his firing last month, Mr. Ford had spent seven years at Morgan Stanley recruiting clients. He joined the investment banking industry after losing a United States Senate race in Tennessee as the Democratic nominee in 2006. Mr. Ford, 47, was fired after a female journalist told Morgan Stanley that he had harassed her at a dinner in 2014. At the time, Morgan Stanley said he had been fired “for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.” Some media reports of his firing said it had been triggered by the harassment allegation. Since Mr. Loeb’s Third Point emerged as an investor in the Swiss food giant, Nestlé has sold off its U.S. confectionary business, named new directors and bought Blue Bottle coffee. All of those have been great moves, according to the hedge fund. But there’s more to be done, Third Point wrote in its latest letter to investors. From the investor letter: What Third Point wants • Better demonstrate that the company is focused on “nutrition, health and wellness,” with the implication being to divest products like ice cream and frozen pizza. • Buy back more shares. • Again consider selling the L’Oreal stake, something Nestlé has been loath to do historically. — Michael J. de la Merced The father of Jared Kushner, who is again working at the family real estate business — this time without a title — told the WaPo in an interview that the Kushner Companies hasn’t been a target of the Russia investigation so far and hasn’t had problems getting financing.

Perhaps more notably, it shows that the biopharmaceutical company is still on the hunt for more acquisitions. Remember that earlier this month, Celgene agreed to pay up to $7 billion for Impact Biomedicines, which also makes a treatment for a kind of blood cancer. Celgene, which is based in Summit, N.J., already owns about 9.7 percent of Juno’s shares. Here’s what Mark Alles, Celgene’s C.E.O., said: “The acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers.” The details • Celgene would pay $87 a share in cash for each share of Juno. • Juno’s shares closed on Friday at $67.81, meaning the deal is at a 28 percent premium. • The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter.

(Manager, Mother Jones) The tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture. Improving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum. Yet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That’s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season. So what gives? The tax law. Large financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes: Exclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent. Two points of note: • “While some of the biggest banks are reporting fourth-quarter earnings hits stemming from the new tax law, they see rich benefits over the long term, including effective tax rates that are even lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate,” as NYT’s Jim Tankersley reported last week. • As the fourth-quarter earnings growth rate has fallen over the last week for S&P 500 companies, profit expectations for 2018 have risen. Here’s what Samidh Chakrabarti, a product manager at the tech giant, wrote in a post on the company’s Hard Questions blog: Mr. Chakrabarti added that while the company was slow to address Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it’s working to prevent it happening again.

382,There Is Nothing Virtual About Bitcoin’s Energy Appetite,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-21T22:22:17+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Creating a new Bitcoin requires electricity. A lot of it. In the virtual currency world this creation process is called “mining.” There is no physical digging, since Bitcoins are purely digital. But the computer power needed to create each digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry. The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries — which country depends on whose estimates you believe. And the network supporting Ethereum, the second-most valuable virtual currency, gobbles up another country’s worth of electricity each day. The energy consumption of these systems has risen as the prices of virtual currencies have skyrocketed, leading to a vigorous debate among Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts about burning so much electricity. The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is leading an experiment with a more energy-efficient way to create tokens, in part because of his concern about the impact that the network’s electricity use could have on global warming. “I would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus’s worth of electricity consumption to global warming,” Mr. Buterin said in an interview. But many virtual currency aficionados argue that the energy consumption is worth it for the grander cause of securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and making a new kind of financial infrastructure, free from the meddling of banks or governments. “The electricity usage is really essential,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a group that advocates for virtual currency technology. “Because of the costs, we know the only people participating are serious, that they are economically invested. That creates the incentives for cooperation.” This dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies. All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm. The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses. The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning. But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity. The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so. This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009. The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money. Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer. But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity. These days, the 12.5 Bitcoins that are handed out every 10 minutes or so are worth about $145,000, so people have been willing to invest astronomical sums to participate in this race, which has in turn made the race harder. This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin. This process is central to Bitcoin’s existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network. The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network. The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records. In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a “greedy attacker” who might want to alter the records and “defraud people by stealing back his payments.” Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker “ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.” The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going. Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work. But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it. For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble — or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments — any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it. But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge. In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency. And in countries with more stable economies, Bitcoin has led to a flurry of new investments, jobs and start-up companies. “Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog. The jobs alone, he added, “are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.” But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use. Mr. de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example. “Visa is more centralized,” Mr. de Vries said. “If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive. But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.” The figures published by Mr. de Vries have been criticized by Mr. Bevand and other Bitcoin fans, who say they overstate the energy costs by a factor of about three. Many critics add that producing and securing physical money and gold also require lots of energy, in some cases as much as or more than Bitcoin uses. Mr. Van Valkenburgh, of the Coin Center, has argued that Bitcoin miners, who can do the work anywhere, have an incentive to situate themselves near cheap, often green energy sources, especially now that coal-guzzling China appears to be exiting the mining business. Several mining companies have opened server farms near geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Washington State. But the concerns about electricity use have still hit home with many in the industry. The virtual currencies known as Ripple and Stellar, which were created after Bitcoin, were designed not to require electrically demanding mining. Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr. Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using. Known as “proof of stake,” it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins — their stake in the system. The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called “proof of work.” Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don’t need existing tokens. They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race. Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move. Mr. Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system. But it is far from clear that the method will be as secure as the one used by Bitcoin. Mr. Buterin has been fiercely attacked by Bitcoin advocates, who say his proposal will lose the qualities that make virtual currencies valuable. Mr. Van Valkenburgh said that for now, throwing lots of computing power into the mix — and the electricity that it burns — was the only proven solution to the problems Bitcoin solves. “At the moment, if you want robust security, you need proof of work,” he said.",0.1682846153846154,0.10967384282384283

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Good morning, readers! It was an interesting week in the tech world. Let’s get to the news. One thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale — the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don’t make for great optics. There’s a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites. Well, they want you to know they aren’t. Amazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday, the company announced the 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There’s one city in Canada — Toronto — and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there’s oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win. Meanwhile, in its own very well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money — the largest tax bill ever paid — and invest billions in new facilities and people in the United States. The company is also giving many of its employees a $2,500 bonus. Apple’s announcement made Trump very happy. And the president’s victory lap is, I think, somewhat deserved. Trump and the tech industry have not had the warmest relationship, but it’s clear that his campaign — in which he constantly harangued Apple and Amazon for perceived slights — has shaken the industry from its presumption that everyone in the country loves it. Just a few weeks ago, people brave enough to enter the market for Bitcoin and its many rival electronic currencies looked like lucky geniuses. They were suddenly making millions, even billions — and you were kicking yourself for overlooking the crypto boom. Well, now you’re the genius (if still poor). Much of the cryptocurrency market took a bath this week, with Bitcoin falling below $10,000 at one point, more than 50 percent off its December peak. Reddit was flooded with panicked crypto lovers, but, as it usually does, the market leveled off by the end of the week, and crypto-heads were professing to be back on board for the long haul. Godspeed, I guess. There wasn’t so much else in tech news this week, so take some time to read some great magazine stories. In Bloomberg Businessweek, Eric Newcomer and Brad Stone have a dishy inside look at how Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and former hard-charging C.E.O., fell from grace. Among the details: During one harrowing Kalanick-caused scandal, he fell to “his hands and knees and began squirming on the floor.” Also, Steven Johnson has a fascinating piece in The New York Times Magazine about the uses for the blockchain, the technology undergirding cryptocurrencies. And in The New Yorker, there’s a lovely ode to blogging and The Awl, a much-beloved Brooklyn web magazine that sadly called it quits this week. Speaking of quits: See you next week!

384,"When Trading in Bitcoin, Keep the Tax Man in Mind",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/your-money/bitcoin-irs-taxes.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-18T21:44:46+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Bitcoin may grab headlines when it skyrockets in value, as it did much of last year, or when it plunges precipitously, as it has this week. But the virtual currency has a reputation for providing a sense of anonymity to those who own it. That anonymity doesn’t extend to the tax authorities, however. Come April, people who have bought and sold Bitcoin — or any of the other digital currencies that have quickly sprouted across the web — will be expected to report any profits on their federal tax returns. Considering Bitcoin’s jump of more than 1,500 percent last year, there are probably many people who logged gains or losses for the first time, as people rushed in with the irrational exuberance of the early dot-com days. But how much tax you owe will depend on how and when you acquired the digital currency — which, in fact, isn’t treated as a currency at all. Instead, for tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service views Bitcoin and its cryptocoin cousins as property. For the most part, that means Bitcoin and other digital currencies will be treated similarly to an investment like stocks — but not always. Given the speed at which these currencies have caught on — Bitcoin was released only in 2009 — regulators haven’t quite kept pace. The I.R.S. issued basic guidelines in 2014 for digital currencies, but tax experts say some of the rules are subject to interpretation. Other aspects, however, are quite clear. “Every time you transfer a cryptocurrency, you might trigger a gain and pay a tax,” said Selva Ozelli, a tax lawyer and accountant who has recently written about the tax implications of virtual currencies. In late 2016, the I.R.S. made it clear that it was searching for cryptocurrency tax evaders: The agency sent a broad request to Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, requesting records for all customers who bought digital currency from the company from 2013 to 2015. Coinbase balked, but a court ruled that it must provide the records of roughly 14,000 customers, fewer than 1 percent of its patrons, who made transactions involving more than $20,000 of virtual currencies. “If you play audit roulette, you are a fool,” said Daniel Morris, an accountant with expertise in digital currencies. “If you made a single trade or more, report it.” Here are some basics about the tax implications of virtual currency: I sold some Bitcoin last year. What do I need to do? If you are holding Bitcoin as an investment, any gains or losses on the sale are treated as capital assets, like a stock or bond. The gain or loss is calculated against the market value of the currency when you acquired it (known as your basis). If you held the currency for more than a year, you qualify for the less onerous long-term capital gains rates (generally 0, 15 or 20 percent). Short-term gains, from digital coins held for a year or less, are taxed as ordinary income. As on the stock market, losses can be used to offset capital gains, subject to certain rules, and losses that are not used to offset gains can be deducted — up to $3,000 — from other kinds of income. Unused losses can be carried over to future years. I bought a computer (or another product or service) using Bitcoin. Are there tax implications? The short answer: Yes. More than 100,000 merchants worldwide accept Bitcoin, including big companies like Microsoft and Expedia, according to a 2017 report from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, a tax software and analysis firm. So, for instance, if you bought Bitcoin as an investment in  late 2013, when it was trading at around $1,000, and used it to buy a car when the currency was trading at $18,000, you would have a long-term capital gain of $17,000, explained Ryan Losi, an accountant and executive vice president at Piascik, a tax firm. Likewise, if you suffer a loss, that should also be reported on your tax return. I’ve successfully ‘mined’ Bitcoins. Now what? All Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger maintained by a decentralized network of computers. Mining refers to the process in which new Bitcoins are created and then awarded to the computers that are the first to process these transactions coming onto the network. The people whose computers do this most quickly collect a fresh helping of Bitcoins. These virtual miners must report the fair market value of the currency (on the day they received it) as gross income. Miners are also required to pay self-employment tax — that is, Social Security and Medicare taxes — if the mining “constitutes a trade or business,” according to the I.R.S. I was paid in Bitcoin. Are there any special tax consequences? Receiving wages from an employer in a virtual currency is like being paid in dollars: It is taxable to the employee, must be reported by the employer on a Form W-2 and is subject to federal income tax withholding, according to Wolters Kluwer. Independent contractors paid in digital currency must also treat that as gross income and pay self-employment taxes. What if I paid someone else in Bitcoin for their services? When you pay an independent worker (not on your payroll) in excess of $600 for services performed for your “trade or business,” that should be reported to the I.R.S. and the person receiving the payment (generally using Form 1099-MISC). The same rules apply when an individual is paid in virtual currency with an equivalent value. Can I reduce my tax bill by donating my cryptocoins? Potentially. Only people who itemize their tax returns can deduct their charitable contributions. But under the new tax code, far fewer people are likely to itemize starting with their 2018 return. For those who still itemize, it may be possible to directly donate their Bitcoin (or Ether, etc.), just as they can directly donate, say, highly appreciated stock — as long as the charity accepts it. For example, Fidelity Charitable, a donor-advised fund, allows people to give money, take a tax deduction in the same year, and then invest and allocate the money to select charities over time. Fidelity Charitable collected roughly $22 million in Bitcoin donations through early December; it works with Coinbase, the exchange, to immediately turn the Bitcoin or Ether into cash, which is then invested as its donor wishes. Will I receive any tax forms from my exchange? Do I have to track my own transactions? Generally speaking, brokers and exchanges are not yet required to report cryptocurrency transactions to the I.R.S., as they do when you sell a stock at a profit or loss (and you receive a 1099-B or a 1099-DIV for a mutual fund). But you will need to keep track of every move you make. Coinbase, for example, refers you to your account transaction history for records to compute your gains and losses; it also provides customers a “cost basis for taxes” report. One of the most common questions TurboTax received from its users was how and where to report their virtual currency transactions, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, an accountant with TurboTax. (Use Form 8949 to add it all up, and report it on Schedule D, along with any other capital gains.) Does the new tax bill change any of this? The bill eliminated what some interpreted to be a tax break for virtual currency holders. Under the old rules, some cryptocoin investors applied a legal maneuver often used with real estate investments to defer their capital gains. Under what is called a 1031 exchange, taxpayers can sell one property and defer taxes as long as the proceeds were reinvested in a similar, or “like-kind,” property and met certain requirements. The I.R.S. didn’t say this strategy could be used with virtual currencies, but some tax experts argued that it was a reasonable — albeit debatable — interpretation since the coins were considered property. Now that the tax legislation limits the use of 1031 exchanges to real estate, they no longer apply, accountants said. So … should I finally buy Bitcoin? Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, recently suggested asking yourself a different question: Does Bitcoin fit into my investment plan? Warren E. Buffett said he believed the cryptocurrency story would end badly, while Abigail Johnson, chief executive officer of Fidelity, called herself a believer. Whatever you decide, never gamble more than what you can afford to lose — and you’ll need to report it.",0.1521366666666667,0.07739381914381914

A decline in virtual currency prices that began before Christmas has picked up pace in recent days as concern has grown that governments could crack down on the new industry. For a time on Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin dipped below $10,000 — taking it down to about half what it was at its peak last month. Other virtual currencies have been falling even faster. Ripple, which was briefly second in value after Bitcoin, has lost more than two-thirds of its value from the high it hit early this month. The falling prices have been serious enough to prompt online posts with suicide hotlines for virtual currency investors in despair. The declines are likely to be particularly painful for people who took out debt to buy virtual currencies at high prices. Even the lows hit on Wednesday are still well up — some 1,000 percent — from where Bitcoin began 2017. But that is little comfort for the people who purchased late last year. One person on Reddit wrote about persuading family members to buy digital tokens late in 2017 and regretting it. “Fast forward to today,” the user, going by the screen name PM_ME_UR_ROOM_VIEW, wrote. “I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it’s just a correction and don’t sell but they aren’t listening.” For skeptics of virtual currencies, the falling prices have provided some vindication. “Most people are buying Bitcoin, not because of a belief in its future as a global currency, but because they expect it to rise in value,” a note from economists at Capital Economics said on Wednesday. “Accordingly, it has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble, which we expect to burst.” The pessimism in recent days has been fed by several reports that governments around the world were planning to tighten the reins on virtual currency trading. South Korean officials have said they were contemplating shutting down the virtual currency exchanges that have popped up over the past year. South Korea has seen the most frenzied surge of ordinary investors throwing their savings into Bitcoin and other digital tokens. The Chinese government has already shut down exchanges in China, but it was recently reported to be taking even further measures against new forms of online trading as well as Bitcoin mining operations in the country. Regulators in the United States have continued to crack down on smaller virtual currencies like Bitconnect, which has been described as a Ponzi scheme by many in the industry. Bitcoin, which began in 2009, has been through these sorts of wild swings before. The price spiked in late 2013 to above $1,000, before moves by the Chinese government sent the price sliding. It was only last year that the price again recovered to the same levels. Since that recovery, an array of virtual currencies have been on a nearly uninterrupted tear. With Bitcoin, investors have been betting that it could be a new kind of asset, outside the control of any government, something like digital gold. Investors have also been putting money into newer virtual currencies like Ethereum and Ripple, which were designed to do more sophisticated types of transactions than Bitcoin. The excitement has been amplified by hedge funds that were created in the last year to invest in virtual currencies and by Wall Street institutions that have expressed an interest. But investments in these new tokens have far outstripped their real-world use in the types of transactions for which they are intended. Ripple, for example, is supposed to help financial institutions transfer money across international borders. But only a few institutions have said they are using the currency, known as XRP, for that purpose. Some longtime virtual currency investors have said that a major price pullback was necessary after the hype had gotten so far ahead of the reality. “This is the ecosystem purging the ‘easy money’ crowd that arrived in past couple months,” Spencer Bogart, a partner with the hedge fund Blockchain Capital, wrote on Twitter. Prominent individual investors echoed that sentiment. “I usually recommend people to buy during dips like these if they were hesitant to enter the market before because you can get in on a discount,” said James Spediacci, who with his brother Julian runs an investment club for virtual currency investors. Monica Quaintance, lead engineer at a company working on technology related to digital currencies and an organizer of events for women interested in them, said investors should expect price volatility until there is strong government regulation. “People want to know that if they make a lot of money from Bitcoin they’re going to be able to keep the money,” Ms. Quaintance said. But for those less enamored of the technology, the declines are viewed as the beginning of an even steeper fall. “The latest price falls suggest that the bubble is bursting — although with prices still ten times higher than a year ago, they have a lot further to fall yet,” Capital Economics wrote.",0.08897027027027025,0.03428303303303303

Though the news accompanied the announcement that G.E. would take a $6.2 billion charge related to its legacy insurance portfolio, the statements are unrelated. The problem: Many on Wall Street think that Mr. Flannery was talking about the once-unfathomable idea that G.E. could be broken apart into separate businesses. On a conference call with analysts, Mr. Flannery said: Late last year, Mr. Flannery, who succeeded Jeff Immelt as C.E.O. in August, said he will make the company smaller by reducing the number of businesses it is in. He said that G.E. would focus on jet engines, power-generation equipment and health-care machines. The context: It’s unlikely that G.E. will make an announcement in the spring that it will only fiddle around the edges, like more fully spinning off its Baker Hughes oil-field services unit. But it’s also unlikely that Mr. Flannery will be the one to break up the 125-year-old conglomerate.

The petition to begin the lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court of Appeals in Washington, is the first legal challenge against the F.C.C.’s order in December. Several others are expected, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and Free Press, which argue that the F.C.C.’s order was harmful to consumers and was done hastily and without proper public input. The business that makes Butterfingers and Gobstoppers will find a new home — at Ferrero, the producer of Rocher chocolate — for $2.8 billion in cash. The numbers • The U.S. candy business, which doesn’t include KitKats, generated $900 million in sales in 2016. (That’s roughly 1 percent of Nestlé’s overall revenue that year.) • The deal is expected to close by March 31 The context: Nestlé said last year that it would explore a sale of the business amid a waning appetite among Americans for candy. The move had been lauded by Dan Loeb’s Third Point, which has put pressure on the food titan to sell off nonessential businesses. The pullquote, from Mark Schneider, Nestlé’s C.E.O.: The advisers For Ferrero: Credit Suisse, Lazard and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell — Michael J. de la Merced One of Elliott’s first campaigns of 2018 sees the activist hedge fund going even further abroad: Its latest target is Bezeq, the once-government-owned Israeli telecom company. The phone service provider is up 5 percent as of this morning on the news of Elliott’s investment and public letter to the telecom’s interim chairman, David Granot. The context  Bezeq has been under pressure on multiple fronts: • The company has been under pressure from regulators amid an investigation into potential securities violations, including an inquiry into the mogul Shaul Elovitch, who owns 26 percent of the company. • The company’s ownership structure is complicated. Technically, Mr. Elovitch controls Eurocom, which in turn controls Internet Gold, which in tern controls BCom, which in turn controls Bezeq. (Got that?) But Mr. Elovitch has been grappling with debt at Eurocom and is in talks to sell control of that vehicle to another businessman, Naty Saidoff. What Elliott wants • Replacing all directors under scrutiny by Israeli securities regulators, in consultation with shareholders • Simplifying the ownership structure of the company From the hedge fund’s letter to Mr. Granot: What could lie ahead Beyond the public pressure that the letter by Paul Singer’s hedge fund will bring, Elliott could also call a special meeting of shareholders to vote on matters like choosing new directors, if it can muster up the support of at least 5 percent of shares. (Elliott said that it currently owns a 4.8 percent economic interest in the company. ) — Michael J. de la Merced • It isn’t necessarily the $3.5 billion purchase price that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners agreed to pay for the operator of gift card stores. • It isn’t necessarily the 24 percent premium over Blackhawk’s Friday closing price that the $45.25-per-share bid represents. • It isn’t even necessarily the nine advisers listed in the press release. (More on that below.) • It’s the $1.7 billion equity check that Silver Lake is writing to support the deal. That’s one of the biggest-ever equity commitments that the $39 billion investment firm has ever made. The backstory Dan Primack has more on the five-year saga over at Axios. The advisers For Blackhawk: Sandler O’Neill & Partners, Citigroup and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz For Silver Lake: Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett For P2 Capital: The law firm Debevoise & Plimpton — Michael J. de la Merced The first Qualcomm unveiled its first official “fight letter” in its campaign to beat back Broadcom’s $105 billion bid for the chip maker. Among the highlights of the letter: • Qualcomm says that it will deliver between $6.75 and $7.50 in pro forma earnings per share for its 2019 fiscal year. • A pledge to continue the company’s its cost-savings program. • A reiteration that Broadcom’s offer ignores the upswing that the emerging 5G wireless standard will bring for Qualcomm’s stock. From the letter: The second Ramius, a money manager that owns stakes in both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors, said that it plans to reject Qualcomm’s $110-a-share bid for the smaller chip maker. The firm wants a deal done — but at a higher price. That follows the declaration of Elliott that NXP was worth $135 a share on a standalone basis. From Ramius’s news release: — Michael J. de la Merced Citigroup said that it earned $3.7 billion in its fourth quarter — if one excludes a $22 billion charge related to the tax overhaul. Here’s a look at its results by the numbers: • $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share. Citi’s loss in the fourth quarter, including the tax charge. It is the bank’s largest quarterly loss. The new tax law is causing large banks to report big one-time charges to their fourth-quarter results, but the legislation should benefit the banks over time. • $1.28. Its earnings per share excluding the tax hit. That beat the $1.19 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters and topped the $1.14 per share earned a year ago. • $17.26 billion. Citi’s revenue for the quarter, which exceeded the $17.01 it generated a year ago. • $19 billion. The amount of the $22 billion tax charge that came from writing down deferred-tax assets, which companies use to offset future tax bills. • $3 billion. The amount of the tax hit that came from a one-time charge on overseas earnings because of the new tax law. • $2.9 billion. The amount Citi generated in trading revenue, down 19 percent. JPMorgan reported a 17 percent drop on Friday. — Stephen Grocer Goldman’s commodity trading revenue fell 75 percent last year, its worst annual performance, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter. Goldman reports earnings tomorrow before the bell. — Stephen Grocer The Dow Jones industrial average is trading above 26,000 for the first time. It took just seven days for the blue-chip index to go from 25,000 to 26,000. If it closes above that level, it will mark the quickest move from one millennial marker to the next. The previous record was set on Jan. 4 when the Dow finished above 25,000 just 23 trading sessions after surpassing 24,000. Of course, 1,000 point moves aren’t what they used to be. Going from 25,000 to 26,000 is a move of just 4 percent. By comparison, when the index went from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 days in 1999, it was a rise of 10 percent, points out the WSJ’s Erik Holm. And it’s not just the Dow that is surging this month. The more widely followed Standard & Poor’s 500 index crossed 2,800 this morning and is up more than 4 percent this month. That puts it on pace for its best monthly performance since March 2016, when it was rebounding from the steep sell-off during the first six weeks of that year. In fact, the S.&P. 500 hasn’t experienced a monthly decline since March of last year. — Stephen Grocer In a letter to investors, the hedge fund manager wrote that his firm had bought shares of Twitter in the fourth-quarter at an average price of $21.59. Via ValueWalk: Shares of Twitter are down about 1 percent to $25.13. — Stephen Grocer What’s happening: Larry Fink of BlackRock is sending a letter to C.E.O.s of public companies today saying that they must show how they contribute to society, or risk losing the money-management firm’s support. More from the letter: The leverage: BlackRock has $6 trillion under management, making it the biggest investor in public companies in the world. The context, from Andrew’s latest DealBook column: Mr. Fink’s letter pits the investment mogul “against many of the companies that he’s invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.” The assessment: Jeff Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management told Andrew, “It is huge for an institutional investor to take this position across its portfolio.” Mr. Sonnenfeld added that he’s seen “nothing like it.” More in corporate social activism  • Citi said it would measure, publish and address gaps in the pay between male and female employees in the U.S., Britain and Germany, after pressure from an investor. (Bloomberg) Raine — the merchant bank that invested early in Vice and counts Masa Son and Steve Ballmer as clients — has invested in Propagate Content, the studio that produced the first original series for Apple and Twitter. (Propagate’s co-founders are Ben Silverman, once co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, and Howard T. Owens, who was president of National Geographic Channels.) The thesis: That content is more important than ever in an era of online streaming. Raine’s betting that Propagate, which is also turning popular podcasts like “Lore” into streaming series and working on content for Netflix and CBS, can produce hits from a variety of sources and replicate them around the world.

388,Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-16T10:00:27+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"The sequence of words is meaningless: a random array strung together by an algorithm let loose in an English dictionary. What makes them valuable is that they’ve been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they’re known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps. On the screen, I’m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters: This is what’s called a “private key” in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there’s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location. That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string: That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction — say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum — that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of “blocks” of data, that record is called the blockchain. The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening — something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I’ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness. And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum’s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened. Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one “coin” of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later. You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether’s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn’t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment? But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it’s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook. The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet’s roots. Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia — there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems — but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress. Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. “We have to fix the internet,” Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs’s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. “After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.” The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: “The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.” In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: “Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google’s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.” (Full disclosure: Burnham’s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where “misinformation, or ‘fake news,’ which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.” For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools — turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media — or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft’s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware — the web, open-source software and Apple products — that helped undermine Microsoft’s dominant position. The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today’s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons. That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure. To some students of modern technological history, the internet’s fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, “The Master Switch,” all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon — and indirectly, Apple — what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism. Blockchain advocates don’t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties. To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet’s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services — Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter — that largely came to power in the following decade. The first layer — call it InternetOne — was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don’t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don’t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don’t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don’t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history. To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pokémon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts. But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky. But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it’s a problem we don’t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation. The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-’90s, we’ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 — many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms — were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo. For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined — pages, links, messages — but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online. This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It’s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as “base-layer” infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don’t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities — most of them backed by the power of the state — that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know. The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call “increasing returns” or “network effects” kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world’s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today — and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation. If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there’s less reason to fret about all the ways we’ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we’re living in a fallen state today and there’s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there’s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It’s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” You can’t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power. But the thing about the master’s house, in this analogy, is that it’s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better. One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet’s organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words “Welcome to Rivendell” were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from “Lord of the Rings.” “We call this house Rivendell,” Benet said sheepishly. “It’s not a very good Rivendell. It doesn’t have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.” Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet’s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype. Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as “the ‘summer’ of peer-to-peer” — its salad days. “But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,” he said. “And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.” A graduate of Stanford’s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he’s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. “The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,” he said. “The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.” He continued: “It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it’s now your turn to protect it.” Protocol Labs is Benet’s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet’s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol — HTTP — pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call “historic versioning,” so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) “Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,” Benet said. “So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.” But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet’s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come. Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn’t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company’s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders. And yet — as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out — there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. “Let’s say you’re trying to build an open Twitter,” Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. “I’m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.” A closed architecture like Facebook’s or Twitter’s puts all the information about its users — their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network — into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you. Running Facebook’s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook’s point of view, they’re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service — and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world — is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people — much less two billion — was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore. So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem — the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards — turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can’t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we’re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers’ markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo. The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres — one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook. The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain. History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a “peer-to-peer electronic-cash system” in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features. First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database — the blockchain — scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data. Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer’s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right — and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists — you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called “mining.” For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being “in charge” of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn’t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter. These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune. These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet’s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a “presale” of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O. The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor — in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network’s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network. Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of “tokens,” not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn’t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. “I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it’s like an arcade,” he says. “You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we’re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It’s not meant to be a real currency; it’s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.” Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon’s argument. “To me, what’s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,” he says. “They don’t have to resemble money.” Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. “I hate it,” Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s “are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.” Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s — and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether — is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson’s partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. “Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,” Burnham says. “Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map — and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.” But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there’s a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. “At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,” Burnham says. The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there’s a case to be made for adding another “basic layer” to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users’ past trips, credit cards, favorite locations — all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn’t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you’d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train. How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft. As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value. “You think about the ’90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,” Dixon says. “You’re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.” Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. “How can we fix the internet if we can’t even make coffee?” she said with a laugh. Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone’s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta’s, “headquarters” seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers’ collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum’s smart contracts into their own systems. The true test of the blockchain will revolve — like so many of the online crises of the past few years — around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don’t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn’t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can’t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same). The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity — which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history — and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of “self-sovereign” identity — as the parlance has it — was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet. What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu’s Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn’t present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I’d be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether. Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. “There may be many corporate entities that I don’t want seeing that data, but maybe I’d like to donate that data to a medical study,” she says. “I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.” The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook’s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. “If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,” Dixon says, “that could be pretty compelling.” Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. “Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,” Dixon says. “That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a ‘bug bounty’ is? Someone says, ‘If you hack my system, I’ll give you a million dollars.’ So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one’s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.” Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity — your social connections, your purchasing history — could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users — what security experts call “honey pots” — is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sniﬃng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, “It’s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.” So much of the blockchain’s architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line. Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (“self-sovereign”) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age. The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have “a right to a private data store,” where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn’t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state. Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical — almost communitarian — possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don’t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago. Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can’t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.",0.2032543209876543,0.07344339462753263
389,JPMorgan Chase Moves to Be First Big U.S. Bank With Its Own Cryptocurrency,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2019-02-14,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"In 2017, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, declared Bitcoin a “fraud” and said that any employee caught trading it would be fired for being “stupid.” On Thursday, JPMorgan became the first major United States bank to introduce its own digital token for real-world use, the latest step in Wall Street’s evolving approach to the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Despite questioning Bitcoin’s legitimacy, Mr. Dimon has said he recognizes blockchain’s potential in the future of the global financial system. And JPMorgan has already released a blockchain platform, Quorum, that several institutions are using to keep track of financial data. With the announcement of its coin, JPMorgan is widening its experiment and moving to make the idea of digital currencies more palatable to its typically risk-averse corporate customers. “Clients engaged us, saying they need a way to move money onto the blockchain,” Umar Farooq, who leads JPMorgan’s blockchain efforts, said in a telephone interview. The bank’s token is unlikely to shake up the financial system anytime soon. Because it will be run by JPMorgan, it lacks the fundamental qualities that have made cryptocurrencies so radical: the freedom from middlemen and from regulatory oversight. JPMorgan will control the JPM Coin ledger, and each coin will be backed by a dollar in JPMorgan accounts, giving the coins a stable value. That means JPM Coin will not be subject to the wild price volatility that has drawn speculators to other cryptocurrencies. The bank is following in the footsteps of several smaller players that have introduced similar digital coins tied to the dollar. A consortium of European banks has been finalizing a similar product, Utility Settlement Coin, that would make it possible to move money between banks more quickly. Several cryptocurrency exchanges already have their own so-called stablecoins. JPMorgan’s version will be less useful than other similar products because it will not be possible to move it outside the firm’s own systems, at least initially. What’s more, it is still just being tested and is not available to clients yet. But the entry of a major Wall Street bank into the market shows the mundane ways in which cryptocurrency technology has begun to gain traction in the traditional financial system a year after the prices of Bitcoin and other digital tokens crashed in spectacular fashion. The firm said it began working last year on what became JPM Coin to help its big customers, including major corporations and other banks, move money quickly and securely. (JPMorgan says it provides banking services for about 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies.) Essentially, when customers want to move dollars using the bank’s blockchain system, money in their JPMorgan accounts will be converted into JPM Coins, each one backed by a dollar in JPMorgan’s accounts. The token will be able to move nearly instantaneously on the coin’s ledger, which will initially be based on JPMorgan’s Quorum blockchain. Once transfers are competed, the coins can be converted back to dollars. The advantage of such a token, Mr. Farooq said, is speed. Clients that want to move huge sums of money would traditionally need to do so via wire transfer, a process that could take hours or even days. With international transfers, changes in currency exchange rates during the long lag times could end up adding to customers’ costs. Mr. Farooq said JPMorgan’s offering would be useful for big clients, but not for the smaller speculators who have typically taken an interest in cryptocurrencies. “This is designed specifically for institutional use cases on blockchain,” he said. “It’s not created to be for public investment.” Skeptics questioned why a blockchain ledger was necessary to move money between JPMorgan bank accounts. “JPMorgan’s choice to issue a stablecoin on a closed blockchain is not a new concept,” said Lawson Baker, the founder of Relayzero, a fund that invests in blockchain projects. “It is very similar to corporations’ desires to launch intranets as competition to the open internet system in the 1990s.” Generally, blockchains are employed when companies want to move data or money between institutions that might otherwise have trouble reconciling accounts. Blockchain technology allows multiple computers to keep a shared set of records. JPMorgan said it hoped to increase its coin’s versatility. Over time, for instance, it could be expanded to represent currencies beyond the dollar. First, though, the testing phase must be competed. After that, JPMorgan plans to work with regulators to gain permission for broader uses of JPM Coin. That process could take at least several months, Mr. Farooq said.",0.15434054054054053,0.027189413439413442
390,Will Cryptocurrencies Be the Art Market’s Next Big Thing?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/arts/cryptocurrency-art-market.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-13T11:28:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"LONDON — There’s a new gold rush. But this precious metal doesn’t actually exist. The frenzy is for so-called cryptocurrencies — or encrypted digital money — and their value skyrocketed in 2017. The price of Bitcoin, the pioneer decentralized virtual currency, rose more than 1,300 percent last year, despite plunging 40 percent at one point in December. A Bitcoin rival, Ether, was up 8,000 percent. It is thought that the total worldwide value of cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion this year. Bitcoin and its derivatives have, for the moment, proved too volatile and unwieldy for day-to-day transactions. Yet the cryptocurrency model, underpinned by decentralized blockchain ledger technology, is increasingly becoming a force in more specialized areas of the economy. The art world is one of them. On Dec. 16, the nascent market for what might be called cryptoart appeared to reach a new level when the hitherto-unknown Distributed Gallery announced the auction of “Ready Made Token,” a unique unit of a cryptocurrency that the gallery said was created by Richard Prince using technology from Ethereum, the network responsible for Ether. The online gallery describes itself as the first to specialize in “blockchain-based artwork and exhibition.” It invited bids for the work, starting at one Ether, equivalent to about $650 at the time. (As of Friday, one Ether was worth about $1,200, according to ethereumprice.org.) The timed auction ends on Monday. The appearance of a crypto “ready-made” by an artist of Mr. Prince’s stature seemed to suddenly put blockchain on the art world map. Distributed Gallery even arranged for Mr. Prince to attend the inaugural Rare Digital Art Festival in New York on Saturday. But when buying into the world of cryptocurrencies, it can be difficult to determine what is real. Consider this Twitter post from Mr. Prince on Jan. 6: In fact, Distributed Gallery had no connection with the American artist. This virtual dealership and its “Ready Made Token” are instead a playful experiment devised by Olivier Sarrouy, a philosophy and sociology lecturer at the University Rennes 2 in France, along with three friends. “We were trying to explore how a cryptocurrency could relate to scarcity in the art market,” Mr. Sarrouy, 32, said in a telephone interview. “It reinterpreted Marcel Duchamp’s gesture of the ready-made in a radical way.” But why Richard Prince? “To make a ready-made we needed a signature, but we were no one in the art world,” Mr. Sarrouy said, adding that he and his friends had chosen Richard Prince “because he is the king of appropriation art.” “Our artwork has been created by our own Richard Prince,” he said. “And then there is the famous Richard Prince.” The appropriation of this name was certainly mischievous, given that the “famous” Richard Prince continues to be involved in a lawsuit concerning his appropriation of an Instagram-sourced photograph for a 2014 exhibition. Adding further confusion, Mr. Prince’s most recent show of paintings at the Gladstone Gallery was titled “Ripple,” which also happens to the name of a high-rising cryptocurrency. Mr. Prince declined to comment for this column. “The project is interesting,” said Judy Mam, an organizer of the Rare Digital Art Festival, referring to the Distributed Gallery’s Duchampian token. “But we’re talking about people who are putting up money,” she added. “That’s when the theoretical aspect of the project comes crashing down.” It no longer features in the festival program. As of Wednesday, Distributed Gallery’s auction had attracted four participants, who bid in Ether up to a value of about $2,600. Three bidders who thought they were competing for a work by the “famous” Mr. Prince have received or are in the process of receiving a refund, according to Mr. Sarrouy. “The last one has bet knowing what this project was all about,” he said, “and is still the highest bidder.” Meanwhile, delegates at the Rare Digital Art Festival planned to discuss how to take memes and the other infinitely copyable stuff of the internet and turn them into “rare, tradable blockchain assets.” Since late November, the most spectacular proof of this concept has been CryptoKitties. These cute virtual felines have a collectibility — and tradeability — that has attracted more than 235,000 registered users and more than 37,000 Ether, or about $52 million in transactions, according to the company. Cryptokitties.co charges 3.75 percent every time a cat “breeds” with another or is sold in its own marketplace. In December, one of the 100 “Founder Cats” traded for 253.3368 Ether, equivalent at the time to about $111,000. (It would now be more than $300,000.) Mack Flavelle, co-founder of CryptoKitties, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, thinks that digital art could be a major beneficiary of the explosion in virtual wealth. “There’s not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,” said Mr. Flavelle, 37, who planned to attend the festival on Saturday. “We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum. It’s early days, but this could happen in the blossoming art space as well. The blockchain is an entirely new medium for art.” Matt Hall and John Watkinson, creators of CryptoPunks, also plan to be at the festival. CryptoPunks are 10,000 unique algorithm-generated characters, 9,000 of which were given away in June 2017 for collecting and trading on the Ethereum platform. Coveted “punks” are now selling for 10 Ether, or about $13,500 as of Wednesday, lifting the investment value of the founders’ retained 10 percent. Being pegged to cryptocurrencies, digital collectibles have risen (and fallen) in value at a far faster rate than just about everything in the analogue art world. They can be bought for a few dollars and sold for nominal fees. There’s no need to enter the intimidating world of galleries and auction houses to acquire them. True, the buyer doesn’t get to own a physical work of art, but then consumer research increasingly reveals that millennials are less hung up about possession. “If you can create a market for kittens, you can do it for digital art,” said Anders Petterson, author of the Hiscox Online Art Trade Report. “Millennials are comfortable with this kind of technology. There is the potential to open up an entire new ecosystem outside the traditional art world.” Plenty of people think cryptocurrencies will collapse under the weight of financial speculation. But if they don’t, they might just turn out to be the art world’s big game-changer.",0.13887068965517244,0.12235610414489724
391,Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You’re Not,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-13T11:00:41+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There’s a surge in people looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, its stock rose 500 percent in a day. In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it’s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys. The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order. The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than 13 million accounts that own cryptocurrencies. Data suggests that about 94 percent of the Bitcoin wealth is held by men, and some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners. There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize. They also remember who laughed at them and when. James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether. “One like,” he said, pointing to his phone. “It got one like.” Whether it’s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There’s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers. Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn’t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week. “I do I.C.O.s. It’s my thing,” he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. “It’s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.” An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an “Augur token” that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the value of Augur, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion. About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner’s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. “You can I.C.O. anything,” he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced “awesome”). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes. “They’re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,” he said. “But for me, it’s too early in my career to check out.” He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (Mayan Warrior) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. “I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it’s gone up six x since then,” he said. He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all. A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he’d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: “Probably not,” he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he’s skeptical that it can add to his life. “I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,” he said. A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest. “Nothing feels real, it doesn’t feel real,” he said. “I’m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I’ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.” Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse. Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital. “My neurons are fried from all the volatility,” Mr. Hummer said. “I don’t even care at this point. I’m numb to it. I’ll lose a million dollars in a day and I’m like, O.K.” His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, ‘The Lizard of Wall Street,’ with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, “memento mori,” to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse. “The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,” Mr. Hummer said. ""It’s almost like the ultimate short trade.” Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency. He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn’t give specifics other than to say he’d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There’s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they’ll be targeted and robbed since there’s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don’t know how much they’ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course. “It’s unforgiving,” Mr. Buttram said. “You make one mistake and it’s all gone.” They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency’s founder frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini. Mr. Buttram says he’s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin “B” necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL. This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, “hold” typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don’t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically. “HODL when everyone has FUD,” Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. “This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.” He knows this is strange. “When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,” Mr. Hummer said. “It’s just a different level of consciousness.” The tone turns somber. “Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,” Mr. Buttram said. Mr. Hummer said, “A bomb would set back civilization for years.” A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder’s apartment. James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for “going full YOLO” and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him. “I’m taking over her education,” Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms. Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers. “It’s the entire world reorganizing itself,” Mr. Fickel said. “We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you’ll have people saying, ‘I want to vote for a global order.’ It’s the internet waking up — it’s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That’s the blockchain.” Mr. Hummer is skeptical. “All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,” Mr. Hummer said. At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel’s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum. “I’m retired, man,” Mr. Chen said. “I’m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.” “Don’t say I’m retired,” he added. “I’m going into business now. I’m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.” Nearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group. “Obviously the bubble’s going to burst and everyone’s going to need a lawyer,” she said. At the annual San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup Party, hundreds gathered under the fluorescent lights of a co-working space, and there was a line out the door. The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from Hodlmoon, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters. Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He’s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology. “The technology still needs time to evolve,” Mr. Wuille said. ""This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can’t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.” He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. “I tell them I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know!” “There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that,” said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. “But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.” As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform. Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said. He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.” He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.” Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news. She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her. “Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. ""And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.” She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this. “And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.” She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.",0.056464367816091945,0.040069973130317946
392,Blockchain or Blockheads? Bitcoin Mania Mints Believers and Skeptics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/blockchain-blockheads-bitcoin-mania.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-12T17:13:36+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Sometimes life shows you what absurd really is. This is one of those times. I’m talking about the phenomenon known as Bitcoin, a monetary system based on computation, complex algorithms and — let’s face it — communal delusion. You’ve probably heard about this funny money, digital tokens that can be sent securely from computer to computer, with records kept through an online accounting system known as blockchain. (My colleague Nathaniel Popper has been writing great stuff about it.) Millions of people now have accounts with Coinbase, the leading marketplace for digital currencies. And the rush into the market has helped push prices up. At the beginning of last year, you could pick up a Bitcoin (not literally, because they’re virtual, DUH) for about a thousand bucks. Its gyrations briefly brought its price near $20,000, according to Blockchain.info, which tracks such things. So what’s the problem? Let me answer that question with a question: What do you know about tulips? Yes, I am referring to the Dutch tulip craze back in the 17th century, and the speculative bubble that preceded the stock market crash of 1929, and the dot-com boom and crash that started in the late 1990s. Remember that last one, when learned analysts told us that advancing technology had eliminated the business cycle? Good times. No bubble is too big to burst. But hey, no regrets! Carpe Bitcoin! (But not literally.) Signs of a bubble seem to be everywhere in the Bitcoin world today. Companies are trying to cash in by sprinkling themselves with a little Bitcoin fairy dust. Take the company called Long Island Iced Tea, which makes, you know, tea. The price of its shares nearly doubled one day last month after it announced that it would change its name to “Long Blockchain Corp.” The company’s announcement claimed it would “pursue opportunities” in blockchain technology. Which makes it sound as if some of those teas they brew are highly caffeinated. Or that people are indulging in that other kind of Long Island Iced Tea. I called Christian Day, a professor at Syracuse University law school who has written about bubbles and panics. He said that comparing Bitcoin to the tulip craze was unfair to tulips: “The Dutch were not as crazy as they’ve been portrayed.” For one thing, the tulip bulbs were real, he said, and the hybrids that were the subject of speculation could be extremely valuable. What’s more, much of the trading was done by people who knew their horticulture. With the modern techno-tulips, he said, “I don’t think there’s anything there.” Some of the most skeptical folks are experts in cryptography and computer security. Steven Bellovin, an adept in computer security and a professor at Columbia University, told me that the technology is still too buggy, “a lab experiment that escaped into the wild.” It’s hard to trust a currency, he said, that’s “backed by the full faith and credit of software that has to be updated monthly.” Another security expert, Matt Blaze, recently tweeted, “Cryptocurrency somehow combines everything we love about religious fanatics with everything we love about Ponzi schemes.” Ouch, currency guys. Well, you can afford some very expensive salves for those burns. For now. For another point of view — because I’m all about even-handedness, people! — I checked with Jim Harper, executive vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and says the promise of Bitcoin is to create a payment system people can use anywhere in the world with privacy and security. He says its true value will be in commerce, not speculation. Well, that hasn’t happened yet; the price is too unstable. He said the currency will move beyond some of the early notorious uses in illegal commerce. As for the tulip comparisons, he joked, “Laugh all you want: My initial coin offering for cryptotulips will be worth billions!” I have discovered that the cryptocurrency revolution has reached my own family. My 22-year-old son told me that he had tried to buy a bit of a Bitcoin a few weeks ago and actually lost the money. It was his cash to spend, so there was no lecturing him about it. But I did ask why he had tried to invest in Bitcoin when he’s shown little interest in, say, mutual funds. He said that he had been unaware of the speculation in Bitcoin. Instead, he said, he was trying to use it for precisely what Mr. Harper says it will be best for: currency transactions with vendors who do not accept, for example, debit cards or PayPal. “What I was actually trying to do was buy porn,” he said patiently. “From Japan.” As I said, he’s a millennial, full of that generation’s bracing honesty. I’m glad he told me, but I sure don’t need to know more about the particular transaction, except for the clarifying fact that this vendor would take Bitcoin. He said he followed the instructions and created a “wallet” and went to an exchange and, after entering a great deal of personal information, bought a small fraction of a bitcoin — in fact, 0.005 of one, “the lowest quantity you could purchase” on the site. Then he found that he couldn’t figure out how to get to his money, grew frustrated and gave up. Well, I told him, losing 70 bucks is hardly ruinous; it’s more like the cost of an education. As we discussed the aborted transaction, he grabbed his laptop and took another look at the exchange site. “Oh,” he said. “I got in.” A calmer state of mind had led to success. The result? “I’ve got 0.00545679 Bitcoin,” he said, reading off the screen, “which is now worth … $96.” In the time the money had been locked up, it had jumped in value by about a third. “This has been a profitable evening!” Tell me about it. In sheer percentage terms, his little investment outperformed my 401(k)’s return for an entire year. Now I am trying to figure out how to cash in on all of this, though without buying Bitcoin myself. It’s exactly the kind of market that a fool like me might be tempted to rush into, but I’ve learned enough over the years to know that by the time I finally try the hot new thing, it is already cold and old. I am the maker of markets, the loser who helps to create winners. Instead, maybe I’ll just pull a Long Island Iced Tea and change my name to Blockchain Schwartz. It has a nice ring to it! But that’s just a start. I think I’ll write all of my articles from now on in an encrypted form and publish them via blockchain. This means, unfortunately, that no one will be able to read them. You may say that nobody can read your stuff anyway! You can be cruel, reader. But I say that the exclusivity and security built into my cryptoprose will make each article surge in value.

393,New Facebook Should Benefit Investors Long Term: DealBook Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-fixed-income-wall-street.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-12T13:01:21+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Are Facebook’s changes good for investors? • JPMorgan’s earnings beat can’t mask Wall Street’s malaise. • JPMorgan takes hit tied to Steinhoff’s woes. • U.S. Supreme Court will hear a challenge to S.E.C.’s in-house judges. • BlackRock is now a $6 trillion firm. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Robert Cyran of Breakingviews argues that the answer is yes, at least in the long run. Here’s his point:  The highlights from the big bank’s latest earnings release: • $4.2 billion in net income for the fourth quarter, down 34 percent because of $2.4 billion worth of charges related to the new tax law. • Excluding the tax-related charges, the bank earned $1.76 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.69. • Investment banking revenue was up 10 percent, at $1.6 billion. • Fixed-income trading was down 34 percent, while stock markets revenue was flat. The bigger picture The onetime engine of Wall Street’s enviable performance, fixed-income trading, is still sputtering, thanks to new regulations, disruptive technologies and calmer markets. More from Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly in the NYT: Tucked into JPMorgan's earnings this morning was a $143 million mark-to-market loss the bank disclosed on a “margin loan to a single client.” That client is Steinhoff International Holdings, according to reports. Early last month the giant South African retailer, which owns American mattress maker Sleepy’s, said it had discovered accounting irregularities. Its shares tumbled 78 percent on the news. How does this effect J.P. Morgan? The bank was not among the initial group of lenders on the margin loan “to an entity controlled by Steinhoff’s then chairman Christo Wiese to purchase additional shares in the company in the fall of 2016.” But, as the WSJ reports, “losses from the margin loan were expected to have been spread among a wider group of banks.” How often does the Supreme Court agree to review a decision in which the two sides agree the lower court was wrong? That odd situation will play out in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission in which the justices will consider whether administrative law judges used by the S.E.C. are “officers” under the Constitution Appointments Clause. If they are, then they can only be put in office by the president, a head of a department, or the judiciary. This obscure provision burst on the scene about two years ago when defendants challenged how the S.E.C. picked its in-house judges [link below]. The S.E.C. became more aggressive in pursuing administrative cases in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law expanded the S.E.C.’s authority to bring most cases in its administrative court rather than going into a federal district court, depriving defendants of discovery rights and a jury to decide the case. Defendants argued the judges are not mere employees but “officers” so the proceeding was unconstitutional. Needless to say, the S.E.C. disagreed and argued before the appeals courts that there was no issue regarding their constitutional status. The S.E.C. won the case before the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. but lost in the Tenth Circuit. Then the Justice Department flipped the script. In late November, the solicitor general’s office filed a brief [link below] with the Supreme Court stating that the judges had not been properly appointed because they are “officers” under the Constitution. The key issue is whether other agencies beyond the S.E.C. that use in-house judges will also have to change how they are appointed. The impact of the decision could be significant if previously decided cases will have to be reheard before a properly appointed judge, creating a mess that could take years to sort out. -- Peter J. Henning Continuing to cash in on the boom in exchange-traded funds, the world’s largest money manager ended 2017 with $6.3 trillion under management up 22 percent for the year. BlackRock reported adjusted net earnings of $3.7 billion for the year on Friday, up 16 percent for the year and easily beating analyst expectations. The firm also reported a $1.2 billion tax benefit for the fourth quarter, resulting from the recent tax cut package. Including the tax benefit, earnings were up 59 percent for the year. BlackRock has been one of the main beneficiaries of the current bull market. Money has flowed over the past nine years into passive investment funds that track a wide variety of indexes and strategies at minimal cost. Of the $367 billion in net inflows that BlackRock took in last year, $245 billion came via the firm’s iShares suite of E.T.F.s. Increasingly investors are using E.T.F.’s to make bets on the stock and bond markets as opposed to buying the individual securities themselves. — Landon Thomas Jr. The famous oilman and investment manager is shutting his energy-focused hedge fund as his health declines, the WSJ reports. Mr. Pickens wrote in a letter that he plans to publish soon and was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal: Yesterday morning, six senators looked near a bipartisan deal on how to protect the class of young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. That would have pleased the 142 business leaders who had pleaded for one. Then “shithole” happened. Leaving aside the controversy over the vulgarity, President Trump’s reported remarks — which he says weren’t quite like that — exposed his skepticism about the contours of a proposal presented to him by the senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. Democrats want a clean bill to protect the immigrants, but Mr. Trump questioned why immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa should be protected too. Other Republicans expressed skepticism as well. Senator John Cornyn of Texas said, “We need to have more than six votes for a proposal.” The Washington flyaround • Inside the fractious relationship between the president and his party.

The $300 million bill for the new hourly rate amounts to “just 0.3 percent of the company’s sales and administration costs.” One analyst calculated Walmart’s overall tax savings at about $2.2 billion. • Critics pointed out that Walmart would probably have had to raise wages anyway, given the tight labor market and competition from rivals like Target. • Walmart said it was closing 63 Sam’s Club stores, and trying to find jobs for affected employees.

One big question: What will Dropbox be valued at? Private market investors reckoned $10 billion. And can it command a higher valuation than its rival Box? What’s next: Dropbox has already hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as underwriters, and will appoint more. It will then work on formalizing its prospectus and arrange meetings with analysts and, eventually, prospective investors. The other big question: Will Dropbox be more like Stitch Fix (up 66 percent since its I.P.O.) or Snap (down 40 percent)? What to expect: More status updates by family or photos of your friend’s Bernese mountain dog. And fewer posts by publishers.

394,Why Is South Korea Spooking the Global Bitcoin Market?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/south-korea-bitcoin-ban.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-12T12:13:59+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SEOUL, South Korea — The world of Bitcoin — rarely free of wild ups and downs of late — has been rattled this week by word that South Korea is preparing a ban on trading in virtual currencies. The question is how real that threat might be. South Koreans have taken to digital tokens with fervor. The worldwide virtual currency boom that started last year has swept up savers young and old in South Korea, helping push up global prices. The government has expressed alarm. Officials, including the prime minister, have voiced concerns about an irrational frenzy. Raids by South Korean tax officials on digital currency exchanges this week have added to unease among investors. “I am so nervous,” said Kim Su-jin, a 50-year-old investor in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies who works as a bookkeeper at a women’s clothing store in Seoul. “My coins could become trash if the government closes the exchanges.” But South Korea does not appear to be done with cryptocurrencies quite yet. Several political leaders have already aired their opposition to a ban on Bitcoin trades, indicating that the public enthusiasm for virtual currencies just might be strong enough to shield them from further government intervention. The country’s justice minister, Park Sang-ki, said this week that his ministry was drawing up a bill that would include the complete shutdown of virtual currency exchanges, adding that trading in the tokens “has started to resemble gambling and speculation.” The most popular Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea process hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions every day. Trades using the Korean won account for around 5 percent of the volume of Bitcoin trades globally. For now, the authorities do not appear to be of one mind on the subject. After Mr. Park’s comments on Thursday, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in clarified that the Justice Ministry’s plan was not final, according to the Yonhap news agency. Then, on Friday, Kim Dong-yeon, the finance minister, emphasized that other ministries would be expected to confer on the Justice Ministry’s proposal, Yonhap reported. At the very least, a ban would not be passed quickly: Securing a majority of votes in the National Assembly could take months. More to the point, several lawmakers from major parties signaled this week that they would not support a crackdown. Park Young-sun, a member of the governing party who has no relation to the justice minister, wrote on her Facebook page that closing the exchanges would be like “setting fire to a straw-roofed house to catch a bedbug.” Ha Tae-kyung, a legislator with the opposition Bareun Party, wrote on Facebook that criminalizing virtual currencies would fly in the face of the administration’s claims to support new technologies. South Korean citizens have also voiced their opposition to a potential clampdown by signing petitions with the president’s office. The most popular of these has garnered more than 120,000 signatures. “The power of the individual investor is very huge in South Korea,” said Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Hashed, a fund in Seoul that invests in virtual currency projects. The National Tax Service in South Korea declined to comment on why its representatives visited two major virtual currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, this week. But Shin Won-hee, head of operations at Coinone, said the tax authorities had wanted to check that the company had paid proper corporate tax. Bithumb told local news outlets that it was cooperating with the investigation. Separately, the police in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, have been investigating whether Coinone is operating “a gambling site.” The company had previously allowed investors to buy and sell virtual currencies on margin — that is, to place bets using borrowed money. But Mr. Shin said that Coinone decided in November to stop allowing margin trading as government officials began expressing concerns about market overheating. Mr. Park, the justice minister, said this week that the depths of South Korean investors’ irrationality was reflected in the high premium — around 30 percent on Friday — that they paid on Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea over those elsewhere. Experts said that South Korean prices were also higher because the exchanges there did not allow trading by foreigners. That prevents overseas investors from selling Bitcoin in South Korea to profit from — and thereby help narrow — the price gap. South Korea’s isolation from the global market leads investors at home to seek better prices elsewhere. “We are seeing Koreans taking loads of cash to buy Bitcoin in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia where Bitcoin is cheaper,” said Hong Ki-hoon, professor of economics at Hongik University in Seoul. With so many conflicting signals from the government, “I don’t think any of us think that these strong measures will actually be implemented,” said Hyon Hae-in, a 35-year-old Bitcoin investor. “Longtime investors see times like these as opportunities to trade,” she said.",0.0889,0.06461990941157608
395,The Numbers Behind Walmart’s Pay Raise: DealBook Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/business/dealbook/south-korea-bitcoin.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-11T12:19:15+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Why Walmart is raising its hourly wage. • South Korea spooks the market for digital money. • Bond market investors feel some fear, but will stock market bulls? • And what will happen next with the Trump administration’s plans to reopen offshore drilling? Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. What the retail giant is doing: • Raising the starting wage for all hourly workers to $11 an hour, starting next month and costing an extra $300 million • Expanding maternity leave to 10 weeks and paid parental leave to six weeks • Adding a new benefit for adoption expenses of $5,000 per child • Giving out bonuses of up to $1,000 for eligible workers, determined by tenure, up to a total of $400 million Who benefits: Walmart said in its most recent annual report that it had nearly 1.5 million associates in the U.S. That’s much bigger than any other company that has announced tax-related worker benefits to date. (AT&T, for instance, has roughly 200,000 employees who will likely benefit from that company’s $1,000-per-worker bonus.) From C.E.O. Doug McMillon: Who benefits: Walmart said in its most recent annual report that it had nearly 1.5 million associates in the U.S. That’s much bigger than any other company that has announced tax-related worker benefits to date. (AT&T, for instance, has roughly 200,000 employees who will likely benefit from that company’s $1,000-per-worker bonus.) What else is behind the move? The retailer’s efforts to keep workers amid a tightening labor market, which has led companies to fight to keep workers. (The current unemployment rate is at just 4.7 percent.) More from Matthew Boyle of Bloomberg: Critics’ corner — Michael J. de la Merced Dropbox has filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public, Bloomberg reports. The closely-held file-sharing company with a valuation of $10 billion is among a group of high-profile tech start-ups that investors have been waiting for to go public. The offering would follow the disappointing debut of another of those companies, Snap, in March. Shares of Snap are down 15 percent from their initial public offering price. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan will be the lead underwriters on the I.P.O. Dropbox had annualized sales of more than $1 billion, its chief executive, Drew Houston, told Bloomberg in January last year. Bloomberg reports: “A timing quirk in the tax overhaul that President Donald Trump signed last month may be good news for companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1.” The provision at issue, “in effect, gives a company until the end of its fiscal year to measure what’s cash and what isn’t for tax purposes,” That means companies, which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1, have more time “to reduce foreign cash they’ll accumulate this year.” Apple, for one, “may be able to lop more than $4 billion off a future tax bill,” according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School, who wrote the “potential loophole” last month. Shares in the money-transfer services provider were up as much as 8 percent this morning after the company said that it was testing the use of Ripple’s XRP. It’s not quite the same as becoming Long Blockchain, but it still reflects the enthusiasm among investors that arises when a company associates itself with the virtual currency industry. From Moneygram’s C.E.O., Alex Holmes: — Michael J. de la Merced Here’s what the veteran Wall Street consigliere told Bloomberg: — Michael J. de la Merced As of this morning, Bitcoin was down 4.5 percent, Ethereum was down 9 percent and Ripple was down 13 percent, according to CoinMarketCap. Thank the South Korean government, which may  ban virtual currency trading in what has been the third-largest market. Behind the potential move Officials have been concerned about tax evasion and rampant speculation. More from Song Jung-a and Bryan Harris of the FT: A spokesman for President Moon Jae-in played down the comments, saying nothing was finalized. But investors remained spooked. Bitcoin fever shows no other signs of stopping, however. Binance.com, a big virtual currency exchange, said that it had signed up 240,000 users in an hour yesterday. And strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote that virtual currencies may work as real money someday, particularly in developing countries.

396,Should You Buy Bitcoin? Ask a Different Question First,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/your-money/bitcoin-investing.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-05T16:54:50+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"I received these two messages within three minutes of each other recently: Several years back I used to mine Bitcoin, and then I sold most of them off for a down payment for our house. I had 400 BTC at one point, which would be worth $6.8 million today. Needless to say, I am really depressed now. I only kept one Bitcoin. I should have kept more. And this one: My husband has invested in Bitcoin, and my son has invested in Etherium! I am debating about switching my 401(k) to Bitcoin. Everyone, including my mother, is wondering if they should buy Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. And since everyone is asking, there are plenty of semi-informed people providing answers. But if you try to find a solid answer to this question, you will probably just end up more confused. Answering the question means guessing where the price of Bitcoin is headed, and nobody who is being honest actually knows. So may I humbly suggest that asking if we should all buy Bitcoin is the wrong question, and that we should ask a different one instead. The question we should be asking ourselves is this: Does buying Bitcoin fit into my investment plan? That is a much more important question and one that we can all answer much more easily. It places the attention on the process of investing correctly and not on the outcome of events that we have no control over. In order to answer the investing plan question, it might help to clarify a few things. Investing is different from speculating or gambling. Investing is a means to an end, and that end is our collective financial goals. Beating the stock market, buying what’s hot, outperforming a brother-in-law — those are not financial goals. Financial goals are things like having money to send kids to college, buying a house, taking a trip or retiring someday. This is why we invest. If we start by declaring that certain important goals are the reasons we are investing, then we can move on to figuring out the investment process that can help us meet those goals while taking the least amount of risk. The moment we start down that road, we run into the closest thing we have in finance to the law of gravity: diversification. Investors do not put all their eggs in one basket. That’s something speculators do. Our financial goals are important, and the consequences of failure are high. So we spread our risk out by diversifying across lots of different types of investments, like stocks and bonds and real estate, both in the countries where we live and far away. We choose each one carefully based on how it interacts with the others in our portfolio. This is what the process of investing looks like. And yeah, it can be a little boring. But it is far better than repeatedly getting our teeth kicked in from buying high and selling low, which is often what happens when we chase the latest shiny thing that’s grown in value exponentially or that Peter Thiel is betting on. So this isn’t really about Bitcoin at all. Just like it wasn’t about real estate in 2007, or internet stocks in 1999. This is about investing versus something else we typically call gambling or speculating. It’s not about where Bitcoin is going, or what we might have missed out on over the last year. All of that is out of our control. What is in our control is the process of identifying goals, building a portfolio that matches those goals and then maintaining it for a very long time (even when it’s scary, or hard) so we can achieve those goals. So no, I cannot tell you if you should be buying Bitcoin. But I can urge you to ask a very different question.",0.019840540540540543,0.01799226824226824
397,Rise of Bitcoin Competitor Ripple Creates Wealth to Rival Zuckerberg,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/bitcoin-ripple.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-05T00:34:45+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world’s richest people into disarray. Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks. At one point on Thursday, Chris Larsen, a Ripple co-founder who is also the largest holder of Ripple tokens, was worth more than $59 billion, according to figures from Forbes. That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people. Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week — and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin. The explosion in Ripple’s value over the past month is the starkest illustration yet of how the mania around Bitcoin  has spilled over into a broader universe of virtual currencies. These coins — with names like Cardano, Stellar, and Iota — are generally new twists on the Bitcoin technology, which uses a decentralized network of volunteer computers to keep a record, known as a blockchain, of all transactions. While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires — albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies. Mr. Larsen’s soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple — and his Forbes ranking — dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO. “This is beyond insane,” said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. “There’s absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation.” Ripple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens — including Einsteinium and Byteball — that rose more than Bitcoin’s remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider. Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion — when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value — despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading. Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history. Ripple was invented in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer who had created Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange that later dissolved in disgrace. Mr. McCaleb designed Ripple as a faster and more efficient version of Bitcoin, without the mining process that Bitcoin uses to distribute new coins and secure the network. Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software. Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday’s prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.) Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens — known as Lumens — worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency. In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion. Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens — and his riches. Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases. Mr. Larsen was Ripple’s chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company’s executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate. Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company’s technology, including American Express and Banco Santander. But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple’s software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens. Most of the buying and selling of Ripple tokens is happening in South Korea, according to data providers that track virtual currency exchanges, where ordinary investors have thrown money at a wide array of virtual currencies. Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple’s software, but not its tokens. “I’m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP’s valuation,” said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital. Ripple has so far announced that one company, a Mexican money-transfer business, is planning to use the Ripple token. Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple’s chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using — or looking at using — XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements. Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company’s growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle. “It’s clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,” he said. Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse’s company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge. But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company’s board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple’s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices. “An impossibly long list of things already needs to go right for XRP to become a reserve currency for banks,” Ryan Selkis, a virtual currency analyst, wrote in a post on Thursday. But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn’t mean Ripple’s price won’t keep ascending. Why? “Because this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,” he wrote.",0.19187058823529413,0.07417146782955607

Who could have predicted that an article in The New York Times in October describing sexual misconduct by the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein would unleash a torrent of claims about media stars, members of Congress and the judiciary and even an N.F.L. owner? With a little trepidation, here are my thoughts on a few topics that should continue to be of interest in 2018: For those of us who remember the dot.com boom, there is a sense of déjà vu with the frenzy over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has shot up to well over $10,000 in 2017 from about $1,000, according to Coindesk. Cryptocurrencies may be all the rage, but the Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on initial coin offerings as a potential avenue for fraud. These I.C.O.s allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, with some offerings raising millions of dollars in just a few days. A company raising money from the public by selling something whose value depends on the success of its venture sounds like a security. That is why the S.E.C. has ramped up its scrutiny of I.C.O.s to determine whether issuers are skirting the detailed — and expensive — disclosure requirements for dealing with investors. If anyone is going to rain on the I.C.O. parade, it will be the S.E.C. On Dec. 1, the agency filed an emergency action in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn to stop an offering of PlexCoin, which the complaint said raised more than $15 million by promoting a return of more than 1,000 percent in a month. The S.E.C. has also filed actions for fraud involving other I.C.O.s. We should expect it to continue to crack down on companies using digital currencies to raise money without following the requirements for selling securities. On Dec. 11, the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, issued a statement warning investors and investment professionals about the potential problems posed by I.C.O.s if they operate as unregistered securities. He pointed out that “there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.” How the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the presidential election will be resolved is anyone’s guess. In many white-collar criminal investigations, where prosecutors start is not always where they end. The investigation has transfixed Washington like nothing since the sprawling investigation of President Bill Clinton. Mr. Mueller’s team has already obtained two guilty pleas, including one from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and indictments of President Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort Jr., and a top aide. Additionally, The New York Times reported that an investigation by the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn into the financial dealings of the family company of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, involves a subpoena for financial records sent to Deutsche Bank. There is no direct link between that investigation and Mr. Mueller’s, but when prosecutors follow the money, they can find themselves in unforeseen places. Mr. Kushner has already been interviewed by the special counsel’s investigators, and what the parameters of the inquiry are remain unknown. Defense lawyers are usually hesitant to let a client speak with prosecutors without the protection of immunity, but Washington investigations are different because even the hint of asserting the Fifth Amendment could have significant political repercussions, so everyone is proclaiming their cooperation with Mr. Mueller’s office. At the same time, President Trump’s political allies have been increasingly questioning the propriety and objectivity of the Mueller investigation. We should expect the veneer of cooperation to fray over the next few months, especially if the investigation moves closer to the president’s inner circle. A persistent criticism of the Justice Department in the wake of the financial crisis was the lack of prosecutions. Few individuals were charged, and the large banks and Wall Street firms paid fines and penalties that amounted to a fraction of their current profits. One response was a new policy, announced in 2015, that required federal prosecutors investigating corporate misconduct to prioritize the prosecution of individual employees and to put pressure on corporations to turn over evidence if they wanted credit for cooperating. There are signs that this policy might be changed to give corporations a wider berth to avoid charges. In September, Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said that the policy was “under review and I anticipate that there may be some change to the policy on corporate prosecutions.” No changes have been announced yet, but one indication of where federal prosecutors may be headed is a new approach to corporate cooperation in overseas bribery investigations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act imposes liability on companies and individuals who pay bribes to foreign officials to “obtain or retain business.” It has been used against a wide range of companies with overseas operations, resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. For instance, Wal-Mart recently disclosed it had reserved $283 million for a possible settlement of fines for bribes it had paid that were first revealed by The New York Times in 2012. A revised policy for treating companies involved in bribery investigations issued in November presumes they will avoid liability for violations if they have “voluntarily self-disclosed misconduct in an F.C.P.A. matter, fully cooperated, and timely and appropriately remediated” the misconduct. In a speech announcing the changed approach, Mr. Rosenstein said: “It makes sense to treat corporations differently than individuals because corporate liability is vicarious; it is only derivative of individual liability.” An interesting question is whether this more lenient approach will spread to other areas, such as securities, health care and environmental violations. If companies should be treated differently, then perhaps that portends a kinder, gentler Justice Department when a corporation reports its violations.

399,Russia and Venezuela’s Plan to Sidestep Sanctions: Virtual Currencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/russia-venezuela-virtual-currencies.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBitcoin,2018-01-03T20:47:23+0000,"['bitcoin', '', '']",nyt,"SAN FRANCISCO — Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions. Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States. The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure. What has seemed like a fringe concept is starting to gain some level of acceptance in global finance. Several of the largest central banks in the world, including the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China, have said they are looking at using the technology introduced by Bitcoin to track and issue their own digital currencies. In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicolás Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government’s oil and natural resources. In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble. “When it comes to state-sensitive types of activities, this instrument suits us very well,” one of Mr. Putin’s aides, Sergei Glazyev, said last month in a conversation about the crypto ruble, according to several Russian news outlets. “We can settle payments with our business partners all over the world regardless of sanctions.” Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela’s Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That’s because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies. That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority. That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules. But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking. In a speech last year, a member of the German central bank’s executive board, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said the bank’s “conceptual study shows that blockchain technology can be adapted to meet the current needs and requirements of the financial system.” “The prototype works,” he added. These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome. None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control. Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country’s gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves. “To overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,” he said. Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation. The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government’s natural resources. The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has experienced in recent years because of the government’s unbridled expansion of the money supply. The boldness of the Petro plan is in proportion to Venezuela’s desperate economic condition, which has officials looking for anything that could help. “The country is in a social crisis,” said José Ángel Álvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. “How do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.” Mr. Álvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018. But the link between the currency and the government’s oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros’s government. There is a measure of irony in the government’s interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro’s government. An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bolívar, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm. The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity. Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities — more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now. In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country. Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system. “The irony is in front of us,” he said. “They have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.” The Russian government has also not looked kindly upon its citizens’ use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. While the government’s policies have remained opaque, officials with the Russian Central Bank have talked about blocking the access of people inside the country to virtual currency websites, and Mr. Putin has pointed out the many potential illegal uses of the technology. “First and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,” he said in October. But Mr. Putin has indicated that he is open to potential uses of the technology that would be under his control. In June, he had a much publicized conversation with Vitalik Buterin, the creator of one of the largest virtual currency networks, Ethereum. Mr. Buterin was raised in Canada and has dual Russian and Canadian citizenship. A number of officials with the central bank and the Ministry of Communication have dropped hints about the creation of some sort of crypto ruble. The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions. The Russian minister of communications, Nikolai Nikiforov, said in October that a crypto ruble would be designed quite differently from Bitcoin, with no need for the mining process through which Bitcoins are released into the world. Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well. The authorities in the United States have long been aware that virtual currencies might be used to evade sanctions. David S. Cohen, a Treasury official focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, said in 2014 that the American authorities were not seeing any widespread efforts to get around sanctions with virtual currencies. But, he said at the time, “these are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.”",0.1117376811594203,0.07920404876926615
