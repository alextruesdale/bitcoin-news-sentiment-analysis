0,Factbox: Ten years of bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N50GE,"October 31, 2018 01:19am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin, the world’s first and most famous cryptocurrency, celebrates its tenth birthday on Wednesday.   Its emergence has spawned a multitude of other digital currencies, brought blockchain technology to global attention, and vexed regulators worried about its crime misuse and weakness to hacking.  The following are some major milestones in bitcoin’s first decade:  Oct. 31, 2008    The still-unidentified Satoshi Nakamoto releases a nine-page academic paper that sets out how bitcoin would work. “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” also gives the first description of the blockchain decentralized ledger, the technology that underpins the digital currency.  Jan. 3, 2009    Nakamoto mines the first “block” of bitcoins on the blockchain. Days later, Nakamoto sends bitcoins in its first ever transaction.  Jan. 12, 2009   The first bitcoin transaction takes place between Nakamoto and developer Hal Finney. The transaction is recorded in block 170.  Oct. 12, 2009  Martti Malmi, a software developer from Finland, sends 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 to NewLibertyStandard, one of the regulars in a bitcoin forum. The transaction is realized using PayPal. The bitcoins are used to seed a new bitcoin exchange site called New Liberty Standard.  October 2009   The New Liberty Standard establishes the value of bitcoin at 1,309.03 bitcoins to 1 dollar.   February 2010  The world’s first bitcoin market is established by dwdollar.  May 22, 2010    Software developer Laszlo Hanecz buys two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, widely seen as the first time the digital currency is used for its intended purpose - the purchase of goods.  July 7, 2010  Bitcoin’s new software is released by the community of developers and over the next five days, there is a ten-fold increase in its exchange value - from US$0.008 per bitcoin to US$0.08 per bitcoin.  July 17, 2010  Mt. Gox is launched, which eventually becomes the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, prior to going bankrupt in 2014.  Nov. 28, 2013  As media attention intensifies, Bitcoin tops $1,000 for the first time. It falls below that level only days later, and does not reach the landmark again for over three years.       Feb. 28, 2014  Tokyo-based Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy protection after hackers steal some 850,00 bitcoins - worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash. The theft, the biggest of digital coins ever, underscores security flaws at exchanges and the risks faced by investors in the unregulated sector.  Aug. 1, 2017  Bitcoin’s underlying software code splits to create Bitcoin Cash, a clone of bitcoin. The move is spearheaded by bitcoin miners in China unhappy with scheduled improvements to the currency’s technology meant to increase its capacity to process transactions.        Dec. 10, 2017  Chicago exchange operators Cboe Global Markets Inc and CME Group Inc launch bitcoin futures trading, allowing professional mainstream investors to bet on the price of the digital currency.         Dec. 18, 2017  Bitcoin hits its record high of $19,666 on cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, the high water mark of a frenzied year that sees bitcoin climb by more than 1,300 percent as retail investors scramble to buy.         June 29, 2018  Bitcoin slides to its lowest level since its December peak, hurt by tighter regulatory oversight across the world and waning interest from retail investors.            Oct. 19, 2018  The global money-laundering watchdog says it will set out by next year rules for how governments should regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in a bid to stamp out the criminal use of bitcoin and other digital coins.

7,Bitcoin sinks abruptly after seven weeks of recovery,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1SN0CN,"May 17, 2019 05:35am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The price of bitcoin abruptly sank more than 20% on Friday, a move that didn’t appear to have a particular trigger and came after a strong recovery in the crypto-currency since early April that took it to 10-month highs.  Bitcoin fell to as low as $6,178 at Bitstamp exchange, down 21.6% from the previous close and last stood down 8.2% at $7,236.  “The sudden fall does not appear to have been driven by any particular news item,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading at digital asset brokerage OSL.  “Rather it looks to be driven by large sell orders by a handful of people or even just one person, who are likely realizing profits after the recent price rise or looking to acquire more at lower prices,” Rabaglia said.  After many lackluster months, the price of bitcoin started to rally from early April, hitting a 10-month high earlier this week.  While there is no clear consensus on what drove the rally, some analyst have noted rising tensions between Washington and Beijing may have helped to boost demand for bitcoin and other digital currencies that are not backed by a government.

By 1300 GMT, bitcoin was trading at $6,263 on the BitStamp exchange, leaving investors who had bought it on Halloween 2017 facing yearly losses of nearly 3 percent.  A year ago, bitcoin closed at $6,443.22 as it tore towards a record high of near $20,000, hit in December.  That run, fuelled by frenzied buying by retail investors from South Korea to the United States, pushed bitcoin to calendar-year gains of over 1,300 percent.  Ten years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s still-unidentified founder, released a white paper detailing the need for an online currency that could be used for payments without the involvement of a third party, such as a bank.

Bitcoin fell to as low as $5,533.09 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. It was down 9 percent at $5,690.47.  “For the last few days you could see the consolidation happening and the price was moving on the downside,” said Naeem Aslam, analyst at ThinkMarkets, a multi-asset online brokerage.  “The break of $6,200 yesterday gave a fair indication that there are no buyers on the sidelines at this point,” he added.   Bitcoin's weakness spread to other cryptocurrencies, with ethereum, the second-largest, dropping to a two-month low. Ethereum was last down 10 percent at $182.41 ETH=BTSP.  Wednesday’s sell-off in cryptocurrencies pushed the sector’s market capitalization to under $200 billion for the first time since around mid-September, according to data from industry data tracker coinmarketcap.com.  “What you are seeing... is a breakout on the downside. Sometimes when things happen, it takes a while for the true reason to become clear - an exchange trade or regulatory action,” said Charlie Hayter, founder of industry website Cryptocompare in London.  Other market participants suggested that Thursday’s impending “hard fork,” or split of bitcoin cash - another cryptocurrency that emerged out of bitcoin - into two separate currencies, has caused some volatility as well.    Twice a year, bitcoin cash undergoes scheduled protocol upgrades, which include splitting its network.   “For our trading activities, the hard fork recently has generated tremendous interest and trading volume, above 4 billion daily, among traders,” said Ricky Li, co-founder of crypto trading and advisory firm Altonomy.  Overall, analysts said the outlook for bitcoin remains unclear, with longer-term forecasts dependent on the virtual currency becoming a reliable store of value or a viable payment mechanism.  However, there are growing signs of greater institutional participation in bitcoin, such as increased demand for a bitcoin exchange traded fund and rising bitcoin futures volume, analysts said. But they noted that actual participation remains low among both institutional and retail investors.

16,Early bitcoin investors count winnings after volatile decade,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N50FA,"October 31, 2018 01:19am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Seven years ago, Marshall Hayner gave his grandfather one bitcoin, worth about $30. On the paper wallet he fashioned to commemorate the gift, the U.S. entrepreneur and software developer wrote: “Do not open until $100,000.”  It made Hayner’s grandparents laugh, and indeed bitcoin has not come anywhere near that level. But it is worth more than 200 times what it was in 2011 when Hayner made the gift.  Investors who took a chance on the fledgling currency and stuck with it have been on a rollercoaster ride - but are optimistic that they are still onto a winner.   “I have seen these run-ups and drops in bitcoin and I did not even flinch,” said 34-year old Hayner, who started mining bitcoins in 2009 when the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies was worth nothing. He also founded payments company Metal Pay.   “I believe in this technology. I really believe that bitcoin is the next digital gold,” he said in an interview this week.  Bitcoin on Wednesday celebrates ten years since Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mysterious founder, released a whitepaper outlining the need for an internet currency that could be used as payment without going through a third party like a bank.  One bitcoin is now worth around $6,200. That is a steep 70 percent fall from its all-time high of near $20,000 in December last year, hurt by a more intense regulatory scrutiny around the world, as well as the rise of cryptocurrency crime including hacking, but a substantial boost for any early investors who bet on it.   “If the price goes down, I am happy because I was able to sell some,” said Israeli entrepreneur Daniel Peled, who has bought since late 2013 and believes another record peak is a few years away. “And if it goes up, I am happy too because I am still holding some.”  Peled’s optimism is partly based on his waiting for bitcoin’s next “halving,” which has constrained its supply and has caused its spike as demand increased.

18,Birthday blues for bitcoin as investors face year-on-year loss,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N51WV,"October 31, 2018 09:17pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin was heading towards a year-on-year loss on Wednesday, its 10th birthday, the first loss since last year’s bull market, when the original and biggest digital coin muscled its way to worldwide attention with months of frenzied buying.  By 1300 GMT, bitcoin BTC=BTSP was trading at $6,263 on the BitStamp exchange, leaving investors who had bought it on Halloween 2017 facing yearly losses of nearly 3 percent.    A year ago, bitcoin closed at $6,443.22 as it tore towards a record high of near $20,000, hit in December.   That run, fuelled by frenzied buying by retail investors from South Korea to the United States, pushed bitcoin to calendar-year gains of over 1,300 percent.  Ten years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s still-unidentified founder, released a white paper detailing the need for an online currency that could be used for payments without the involvement of a third party, such as a bank.  Traders and market participants said the Halloween milestone was inevitable, given losses of around 70 percent from bitcoin’s peak and the continuing but incomplete shift towards investment by mainstream financial firms.  “The value mechanisms of crypto and bitcoin today are based more on underlying tech than hype and FOMO (fear of missing out),” said Josh Bramley, head trader at crypto wealth management firm Blockstars.   Growing use of blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - is now powering valuations of the digital currency, he said, cautioning that some expectations for widespread use have not yet materialised.       Others said improvements to infrastructure such as custody services may allow mainstream investors who are wary of buying bitcoin to take positions.  “We see behind closed doors financial and non-financial institutions beavering away to create the infrastructure,” said Ben Sebley, head of brokerage at NKB Group, a blockchain advisory and investment firm.  Bitcoin has endured year-on-year losses before, according to data from CryptoCompare, most recently in 2015-15.  Retail investors still account for a strong proportion of trading, market players said.   Investors who bet early on bitcoin and have stuck with it have faced a roller-coaster ride in its first decade. Many told Reuters they are optimistic that they are still onto a winner.

Keplerk said it has secured a contract with a local cash register software provider to give tobacco shops the possibility to sell the cryptocurrency to their customers.  The tobacco shop owners will sell customers a voucher which can be used to obtain bitcoins via an electronic wallet owned by  Keplerk. They will be the first brick and mortar shops to sell bitcoins anywhere in the world, Keplerk said.  “Tobacco shop owners are the best channel as they are trusted by customers and they are used to sell vouchers such as credit for mobile phones,” Adil Zakhar, Keplerk’s director for strategy and development, said.  Keplerk has been working on the project to sell bitcoins to retail investors for a year and a half.  French regulators, including the country’s central bank, have warned savers about the potential risks associated with investing into cryptocurrencies.  The central bank said it does not supervise the Keplerk initiative.  “Those are purely speculative assets and not currencies.

Keplerk said it will finance the project by charging a 7 percent commission fee on every transaction.

Bitcoin fell to as low as $6,178 at Bitstamp exchange, down 21.6% from the previous close and last stood down 8.2% at $7,236.  “The sudden fall does not appear to have been driven by any particular news item,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading at digital asset brokerage OSL.  “Rather it looks to be driven by large sell orders by a handful of people or even just one person, who are likely realizing profits after the recent price rise or looking to acquire more at lower prices,” Rabaglia said.  After many lackluster months, the price of bitcoin started to rally from early April, hitting a 10-month high earlier this week.  While there is no clear consensus on what drove the rally, some analyst have noted rising tensions between Washington and Beijing may have helped to boost demand for bitcoin and other digital currencies that are not backed by a government.

Bitcoin teller machines operator Coinsource, based in Fort Worth, Texas, has 40 bitcoin kiosks in the state, located in New York City and Westchester and Nassau Counties. The company allows customers to insert cash and buy bitcoin and store it on their mobile wallet, or sell bitcoin for cash, by scanning their mobile wallet at the kiosk.  “Today’s approval is a further step in implementing strong regulatory safeguards and effective risk-based controls while encouraging the responsible growth of financial innovation,” Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said in a statement on Thursday.  The state Department of Financial Services has approved 12 charters or licenses so far for companies in the virtual currency marketplace.  The New York regulatory agency said Thursday’s approval follows a comprehensive and rigorous review of Coinsource’s application and is subject to significant regulatory conditions.  “New York represents not just a center of global innovation but also one of our largest target markets,” said Sheffield Clark, Coinsource’s chief executive officer.  Founded in 2015, Coinsource deploys ATMs to key population centers across the United States, with more than 200 machines in 19 states, including the District of Columbia.   Coinsource said the majority of customers choose to use bitcoin ATMs as an alternative to online exchanges, which require highly technical knowledge, has long transaction delays, high fees, and limited customer service support. Aside from that the ATM operator said online exchanges are vulnerable to manipulative trading activity and fund hacks.  “Bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency, and in 2018, is increasingly being adopted by the mainstream,” Sheffield said.  DFS has earlier granted virtual licenses to BitFlyer, BitPay, Coinbase, Circle, Genesis Global Trading, XRP II, Square, and Xapo, with charters issued to Gemini Trust Company, Paxos (formerly itBit), and Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC.

25,From bitcoins to tomatoes: all change in Georgia after currency slump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1R703A,"March 25, 2019 09:02pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TBILISI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After years spent farming money in his uncle’s basement in Tbilisi, Georgian tech entrepreneur Shota Siradze turned over the dingy space to a more traditional crop: tomatoes.  Until November, the dark cellar underneath his family’s Soviet apartment block had served as an unlikely head office to Siradze’s thriving cryptocurrency business.   The cellar was one of many moribund spaces - garages, farms and warehouses - that had taken on a new life as Georgia fell in love with bitcoin and triggered a virtual gold rush.   Bitcoin began circulating in 2009 as an electronic currency operating outside the traditional banking system.   It is created as payoff for solving a run of complex sums that are used to verify transactions on blockchain - the system underpinning the currency - and is stored online.   Bitcoin’s value has ranged from a fraction of a dollar to nearly $20,000 in its short life, spawning countless copycat currencies and many millionaires.   But as the virtual coins slumped to a current low of about $4,000, Siradze’s operation became unprofitable, forcing the 29-year-old and his business partner to reconsider their options.   “As prices went down, we started thinking about alternatives and came up with this,” said Siradze, pointing at two rows of tomatoes ripening on the vine under artificial light inside a room heated by a cryptocurrency mining computer.   A few tomatoes will not a fortune make, but it keeps the space occupied and machines busy earning a bit of spare change.  Georgia, a former Soviet republic of 4 million people, became a global cryptocurrency powerhouse in the past five years as cheap energy, tax breaks and business-friendly regulations spurred investment, according to the World Bank.  Global tech firm Bitfury, a world leader in blockchain, set up shop in Georgia in 2014. In its wake, as the value of cryptocurrencies soared, a crypto craze ignited locals.   Thousands began mining: the process of producing bitcoins by solving maths problems with high-powered computers.  Bitcoin cash machines appeared in Tbilisi as cryptocurrency operations took root, injecting life in often abandoned buildings.  Last year, the World Bank estimated about 5 percent of Georgian families were involved in the business, which sucked up almost 15 percent of the country’s energy demand, making it the world’s third largest producer of cryptocurrencies.  The slump in bitcoin’s value, however, meant revenue from mining no longer even covered the energy costs, forcing many to halt operations, said Vano Narimanidze, a co-founder of Association Blockchain Georgia networking group.  About 80 percent of all mining ventures in Georgia turned off the lights, said Narimanidze, and many rooms that had buzzed with computer fans fell still once more.  “People sold their houses, their cars, to buy (currency) miners and some of them were lucky enough to get back the money they put in,” said Siradze. “But most of them lost out.”  Only big businesses and those operating in tax-free zones or areas where electricity is cheap are still running, he added.  Siradze and his partner Irakli Pruidze had to pull the plug.   The two former IT workers owned a few processors of their own and ran a consultancy helping others to set up mining farms in exchange for a share of their profits.  One farm occupied the top floor of a disused warehouse inside a historic brandy factory in Tbilisi.  It folded in November.   Most machines were sold, the rest lie idle, collecting dust alongside a Stalin bust and a few Soviet-era posters.  A few kilometers away, another 1,000 miners - a group of processing units - lie unused inside a disbanded electronics factory that had briefly buzzed as a data center.  “This was an old useless factory of spare parts that stopped working after the fall of the Soviet Union. We gave it a new function but unfortunately not for a long time,” said cryptocurrency businessman Lasha Khanishvili.  RE-INVENTION  While some entrepreneurs have simply switched off their machines hoping value might bounce back, others have found new uses for their machines and spaces.  “You can just wait - or do something else while waiting,” said Siradze.    Narimanidze, of the Association Blockchain Georgia, sold three miners that had each earned him about $40 a day in 2018, and kept three more in his family’s rural home.  “They keep the house warm in winter,” he said.  Excess heat generated by computer servers has long been a problem for cryptocurrency miners worldwide, with media reports citing a host of innovative uses for all that hot air, be it drying strawberries or powering radiators.  Siradze and 30-year-old Pruidze opted for tomatoes.  Using LED lights and hydroponic technology, which replaces soil with water, they set up a mini farm in their basement office, growing 10 plants that have produced about 6 kilos of since autumn, only worth about $30 at retail price.   “We want to go bigger,” said Siradze, who hopes to expand his basement allotment into the rooftops and join a growing global trend for urban farming.  Other green-thumbed miners have launched similar efforts in Canada and the Czech Republic, according to media reports, and Siradze voiced some of the same entrepreneurial excitement that once powered his beloved bitcoin to highs.  “You can heat up 100 square meters with 10 miners ... if you sustain them with solar power or wind power you’ll get free coins, free heat and free tomatoes,” he said.  “What else do you need?”   Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

RE-INVENTION  While some entrepreneurs have simply switched off their machines hoping value might bounce back, others have found new uses for their machines and spaces.  “You can just wait - or do something else while waiting,” said Siradze.    Narimanidze, of the Association Blockchain Georgia, sold three miners that had each earned him about $40 a day in 2018, and kept three more in his family’s rural home.  “They keep the house warm in winter,” he said.  Excess heat generated by computer servers has long been a problem for cryptocurrency miners worldwide, with media reports citing a host of innovative uses for all that hot air, be it drying strawberries or powering radiators.  Siradze and 30-year-old Pruidze opted for tomatoes.  Using LED lights and hydroponic technology, which replaces soil with water, they set up a mini farm in their basement office, growing 10 plants that have produced about 6 kilos of since autumn, only worth about $30 at retail price.   “We want to go bigger,” said Siradze, who hopes to expand his basement allotment into the rooftops and join a growing global trend for urban farming.  Other green-thumbed miners have launched similar efforts in Canada and the Czech Republic, according to media reports, and Siradze voiced some of the same entrepreneurial excitement that once powered his beloved bitcoin to highs.  “You can heat up 100 square meters with 10 miners ... if you sustain them with solar power or wind power you’ll get free coins, free heat and free tomatoes,” he said.  “What else do you need?”   Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

29,"Bitcoin, Ethereum tumble as crypto bear market lingers",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1V50SJ,"August 14, 2018 01:43pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped to an eight-week low on Tuesday, while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market value, sank to a more than one-year trough as they continued their bearish trend, undermined by a strong U.S. dollar and global tensions related to Turkey.  The Turkish crisis has dampened risk appetite in recent sessions, spurring a sell-off in emerging market currencies and stocks and prompting inflows to safe-haven assets such as the dollar and U.S. Treasuries.  The original virtual currency fell as low as $5,880 on Bitstamp, the lowest since late June. It was last down 3.5 percent at $6,036.74. So far in 2018, bitcoin has fallen nearly 57 percent, after soaring more than 1,300 percent last year.  Ethereum plunged nearly 9 percent to $258.45 on Bitstamp, falling to a more than one-year low of $250.54. According to crypto data tracker coinmarketcap.com, the third-largest cryptocurrency, Ripple, fell 13.4 percent to 25 U.S. cents.  “What began earlier this week as a rout in the Turkish lira has quickly spread throughout all markets and now it seems to be affecting the cryptos as well,” said Israel-based Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro.  The total market capitalization for cryptocurrencies tumbled to $191.4 billion, the lowest since early November last year, coinmarketcap.com data showed.  Bitcoin has held up pretty well amid the sell-off in the cryptocurrency market, analysts said. As a percentage of market capitalization, bitcoin’s share rose to 54.5 percent, suggesting that investors were willing to hold the more widely held and well-capitalized digital currencies.  During the heady days of the cryptocurrency boom in late 2017 and January this year, bitcoin’s share fell to 32 percent.  The cryptocurrency market has been stung by several decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision on exchange-traded funds.  Late last month, the SEC stood by its decision to block the ETF application of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of crypto exchange Gemini Trust Co LLC.  Early this month, the SEC delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin ETF submitted by money management firm VanEck and crypto startup SolidX.  “I believe we’re just witnessing the continuation of the cryptocurrency bear market. This is not the first or last cyclical asset to behave this way,” said Clement Thibault, senior analyst at Investing.com.  “Looking ahead, I don’t think we’re at the end of the cycle just yet and I can see bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continuing to fall before a meaningful return back up.” (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Dan Grebler)",-0.0007136363636363658,0.047256657483930216
30,UPDATE 1-Bitcoin drops to 1-year low as slump persists; ethereum down sharply,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1XP1CF,"November 14, 2018 02:17pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell to a more than one-year low on Wednesday, breaching  a key support level of $6,000 and causing a wave of selling in the digital currency and other crypto assets in what has been a prolonged market slump that began early this year.  Bitcoin fell to as low as $5,533.09 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. It was down 9 percent at $5,690.47.  “For the last few days you could see the consolidation happening and the price was moving on the downside,” said Naeem Aslam, analyst at ThinkMarkets, a multi-asset online brokerage.  “The break of $6,200 yesterday gave a fair indication that there are no buyers on the sidelines at this point,” he added.   Bitcoin's weakness spread to other cryptocurrencies, with ethereum, the second-largest, dropping to a two-month low. Ethereum was last down 10 percent at $182.41 ETH=BTSP.  Wednesday’s sell-off in cryptocurrencies pushed the sector’s market capitalization to under $200 billion for the first time since around mid-September, according to data from industry data tracker coinmarketcap.com.  “What you are seeing... is a breakout on the downside. Sometimes when things happen, it takes a while for the true reason to become clear - an exchange trade or regulatory action,” said Charlie Hayter, founder of industry website Cryptocompare in London.  Other market participants suggested that Thursday’s impending “hard fork,” or split of bitcoin cash - another cryptocurrency that emerged out of bitcoin - into two separate currencies, has caused some volatility as well.    Twice a year, bitcoin cash undergoes scheduled protocol upgrades, which include splitting its network.   “For our trading activities, the hard fork recently has generated tremendous interest and trading volume, above 4 billion daily, among traders,” said Ricky Li, co-founder of crypto trading and advisory firm Altonomy.  Overall, analysts said the outlook for bitcoin remains unclear, with longer-term forecasts dependent on the virtual currency becoming a reliable store of value or a viable payment mechanism.  However, there are growing signs of greater institutional participation in bitcoin, such as increased demand for a bitcoin exchange traded fund and rising bitcoin futures volume, analysts said. But they noted that actual participation remains low among both institutional and retail investors.

31,UPDATE 1-New York regulator grants virtual license to bitcoin ATM operator,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1XC157,"November 01, 2018 11:26am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Yorkers will be able to use their mobile phones to obtain bitcoin or sell it for cash at kiosks similar to ATMs in and around New York City after the state Department of Financial Services said on Thursday it has approved the virtual currency license of Coinsource Inc.  Bitcoin teller machines operator Coinsource, based in Fort Worth, Texas, has 40 bitcoin kiosks in the state, located in New York City and Westchester and Nassau Counties. The company allows customers to insert cash and buy bitcoin and store it on their mobile wallet, or sell bitcoin for cash, by scanning their mobile wallet at the kiosk.  “Today’s approval is a further step in implementing strong regulatory safeguards and effective risk-based controls while encouraging the responsible growth of financial innovation,” Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said in a statement on Thursday.  The state Department of Financial Services has approved 12 charters or licenses so far for companies in the virtual currency marketplace.  The New York regulatory agency said Thursday’s approval follows a comprehensive and rigorous review of Coinsource’s application and is subject to significant regulatory conditions.  “New York represents not just a center of global innovation but also one of our largest target markets,” said Sheffield Clark, Coinsource’s chief executive officer.  Founded in 2015, Coinsource deploys ATMs to key population centers across the United States, with more than 200 machines in 19 states, including the District of Columbia.   Coinsource said the majority of customers choose to use bitcoin ATMs as an alternative to online exchanges, which require highly technical knowledge, has long transaction delays, high fees, and limited customer service support. Aside from that the ATM operator said online exchanges are vulnerable to manipulative trading activity and fund hacks.  “Bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency, and in 2018, is increasingly being adopted by the mainstream,” Sheffield said.  DFS has earlier granted virtual licenses to BitFlyer, BitPay, Coinbase, Circle, Genesis Global Trading, XRP II, Square, and Xapo, with charters issued to Gemini Trust Company, Paxos (formerly itBit), and Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC.

38,China wants to ban bitcoin mining,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1RL0C4,"April 09, 2019 07:45pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s state planner wants to eliminate bitcoin mining in the country, according to a draft list of industrial activities the agency is seeking to stop in a sign of growing government pressure on the cryptocurrency sector.  China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory grey area.    The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.  The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to more than 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.  It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.  State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday the draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry.   “The NDRC’s move is in line overall with China’s desire to control different layers of the rapidly growing crypto industry, and does not yet signal a major shift in policy,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment firm Kenetic.   “I believe China simply wants to ‘reboot’ the crypto industry into one that they have oversight on, the same approach they took with the Internet.”  Other bitcoin traders said they were not surprised by the government’s move.      “Bitcoin mining wastes a lot of electricity,” said one Chinese bitcoin trader who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.   Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted they were puzzled by the surge.   Bitcoin, which accounts for around half of the cryptocurrency market, was down by around 1.4 percent on Tuesday, while other major coins such as Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP also fell by similar amounts. Traders in London said it was unclear how much the Chinese move was weighing on the market.    The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.  China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.  Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners that team up for economies of scale - are located in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said in December.  “Half of the network is probably located in China,” said Alex de Vries, a consultant with PwC in Amsterdam who specializes on blockchain and researches cryptocurrency mining. He added that the number of mining facilities in the world is still limited to several hundred.  Countries with relatively cheap electricity have emerged as major hosts of cryptocurrency mining. Mati Greenspan, an analyst with eToro in Israel, said any ban by China would cut a key supply of cheap electricity for the industry and raise the average cost to mine bitcoin.  Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.   However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc, have since let their applications lapse.   People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies’ business models and prospects.  Bitmain declined to comment on the NDRC’s proposal to ban bitcoin mining. Canaan did not respond to requests for comment.   According to Canaan’s IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for cryptocurrency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.   The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020.

39,Bitcoin sinks to two-month low as downtrend persists,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1TE251,"June 12, 2018 05:13pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell to a two-month low on Tuesday, sliding in three of the last four sessions on nagging regulatory and security concerns after the weekend hacking of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail.  The original virtual currency is nearing its lowest level of the year of just under $6,000 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. It fell to a low of below $6,500 and last traded down 4.7 percent at $6,551.48.  So far in 2018, bitcoin is down nearly 53 percent, after soaring more than 1,300 percent last year.  On Sunday, Coinrail, a relatively small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, said its system was hit by “cyber intrusion,” causing a loss of about 30 percent of the coins traded on the exchange. It did not quantify its value, but local news outlet Yonhap news estimated in an unsourced report that about 40 billion won ($37.28 million) worth of virtual coins were stolen.  The latest hacking wiped out more than $40 billion in the market value of the cryptocurrency market on Sunday. Bitcoin itself declined by nearly $1,000.    Bitcoin was able to recover after Sunday’s bloodbath on Monday, but it has since continued its downtrend.  “Bitcoin is in a liquidity vacuum at the moment. Volumes on the crypto exchanges are now below $5 billion per day, their lowest levels since November 2017, before things got out of hand,” Israel-based Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst, at eToro, said.  “As the trading activity is very low, even a small amount of pressure can move the price quite drastically. Kind of like if you hit a baseball in outer space,” he added.  Other digital currencies also declined in sympathy with bitcoin. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was down 5 percent over the past 24 hours to $496.07, while the third-largest, Ripple, lost 4.3 percent to $0.55, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.  South Korea is one of the world’s major cryptocurrency trading centers, and is home to one of the most heavily trafficked virtual coin exchanges, Bithumb.  Investors and regulators were jolted earlier this year after Japan’s cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was hacked in a high-profile theft of over half a billion dollars worth of digital currency.

The original virtual currency is nearing its lowest level of the year of just under $6,000 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. It fell to a low of below $6,500 and last traded down 4.7 percent at $6,551.48.  So far in 2018, bitcoin is down nearly 53 percent, after soaring more than 1,300 percent last year.  On Sunday, Coinrail, a relatively small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, said its system was hit by “cyber intrusion,” causing a loss of about 30 percent of the coins traded on the exchange. It did not quantify its value, but local news outlet Yonhap news estimated in an unsourced report that about 40 billion won ($37.28 million) worth of virtual coins were stolen.  The latest hacking wiped out more than $40 billion in the market value of the cryptocurrency market on Sunday. Bitcoin itself declined by nearly $1,000.    Bitcoin was able to recover after Sunday’s bloodbath on Monday, but it has since continued its downtrend.  “Bitcoin is in a liquidity vacuum at the moment. Volumes on the crypto exchanges are now below $5 billion per day, their lowest levels since November 2017, before things got out of hand,” Israel-based Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst, at eToro, said.  “As the trading activity is very low, even a small amount of pressure can move the price quite drastically. Kind of like if you hit a baseball in outer space,” he added.  Other digital currencies also declined in sympathy with bitcoin. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was down 5 percent over the past 24 hours to $496.07, while the third-largest, Ripple, lost 4.3 percent to $0.55, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.  South Korea is one of the world’s major cryptocurrency trading centers, and is home to one of the most heavily trafficked virtual coin exchanges, Bithumb.  Investors and regulators were jolted earlier this year after Japan’s cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was hacked in a high-profile theft of over half a billion dollars worth of digital currency.

Bitcoin, the original and biggest cryptocurrency, has gained over 10 percent since Wednesday.  The No.2 coin by market capitalisation Ethereum has gained 21 percent in the same period, with No.3 coin Ripple’s XRP gaining 9.5 percent.  Six consecutive days of gains is a rarity for bitcoin that it last saw in July - a bright patch during 2018 when bitcoin’s value crashed by three-quarters.  Prices have not recovered since, with bitcoin trading at between $3,000-$4,000 this year.  The entry of mainstream investors into cryptocurrencies and the clearer regulation of the industry - both widely cited as probable catalysts for price moves - have not happened on any meaningful scale.  Bitcoin was trading around $3,920 in early afternoon, up 0.5 percent on the day.  Traders and analysts cited a drip of news perceived as positive for the uptake of cryptocurrencies by mainstream finance and consumers as giving momentum to the rally, including JP Morgan’s introduction of a digital coin for payments on its private blockchain.  Mati Greenspan, an analyst with eToro in Israel, said a shortage in the creation of Ethereum added momentum to the rally in bitcoin.  Price moves between cryptocurrencies are highly correlated, and a spike in the price of Ethereum on Sunday preceded a 7 percent gain for bitcoin on Monday.  “You have to think of the crypto trader at their desk - they see moves across the board and then buy up their favourite coins,” Greenspan said. “By now it’s already just full-blown optimism.”  So-called alt coins have also gained heavily in the last week, with EOS and Litecoin gaining 35 percent and 21 percent respectively since Wednesday.  Moves in these coins preceded buying of bitcoin, said Josh Bramley, head trader at crypto wealth management firm Blockstars.  The identity of those driving bitcoin’s rally is impossible to ascertain.  Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of prime brokerage BCB Group, said specialist cryptocurrency hedge funds based in London and the Cayman Islands had made orders in recent days.  Non-cryptocurrency funds worth around $100-200 million have this month registered interest with BCB Group but have not yet placed any orders, he said.

43,Bitcoin for payments a distant dream as usage dries up,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-payments-analysis/bitcoin-for-payments-a-distant-dream-as-usage-dries-up-idUSKCN1NP1D8,"November 20, 2018 07:46am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - The use of bitcoin for commercial payments has dropped dramatically this year, even as the original digital coin starts to fulfill one of the basic features of any payment currency: stability.  The value of bitcoins handled by major payment processors shriveled nearly 80 percent in the year to September, data from blockchain researcher Chainalysis shows. That suggests the cryptocurrency is struggling to mature from speculative asset to a serious alternative to state-issued money.  Months of relative calm in bitcoin prices after the wild swings of last winter had fueled hopes it would become widely used for payments, its intended purpose.  But its collapse in use as a payment currency has instead left big finance and crypto insiders eyeing better technological infrastructure to help bitcoin take off as a way to pay.  “There would have to be a stability requirement if it is to become another form of money,” said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS in London.  “But one thing that would take bitcoin into the mainstream is scalability — is it able to process the value or volume of transactions that money tends to do?”  The blockchain technology, where all bitcoin activity is recorded and validated, can only process a fraction of the transactions per second that major credit card companies can. That renders its mass use impractical.  Bitcoin still endures torrid swings in price, as this week’s 30 percent plunge shows. For a spell last month, though, the cryptocurrency was more stable than U.S. stocks.   Despite that growing stability, the value of bitcoin payments collapsed to $96 million in September from a December high of $427 million, the data from Chainalysis shows.  The firm surveyed 17 bitcoin payments processors, including Atlanta-based BitPay, one of the biggest. Most merchants that accept bitcoin do not do so directly, instead using intermediaries like BitPay to covert bitcoin to fiat currencies.  Comprehensive data on bitcoin used for payments is patchy, as trades with other currencies tend to be included along with its use for commercial payments.  That said, separate figures for individual payments processors reflect the downward trend. At Vancouver-based Coinpayments, for example, incoming and outgoing transactions slumped by more than half between January and October, according to blockchain analysis site OXT.  Coinpayments did not respond to requests for comment.  “Bitcoin payments processing is seeing a slow but consistent decline,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at research firm Autonomous Next, of the data on Coinpayments.  Through its first decade, Bitcoin has attracted a mix of investors, some convinced that it can reshape global finance by displacing traditional means of payments and others attracted by rapid gains that pushed it close to $20,000 in December.  It has since lost three-quarters of its value, falling below $4,500 on Tuesday, burning businesses along the way that had hoped to profit from growing investor interest.  Chip designer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), for example, saw its shares fall sharply last week after it blamed disappointing results on unsold chips piling up after the cryptocurrency mining boom evaporated.  Bitcoin’s relative stability this year has nevertheless raised expectations that its payments use by both individuals and companies will spread.  “The lack of volatility is a good step in the right direction that starts to make it viable for some of the non-retail use cases,” said Zeeshan Feroz, UK CEO of Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.  But both mainstream financial firms and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs say stability is not enough.  To gain traction, bitcoin needs to be faster and cheaper, they say. Clearer rules on an asset that has vexed financial regulators across the world would also help to give users a sense of legitimacy, UBS’s Teves said.  While coordinated regulation remains far off, some developments designed to address the so-called “scalability” problem — how many transactions per second the bitcoin network can handle — are underway.  Though in its infancy, the lightning network — code that can be added to the bitcoin blockchain designed to make payments faster and cheaper — is growing in use and capacity.  The network this week reached a record 4,101 “nodes” or computers that run its software, according to data aggregator 1ML, a rise of more than a quarter since August.  Lightning is popular, users say, because it allows users to send money to one another instead of having to complete time-consuming transactions on the blockchain.  “Lightning solves some of bitcoin’s scaling issue,” said Ed Cooper, who oversees cryptocurrencies at fintech startup Revolut. “It’s getting payments into the wild, into the bitcoin network.

Many fans dreamed the cryptocurrency would consign conventional finance to the dustbin, but a drop below $5,000 is proving it to be more vulnerable than stocks and bonds to investor funk. Bitcoin’s flaw remains its lack of fundamental value.  Since it was created nearly a decade ago, bitcoin has captured the fantasy of technologists and libertarians alike. It promised a world of frictionless finance, with consumers and companies sending money whipping around the world without the predations of banks or governments. Its sudden surge last year to nearly $20,000 pulled skeptical investors off the sidelines and fueled the issuance of hundreds of would-be imitators.   That now all seems woefully premature, if not misguided. The initial coin-offering boom turned bust this year as regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on them, and the EOS network got embroiled in a governance dispute immediately after raising a record $4.2 billion.   Meanwhile, the luring of conventional investors appears to have backfired. As many as 150 hedge funds dedicated to cryptocurrencies will be launched this year, publication Crypto Fund Research predicts. Most of them, though, will already be nursing big losses, having bought closer to the peak. The recent selling - bitcoin has plummeted by a third in a month and is 75 percent off its peak last December - has the air of investor capitulation.   There is no shortage of reasons to unload. Bitcoin cash, which developers hived off from bitcoin a year ago to foster faster transaction times, split itself into rival currencies earlier this month. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, called earlier this month for central banks to consider issuing their own currencies, which could overshadow bitcoin. And the broader investing climate has taken a harsh turn with fears of trade wars and higher interest rates causing prices of stocks and bonds to drop.  With a fresh fall of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, the S&P 500 Index was down 10 percent from its September high. That’s punishing for investors, but S&P 500 companies grew earnings by nearly 29 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, and are expected to continue to expand profit in 2019.

Volatility of the original and biggest cryptocurrency has sunk to its lowest for nearly two years, with price swings falling lower than increasingly edgy U.S. stocks for more than two weeks in a row.  Measured on a weekly basis, bitcoin volatility is set to fall to its lowest since the end of 2016, when the digital coin was still a niche asset yet to muscle its way into global focus.  Volatility has been a major characteristic of the digital currency, which turned 10-years-old last week, throwing up major hurdles to its emergence as a mainstream asset class.   Most mainstream institutional investors, skeptical about its ability to store value in any predictable way, have also stayed clear. At the same time, regulators across the globe have emphasized price instability when issuing warnings to retail investors dabbling in the cryptocurrency.  Volatility has also prevented the spread of bitcoin as a method of payments, its intended purpose.  Traders and investors are waiting for clarity on how regulators will treat bitcoin products such as exchange-traded funds, leading to them holding off on major purchases or sales.  A fall in trading volumes over the last three months is also a key factor, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a cryptocurrency prime broker.  In contrast to bitcoin, volatility in the S&P 500 .SPX, has since late September climbed to near seven-month highs. Investors in U.S. stocks are worried over rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and global trade and protectionism.  Bitcoin soared over 1,300 percent last year to a record high of almost $20,000 in December. This year it has slumped as much as 70 percent, before settling into a period of relative stability since September.  On Tuesday it was trading at around $6,420.

47,Bitcoin sinks as cryptocurrency sell-off gathers pace,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1NV118,"November 26, 2018 01:22pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged more than 12 percent on Monday, extending falls in recent weeks in a broad-based selloff in digital currencies as sentiment sours.   Several factors have accelerated the downturn, analysts said, including increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny and a delay to January 2019 of the widely-anticipated launch of bitcoin futures by Bakkt, Intercontinental Exchange’s crypto platform.  “These factors coupled with lukewarm network fundamentals and reports of falling adoption of crypto as a tool for services such as payments, have led to strong selling pressure against a lack of buying resistance — to a point of apparent capitulation,” said Aditya Das, analyst at Brave New Coin, a crypto asset market data company.  Bitcoin fell to as low as $3,519.94 on the Bitstamp platform, after earlier falling to a 14-month trough of $3,462,57, and was last down 12.6 percent. It has lost 74 percent of its value so far this year, after hitting nearly $20,000 in December last year.  Other digital currencies also fell sharply, with Ethereum’s ether down 7 percent at $106.69 and Ripple’s XRP falling 5.6 percent to 34 U.S. cents.  Cryptocurrency market capitalization plummeted to $122.3 billion on Monday, down 85 percent from its peak of nearly $800 billion hit in early January this year.  Mainstream investors have stayed clear of bitcoin, with concerns over scant regulatory oversight and undeveloped market infrastructure compounded by frequent swings in price.  Analysts said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was partly to blame for the recent sell-off, with the delay in its approval of new bitcoin instruments, as well as for its investigations of initial coin offerings and crypto exchanges.  The SEC has ordered civil penalties against Airfox and Paragon Coin that sold digital tokens deemed as securities in initial coin offerings. Those companies have agreed to return funds to harmed investors, register the tokens as securities, file periodic reports with the Commission, and pay penalties.  Bloomberg reported this month that the U.S. Department of Justice had initiated an investigation of cryptocurrency Tether over possible manipulation of bitcoin prices at the end of last year.  At the same time, the sharp price falls are seen by some as an opportunity to get into viable cryptocurrency projects at a discounted price.  “It is important to highlight that none of the unpleasant headlines are directly related to the underlying fundamentals of legitimate cryptocurrency projects,” said Donald Bullers, North American representative of web3 infrastructure platform Elastos.  “Whether it’s market manipulation accusations, a controversial fork, or short-term speculators deciding not to play the long game, this dip will cull the wheat from the chaff and the most important decentralization projects will continue to survive,” he added.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.  The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to over 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.  It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has have until May 7 to comment on the draft.  State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday that the draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” towards the cryptocurrency industry.  The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.  China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.  Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear.

51,Breakingviews - Bitcoin remains a triumph of hope over experience,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N52RV,"October 31, 2018 03:50pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bitcoin’s short history is a triumph of hope over experience. The digital money is marking its first decade with a punishing slump. Fraud and regulatory zeal have dried up the issuance of rival cryptocurrencies. The underlying blockchain technology has yet to produce its first killer app. It’s a long way from the revolution envisaged by founder Satoshi Nakamoto.  She, he or they – Satoshi’s identity remains a mystery – wanted to give people a way to securely transfer money without banks or governments. The cocktail of tech cleverness, post-crisis distrust of the establishment and dreams of digital riches eventually proved irresistible. Bitcoin surged 20-fold last year and developers raised nearly $20 billion in just 18 months by issuing digital tokens in so-called initial coin offerings. They aimed to build everything from rival monies to secure messaging systems to prediction markets.  It was too good to be true. In June cybersecurity outfit Carbon Black estimated hackers stole $1.1 billion of cryptocurrency in just six months. Hundreds of tokens have gone defunct, victims of everything from outright scams to bad ideas and poor execution. China cracked down on crypto miners – who verify transactions and release new currency units – and offshore trading this year, having already banned domestic trading in 2017. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blocked several proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds and said most token offerings should be subject to securities laws.  Bitcoin’s price has plummeted by 68 percent since its December 2017 peak. Slow transaction times and huge energy needs of miners mean it’s unlikely to ever be anything more than a speculative vehicle. The ICO craze has fizzled, and no blockchain application has gained mass acceptance. By contrast, a decade after Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web, AOL was merging with Time Warner and six-year-old Amazon had sales of nearly $3 billion.  Nakamoto’s dream lives on, though. Venture capital from the likes of Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz is rapidly replacing ICOs as a source of finance for blockchain developers. Mutual-fund giant Fidelity is creating a subsidiary to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services to institutional investors. San Francisco-based Coinbase, an exchange and digital wallet provider, raised $300 million this week, valuing it at nearly $8 billion. Perhaps another decade will see those investments bear fruit.

Early this week, the cryptocurrency world was racked by news South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb was hacked of 35 billion won ($31.5 million) worth of virtual coins.  The Bithumb attack was preceded earlier this month by a “cyber intrusion” at Coinrail, a relatively small cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, causing a loss of about 30 percent of the coins traded on the exchange.  “Often swings in prices are blamed on events like hacks of crypto exchanges, or news from regulators,” said Chris Tse, founding director of the Cardstack project in New York, which is leading efforts to create a new blockchain-based internet.

There was massive exuberance, then a massive crash, and now we’re cleaning up the debris and figuring out what’s going on,” Tse said.

55,Belarus allows traders to buy shares with bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1ZF41Y,"January 15, 2019 09:40am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus launched a platform on Tuesday allowing traders to buy shares, gold, foreign exchange and other traditional assets with cryptocurrencies, which it says is the world’s first regulated tokenized securities exchange.  Belarus has developed a flourishing IT industry and launched a series of business-friendly reforms after a 2015-2016 recession. It passed a law in December 2017 on cryptocurrencies, aiming for them to become a way for companies in the country to attract funding from foreign investors.   The government has not commented on the new platform but its launch was covered by the state news agency BelTa on Tuesday.  The platform allows traders to buy tokens using cryptocurrencies through a website or app. The tokens track the value of assets such as shares both in Belarus and abroad. The government allowed such transactions to be tax-free until 2023.   The project was launched by two IT-focused investment companies, VP Capital and Larnabel Ventures.   “This is the first platform in the world where cryptoinvestors will be able to diversify their investments into real assets,” VP Capital’s owner Viktor Prokopenya told Reuters.    The platform issued 150 types of tokens corresponding to traditional financial instruments on Tuesday, and expects to increase that to 10,000. Among other things, the platform offers the sale of shares in companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), gold, oil and metals.   Within the first two hours, it received 2,000 applications for registration. According to Prokopenya, a trader must undergo a verification procedure to guard against money laundering.  Virtual currencies are volatile and fell sharply year amid increased regulatory scrutiny and amid some instances of hacks and thefts at crypto exchanges.   “The standards that have been developed in Belarus are correct, they correspond to accepted international practices,” Prokopenya said.   “We believe that this project will allow Belarusian companies to attract additional funding both domestically and externally,” he added. “Because at the moment the stock market of Belarus is far from the state in which it should be.”  The former Soviet republic, squeezed between Russia and the European Union, is still dominated by the state, weighed down by bureaucracy and inefficient state-owned enterprises, and sustained by Russian money and subsidies.  But despite President Alexander Lukashenko once referring to the internet as “garbage”, the authorities have offered benefits to the IT industry such as tax breaks.   The sector has grown by around 20 percent annually. IT exports grew 40 percent in the first nine months of 2018, having crossed $1 billion for the first time in 2017.

58,Daily bitcoin transactions on darknet markets doubled throughout 2018: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1PC1OE,"January 18, 2019 12:03pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Use of bitcoin as a form of payment doubled in 2018 on darknet market sites, where users can buy anything from illegal drugs to fake IDs, even though the price of the cryptocurrency crashed, according to a study by data firm Chainalysis.    Bitcoin transaction volumes on darknet markets rose throughout 2018 to an average of $2 million daily, nearly double the activity measured at the start of the year, according to Chainalysis.  Overall bitcoin flowing into darknet markets fell to $600 million in 2018 from $700 million a year earlier, Chainalysis found. The dip was attributable to the closure of major markets AlphaBay and Hansa in mid-2017 which hampered flows until the start of last year when transaction volumes started to steadily grow again, Kim Grauer, senior economist at Chainalysis, said in an interview.   “The reason for that drop is more law enforcement activity,” Grauer said. “It would be misleading to think that this year it (the volume) will go down.”  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is a popular form of payment on darknet markets because users do not need to reveal their identities.  In 2017 bitcoin became wildly popular with speculators who trade it online against other virtual currencies as well as hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin’s price peaked in December 2017 at just above $20,000 and is now down more than 80 percent from its high.  While bitcoin’s volatility has attracted speculators, it has prevented it from becoming a more widespread form of payment in mainstream commerce. The value of bitcoins handled by major payment processors shriveled nearly 80 percent in the year to September, earlier data from Chainalysis showed.  The wild price swings have not dissuaded darknet users, Grauer said.  “For someone who wants to buy something on a dark marketplace, the fact that bitcoin price is fluctuating doesn’t really matter,” Grauer said.  However several factors could disrupt the rise of bitcoin flows into these markets this year. These include more closures of markets by law enforcement and the movement of activity from these venues to encrypted messaging apps to avoid detection, Grauer said.

The fund is under the supervision of Liechtenstein’s financial regulator.  Both companies, however, did not disclose the size of the fund, which was developed by Final Frontier for institutional and professional investors to gain access to the esoteric world of bitcoin mining.      Bitcoin mining entails updating the ledger of bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. Miners run extremely powerful computers in a race against other miners to guess a specific number. The first miner to guess the number gets to update the ledger of transactions and also receives a reward of 12.5 newly minted bitcoins.  Bitfury, which holds a minority stake in Switzerland-based Final Frontier, said in a statement it is providing the hardware and end-to-end services for the bitcoin mining fund. The mining sites where the equipment will be deployed will be in locations scouted and serviced by Bitfury.  The fund will invest in turnkey assets consisting of mining sites with some of the lowest electricity and operating costs globally that feature Bitfury data centers, both companies said.  Imraan Moola, co-founder of Final Frontier, said the firm is launching the fund at an advantageous time for investors. “With the bitcoin price down significantly from its all-time high, yet institutional interest growing every day, now may be an opportune time to consider investing in bitcoin mining,” Moola said.  Bitcoin has trended higher the last few weeks, trading up nearly 4 percent at $5,594.65 on the Bitstamp platform late Tuesday.   That rally has made bitcoin mining more profitable, said crypto analyst Alex Kruger, noting that profits have risen since the start of April.  He said on Twitter that the break-even cost for efficient bitcoin mining operations currently hovers around $3,550 to $4,350, while the price of bitcoin is in the $5,500-plus range. That ensures a $1,000-plus profit for each bitcoin mined.

66,ALTCOINS-Rise of smaller rivals throws up fresh challenge to bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N2204RZ,"May 15, 2019 01:38am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s weathered hacks, heists, booms and busts to reign as the king of cryptocurrencies through its first decade. But now there’s a fresh challenge to its dominance of the fledgling market: some 2,000 smaller digital coins.  Collectively, “altcoins” are gaining ground on their bigger cousin. Individually, they are gaining traction among users, gathering communities of developers and users often deeply devoted to their goals.  Bitcoin now accounts for around 60% of the $240 billion crypto market, down from nearly 90% just over two years ago. That fading dominance reflects tough times for the original cryptocurrency since its late 2017 apex.  Bitcoin has almost doubled in value this year, rallying nearly 30% in recent days to touch its highest level in ten months on Tuesday. But last year it lost three-quarters of its value.  That volatility has put off mainstream investors from pension funds to asset managers who are seen as crucial to bitcoin’s growth from speculative token to established asset.  Bitcoin has also struggled for traction as means of payment, its intended usage. Few but cryptocurrency diehards go shopping with the digital currency.  Enter the altcoins.  Binance Coin and Bitcoin Cash, Tether, Monero and Dash: The diversity of their names reflects myriad protocols and groups of users, traders and developers behind them.  They also suffer from high volatility and few are used for mainstream payments. But playing out in their growth is a slow-burn tussle that analysts and academics describe as a race to find the answers to bitcoin’s flaws. It’s one that could shape the evolution of cryptocurrencies and related technologies like blockchain.   The two biggest altcoins, Ethereum and XRP, together account for about a fifth of the coin market, with respective circulations of $22 billion and $17 billion. Others, with names like AnarchistCoin and CryptoPing, are illiquid and seldom used.  “Their proliferation is driven by the need to spark new innovation – security innovations, or a new algorithm that allows faster transaction to a new blockchain,” said Paolo Tasca, who runs University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies.   The emergence of a de facto “money of the internet” - a digital coin that is recognized and accepted online - is widely seen as a prerequisite for cryptocurrencies to break through into the mainstream.  Bitcoin, seen as the most likely to take that mantle, has mostly failed to live up to its billing.  Without doubt, it’s the most well-known of its kind. And to the extent they do look at cryptocurrencies, larger investors tend to gravitate towards bitcoin.  But its use in commerce is hamstrung by high transaction costs and low speed. And for all its proponents’ claims that it is “digital gold,” bitcoin’s volatility means that it is highly impractical as a store of value.  “Bitcoin was designed to be the money of the internet, but that was a very early idea,” said Hugo Volz Oliviera, an analyst at trading platform London Block Exchange. “Other projects have tried to fill the gap that exists.”   Some, like ethereum, power blockchain-based applications.

67,Daily bitcoin transactions on darknet markets doubled throughout 2018 -report,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1ZH1GI,"January 18, 2019 09:19am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Use of bitcoin as a form of payment doubled in 2018 on darknet market sites, where users can buy anything from illegal drugs to fake IDs, even though the price of the cryptocurrency crashed, according to a study by data firm Chainalysis.    Bitcoin transaction volumes on darknet markets rose throughout 2018 to an average of $2 million daily, nearly double the activity measured at the start of the year, according to Chainalysis.  Overall bitcoin flowing into darknet markets fell to $600 million in 2018 from $700 million a year earlier, Chainalysis found. The dip was attributable to the closure of major markets AlphaBay and Hansa in mid-2017 which hampered flows until the start of last year when transaction volumes started to steadily grow again, Kim Grauer, senior economist at Chainalysis, said in an interview.   “The reason for that drop is more law enforcement activity,” Grauer said. “It would be misleading to think that this year it (the volume) will go down.”  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is a popular form of payment on darknet markets because users do not need to reveal their identities.  In 2017 bitcoin became wildly popular with speculators who trade it online against other virtual currencies as well as hard currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin’s price peaked in December 2017 at just above $20,000 and is now down more than 80 percent from its high.  While bitcoin’s volatility has attracted speculators, it has prevented it from becoming a more widespread form of payment in mainstream commerce. The value of bitcoins handled by major payment processors shriveled nearly 80 percent in the year to September, earlier data from Chainalysis showed.  The wild price swings have not dissuaded darknet users, Grauer said.  “For someone who wants to buy something on a dark marketplace, the fact that bitcoin price is fluctuating doesn’t really matter,” Grauer said.  However several factors could disrupt the rise of bitcoin flows into these markets this year. These include more closures of markets by law enforcement and the movement of activity from these venues to encrypted messaging apps to avoid detection, Grauer said.

68,Rise of smaller rivals throws up fresh challenge to bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-altcoins/rise-of-smaller-rivals-throws-up-fresh-challenge-to-bitcoin-idUSKCN1SL0FC,"May 15, 2019 04:41am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s weathered hacks, heists, booms and busts to reign as the king of cryptocurrencies through its first decade. But now there’s a fresh challenge to its dominance of the fledgling market: some 2,000 smaller digital coins.  Collectively, “altcoins” are gaining ground on their bigger cousin. Individually, they are gaining traction among users, gathering communities of developers and users often deeply devoted to their goals.  Bitcoin now accounts for around 60% of the $240 billion crypto market, down from nearly 90% just over two years ago. That fading dominance reflects tough times for the original cryptocurrency since its late 2017 apex.  Bitcoin has almost doubled in value this year, rallying nearly 30% in recent days to touch its highest level in ten months on Tuesday. But last year it lost three-quarters of its value.  That volatility has put off mainstream investors from pension funds to asset managers who are seen as crucial to bitcoin’s growth from speculative token to established asset.  Bitcoin has also struggled for traction as means of payment, its intended usage. Few but cryptocurrency diehards go shopping with the digital currency.  Enter the altcoins.  Binance Coin and Bitcoin Cash, Tether, Monero and Dash: The diversity of their names reflects myriad protocols and groups of users, traders and developers behind them.  They also suffer from high volatility and few are used for mainstream payments. But playing out in their growth is a slow-burn tussle that analysts and academics describe as a race to find the answers to bitcoin’s flaws. It’s one that could shape the evolution of cryptocurrencies and related technologies like blockchain.   The two biggest altcoins, Ethereum and XRP, together account for about a fifth of the coin market, with respective circulations of $22 billion and $17 billion. Others, with names like AnarchistCoin and CryptoPing, are illiquid and seldom used.  “Their proliferation is driven by the need to spark new innovation – security innovations, or a new algorithm that allows faster transaction to a new blockchain,” said Paolo Tasca, who runs University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies.   The emergence of a de facto “money of the internet” - a digital coin that is recognized and accepted online - is widely seen as a prerequisite for cryptocurrencies to break through into the mainstream.  Bitcoin, seen as the most likely to take that mantle, has mostly failed to live up to its billing.  Without doubt, it’s the most well-known of its kind. And to the extent they do look at cryptocurrencies, larger investors tend to gravitate towards bitcoin.  But its use in commerce is hamstrung by high transaction costs and low speed. And for all its proponents’ claims that it is “digital gold,” bitcoin’s volatility means that it is highly impractical as a store of value.  “Bitcoin was designed to be the money of the internet, but that was a very early idea,” said Hugo Volz Oliviera, an analyst at trading platform London Block Exchange. “Other projects have tried to fill the gap that exists.”   Some, like ethereum, power blockchain-based applications. Others, known as “stablecoins,” look to overcome the problems associated with wild price fluctuations by being pegged to fiat currency.  A bigger proportion still are essentially clones of bitcoin, offering little in the way of radically difficult uses. Some, such as Litecoin, are designed to tackle some of bitcoin’s weaknesses, such as slow transactions.

69,Producing bitcoin currency could void climate change efforts - scientists,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1X97C3,"October 29, 2018 06:07pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Demand for bitcoin could single-handedly derail efforts to limit global warming because the increasingly popular digital currency takes huge amounts of energy to produce, scientists said on Monday.  Producing bitcoin at a pace with growing demand could by 2033 defeat the aim of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to U.S. research published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  Almost 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 on the goal to keep warming to “well below” a rise of 2°C above pre-industrial times.  But mining, the process of producing bitcoins by solving mathematical equations, uses high-powered computers and alto of electricity, the researchers said.  “Currently, the emissions from transportation, housing and food are considered the main contributors to ongoing climate change,” said study co-author Katie Taladay in a statement. “This research illustrates that bitcoin should be added to this list.”  Mining is a lucrative business, with one bitcoin currently selling for about $6,300 (4,900 British pounds).  In 2017, bitcoin production and usage emitted an estimated 69 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the researchers said.  That year, bitcoin was involved in less than half of 1 percent of the world’s cashless transactions, they said.  As the currency becomes more common, researchers said it could use enough electricity to emit about 230 gigatonnes of carbon within a decade and a half. One gigatonne is equal to one billion metric tons of carbon.  “No matter how you slice it, that thing is using a lot of electricity. That means bad business for the environment,” Camilo Mora, another co-author, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Bitcoin mining, however, is becoming more energy efficient, said Katrina Kelly-Pitou, research associate at the University of Pittsburgh.  She said bitcoin miners are moving away from sites such as China, with coal-generated electricity, to more environmentally friendly utilities in Iceland and the United States.

Bitcoin surged to near $20,000 in late 2017, the peak of a bubble driven by retail investors. But last year prices collapsed by three-quarters, with trading dominated by smaller hedge funds and crypto-related firms.  Today’s gain was probably triggered by an order worth about $100 million spread across U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm BCB Group.   “There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC,” he said.   “If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour”.

The exchange-traded product, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which is subject to a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The companies said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organized “over-the counter” bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency.  Van Eck, which had $46 billion in assets under management, and several other fund managers had previously pushed for exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures instead of directly investing in the cryptocurrency.  This was to address concerns that bitcoin exchanges were not regulated by traditional financial market overseers, unlike the futures market.  The SEC has either denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, joining a long list of regulators that have taken a tough stance against products and securities related to digital currencies.      Van Eck and SolidX hope to list the product on the Cboe exchange under the symbol “XBTC”.

Volatility of the original and biggest cryptocurrency has sunk to its lowest for nearly two years, with price swings falling lower than increasingly edgy U.S. stocks for more than two weeks in a row.  Measured on a weekly basis, bitcoin volatility is set to fall to its lowest since the end of 2016, when the digital coin was still a niche asset yet to muscle its way into global focus.  Volatility has been a major characteristic of the digital currency, which turned 10-years-old last week, throwing up major hurdles to its emergence as a mainstream asset class.   Most mainstream institutional investors, skeptical about its ability to store value in any predictable way, have also stayed clear. At the same time, regulators across the globe have emphasized price instability when issuing warnings to retail investors dabbling in the cryptocurrency.  Volatility has also prevented the spread of bitcoin as a method of payments, its intended purpose.  Traders and investors are waiting for clarity on how regulators will treat bitcoin products such as exchange-traded funds, leading to them holding off on major purchases or sales.  A fall in trading volumes over the last three months is also a key factor, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a cryptocurrency prime broker.  In contrast to bitcoin, volatility in the S&P 500 .SPX, has since late September climbed to near seven-month highs. Investors in U.S. stocks are worried over rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and global trade and protectionism.  Bitcoin soared over 1,300 percent last year to a record high of almost $20,000 in December. This year it has slumped as much as 70 percent, before settling into a period of relative stability since September.  On Tuesday it was trading at around $6,420.

89,Producing bitcoin currency could void climate change efforts - scientists,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N32RK,"October 29, 2018 06:11pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Demand for bitcoin could single-handedly derail efforts to limit global warming because the increasingly popular digital currency takes huge amounts of energy to produce, scientists said on Monday.  Producing bitcoin at a pace with growing demand could by 2033 defeat the aim of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to U.S. research published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  Almost 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 on the goal to keep warming to “well below” a rise of 2°C above pre-industrial times.  But mining, the process of producing bitcoins by solving mathematical equations, uses high-powered computers and alto of electricity, the researchers said.  “Currently, the emissions from transportation, housing and food are considered the main contributors to ongoing climate change,” said study co-author Katie Taladay in a statement. “This research illustrates that bitcoin should be added to this list.”  Mining is a lucrative business, with one bitcoin currently selling for about $6,300 (4,900 British pounds).  In 2017, bitcoin production and usage emitted an estimated 69 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the researchers said.  That year, bitcoin was involved in less than half of 1 percent of the world’s cashless transactions, they said.  As the currency becomes more common, researchers said it could use enough electricity to emit about 230 gigatonnes of carbon within a decade and a half. One gigatonne is equal to one billion metric tons of carbon.  “No matter how you slice it, that thing is using a lot of electricity. That means bad business for the environment,” Camilo Mora, another co-author, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Bitcoin mining, however, is becoming more energy efficient, said Katrina Kelly-Pitou, research associate at the University of Pittsburgh.  She said bitcoin miners are moving away from sites such as China, with coal-generated electricity, to more environmentally friendly utilities in Iceland and the United States.

90,Bitcoin trading volume hits two-year low in March -report,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N21M1NW,"April 04, 2019 04:54pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s trading volume dropped to a two-year low in March, digital currency trading tool provider TradeBlock said in a report on Thursday, as investors remained spooked by increased regulatory scrutiny.  Bitcoin volume in the top five digital currency exchanges totaled $2.14 billion last month, the lowest since April 2017 when volume was just $845.7 million.  The original cryptocurrency, bitcoin has dropped more than 70 percent since hitting an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, a slump that has spread to all digital currencies.  A global regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created concerns about greater oversight and acceptance of digital currencies as payments, taking the wind out of the once red-hot virtual assets.  Early this week, however, bitcoin recovered somewhat to hit a roughly five-month high of $5,345 on the Bitstamp platform, after a major order by an anonymous buyer set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading, analysts said.  TradeBlock said in its research that as bitcoin trading volumes fell, digital asset exchanges started increasing the number of assets listed. It cited Coinbase, which has historically listed fewer assets than its peers, taking on two new currencies - Ripple and Stellar Lumens - over the last few months.    Coinbase’s trading volume for March was $1.6 billion, a two-year low as well, TradeBlock data showed.

Bitcoin volume in the top five digital currency exchanges totaled $2.14 billion last month, the lowest since April 2017 when volume was just $845.7 million.  The original cryptocurrency, bitcoin has dropped more than 70 percent since hitting an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, a slump that has spread to all digital currencies.  A global regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has created concerns about greater oversight and acceptance of digital currencies as payments, taking the wind out of the once red-hot virtual assets.  Early this week, however, bitcoin recovered somewhat to hit a roughly five-month high of $5,345 on the Bitstamp platform, after a major order by an anonymous buyer set off a frenzy of computer-driven trading, analysts said.  TradeBlock said in its research that as bitcoin trading volumes fell, digital asset exchanges started increasing the number of assets listed. It cited Coinbase, which has historically listed fewer assets than its peers, taking on two new currencies - Ripple and Stellar Lumens - over the last few months.    Coinbase’s trading volume for March was $1.6 billion, a two-year low as well, TradeBlock data showed.  TradeBlock’s research also showed that as volumes declined, digital currency exchanges began raising trading fees in 2018 and 2019.  “An increase in trading fees is in line with expectations that exchanges are looking to protect revenues, amidst continually dampened trading volumes,” TradeBlock said.

92,"Rapid bitcoin rally cheers crypto market investors, others wary",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N22Q3U3,"May 14, 2019 12:57pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin hit its highest level in 10 months on Tuesday, raising hopes among cryptocurrency enthusiasts of greater mainstream acceptance as an escalating U.S.-China trade war roiled global markets, but others urged investor caution.  Bitcoin, which lost three-quarters of its value in 2018, has soared by 24% since Friday and more than doubled in price so far this year. At 1612 GMT it was up 0.8% at 7,874..  There was no obvious reason for the sudden rise with the opacity of cryptocurrency markets rendering it virtually impossible to prove or disprove any theories.  Some traders said investors moved money to bitcoin, treating it as a safe haven as traditional financial markets stumbled on fears that a worsening Sino-U.S. trade dispute could derail the global economy.  But none of the four traders that Reuters spoke to could produce evidence to support that claim.  “Some say buying bitcoin could be a flight to safety for people who view it as a gold-type asset,” said Aliya Itzkowitz at crypto research firm Enigma Securities.           “I don’t subscribe to that view. I view bitcoin as a high-risk, high-growth asset – a bet on an emerging technology.”     Some traders said the prospect of major firms, including Starbucks, to accept digital money were fuelling hopes that bitcoin would gain use among mainstream consumers - something that has previously eluded it.   Others cited reports that Fidelity Investments would soon offer cryptocurrency trading for the rally.  Unexplained price swings have been par for the course during bitcoin’s first decade. Just last month, bitcoin had its biggest daily gain for a year, leaving investors puzzling over the cause of the move.  Whatever the reason, price moves of such dramatic scale are a reminder that cryptocurrencies remain a highly speculative market where prices are not linked to factors such as technological development, some industry officials said.  “I don’t like to see these price swings. They are not healthy,” said Nicholas Gregory of the blockchain company Commerce Block. “Whether that’s happening because they believe in the tech, or people hedging - you just don’t know”.   The lack of transparency in crypto markets could thwart hopes that digital money can progress from speculative tokens to an asset accepted by mainstream investors, some analysts said.   “If most of the regulators and traders themselves are only vaguely aware of what is likely to happen in the next few days or weeks, then clearly the levels of risk associated with investing are very high,” said Windsor Holden of Juniper Research, an analysis firm specializing in fintech.

93,UPDATE 1-Bitcoin sinks as cryptocurrency sell-off gathers pace,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1Y14VQ,"November 26, 2018 01:15pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged more than 12 percent on Monday, extending falls in recent weeks in a broad-based selloff in digital currencies as sentiment sours.   Several factors have accelerated the downturn, analysts said, including increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny and a delay to January 2019 of the widely-anticipated launch of bitcoin futures by Bakkt, Intercontinental Exchange’s crypto platform.  “These factors coupled with lukewarm network fundamentals and reports of falling adoption of crypto as a tool for services such as payments, have led to strong selling pressure against a lack of buying resistance — to a point of apparent capitulation,” said Aditya Das, analyst at Brave New Coin, a crypto asset market data company.  Bitcoin fell to as low as $3,519.94 on the Bitstamp platform, after earlier falling to a 14-month trough of $3,462,57, and was last down 12.6 percent. It has lost 74 percent of its value so far this year, after hitting nearly $20,000 in December last year.  Other digital currencies also fell sharply, with Ethereum’s ether down 7 percent at $106.69 and Ripple’s XRP falling 5.6 percent to 34 U.S. cents.  Cryptocurrency market capitalization plummeted to $122.3 billion on Monday, down 85 percent from its peak of nearly $800 billion hit in early January this year.  Mainstream investors have stayed clear of bitcoin, with concerns over scant regulatory oversight and undeveloped market infrastructure compounded by frequent swings in price.  Analysts said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was partly to blame for the recent sell-off, with the delay in its approval of new bitcoin instruments, as well as for its investigations of initial coin offerings and crypto exchanges.  The SEC has ordered civil penalties against Airfox and Paragon Coin that sold digital tokens deemed as securities in initial coin offerings. Those companies have agreed to return funds to harmed investors, register the tokens as securities, file periodic reports with the Commission, and pay penalties.  Bloomberg reported this month that the U.S. Department of Justice had initiated an investigation of cryptocurrency Tether over possible manipulation of bitcoin prices at the end of last year.  At the same time, the sharp price falls are seen by some as an opportunity to get into viable cryptocurrency projects at a discounted price.  “It is important to highlight that none of the unpleasant headlines are directly related to the underlying fundamentals of legitimate cryptocurrency projects,” said Donald Bullers, North American representative of web3 infrastructure platform Elastos.  “Whether it’s market manipulation accusations, a controversial fork, or short-term speculators deciding not to play the long game, this dip will cull the wheat from the chaff and the most important decentralization projects will continue to survive,” he added.

96,"As bitcoin trading shifts shape, big money stays away",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1O61SH,"December 17, 2018 07:20am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (This version of the December 7th story corrects spelling of first name to Erik (not Eric) in paragraph 21)  By Tom Wilson  LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s value has plunged by three-quarters this year, sending the original and biggest cryptocurrency back to levels not seen before its bubble. And price isn’t the only aspect of trading that has changed.   The retail investors behind bitcoin’s dizzying ascent to a record of nearly $20,000 last December have fled, leaving the early adopters and crypto-related firms that traditionally dominated digital coin trading driving exchange volumes.   And while bigger investors from proprietary traders to hedge funds are growing more active, mainstream financial firms have stayed away from cryptocurrencies, even as market infrastructure seen as key to their entry begins to be built.  The shifting shape of digital coin trading, depicted by industry data and interviews with exchanges and companies, suggests bitcoin is struggling to evolve from a speculative asset favored by relatively niche investors to an investment choice in the same league as stocks or bonds.  Such an institutional breakthrough is seen as key to the sector’s future, promising to help fund the development of cryptocurrencies and spread their real-world use for purposes like payments and money transfers.  Monthly cryptocurrency trading volumes at major exchanges reached $235.8 billion in November, a threefold rise from the early stages of the bitcoin bubble in September 2017 but still down nearly half from their peak a year ago, data from industry website CryptoCompare shows.   (For a graphic on 'Crypto trading volumes' click tmsnrt.rs/2RHuVAI)  In the same period, volumes at major retail-focused exchanges such as U.S.-based Coinbase and Poloniex, owned by Goldman Sachs-backed Circle, shrank 22 percent and 74 percent respectively. Japan’s bitFlyer has also suffered, with volumes down 47 percent last month.   As retail punters fade away, volumes have soared at exchanges such as Bitfinex that are favored by bigger investors. That’s down to growing activity by a mixture of cryptocurrency miners and startups with big holdings, plus prop traders, hedge funds and wealthy individuals and families, say industry insiders.   Bitfinex trading volumes climbed 38 percent in November, which the firm attributes to traditional investors with roots in high-frequency trading opening accounts since March.     “You’ve got the larger exchanges picking up the slack and making gains of market share, with retail exchanges stepping back,” said CryptoCompare’s Charlie Hayter.  “That’s the real shift — the (cryptocurrency) mining companies looking to pay their electricity bills using the exchanges that operate with larger players, and newer entrants trying to gain some form of exposure.”  Asked about the figures, Coinbase said trading in the crypto sector was growing. Poloniex said the data reflected moves in the wider market. BitFlyer declined to comment.  CryptoCompare’s data covers most of the biggest exchanges, with the company adding new exchanges to its database when their volumes hit significant levels.   Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was trading on Friday at 15-month lows around $3,400.   Cryptocurrency markets are hard to accurately gauge, given the lack of centralized data and opacity of major venues such as over-the-counter trading, said to account for up to 50 percent of the overall market.   Likewise, there are few ways to accurately break down the profile of investors in the crypto market.  But exchanges and industry figures interviewed by Reuters said institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds and investment banks remain largely absent from bitcoin trading, even as the shape of the market changes.   Most worry about the lack of clarity over regulation, as well as frequent security breaches at exchanges and the perceived absence of fundamental value of the assets.   That reluctance has remained even as strides are made in how to securely trade and store cryptocurrencies, notably by Fidelity Investments, and as a number of small jurisdictions like Gibraltar and Malta look to license crypto companies.   Clearer regulation will lend a stamp of legitimacy to cryptocurrency companies and weed out sub-standard players, say analysts, and may ease institutional investors’ worries about compliance.  “Some individuals at banks and financial firms want to step in, but can’t decide how to explain it to senior management,” said Erik Wilgenhof Plante, chief compliance officer at BeQuant, an exchange that serves around 600 mostly non-retail clients.   One big hurdle is the lack of examples of blockchain, which underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, living up to its billing as a technology that could revolutionize sectors from finance to real estate.   Circle’s Chief Marketing Officer Marieke Flament said the focus on bitcoin often obscures advances being made in other areas of cryptocurrencies. She cited the startup’s own “stablecoin” digital currency, which is pegged one-to-one with the dollar and could appeal to institutional investors.  “There is still a lot of focus on bitcoin,” said Flament. “That is really missing the depth of the stuff that’s happening.”       But despite the work by startups and major firms, developers and exchanges, top-tier mainstream investors have stayed away.  “You have seen some landmark decisions by Fidelity to actively engage in the cryptocurrency space,” said Danny Masters, chairman of digital asset manager CoinShares.  “But nothing is actually active.”  Reporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Catherine Evans",0.16622499999999998,0.058175063507094754

99,Crypto hedge funds grew last year even as bitcoin slumped -report,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N22P304,"May 13, 2019 08:39am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency hedge funds managed three times more in investments in the first quarter of this year than in early 2018, a report by consultancy PwC and investment firm Elwood showed on Monday.  The research showed that crypto hedge funds managed a median $4.3 million between January and March, compared with $1.2 million in January 2018, suggesting demand for exposure to crypto held up even as bitcoin slumped in price by 75%.  The sums under management remain a fraction of those for more established assets.           Bitcoin, the original and best-known cryptocurrency, peaked in December 2017. Since then, the retail-oriented cryptocurrency market has become dominated by hedge funds, crypto-related companies and wealthy individuals, with individual investors mostly fleeing and mainstream investors largely absent.   The health of crypto hedge funds thus offers a window into demand for exposure to the wider market.   Several funds failed last year, the report said, leaving the industry highly fragmented. Around 150 active cryptocurrency hedge funds manage a collective $1 billion in assets, with more than six in 10 funds managing less than $10 million. Fewer than 10% oversee assets of over $50 million, the research showed.    “The crypto hedge fund industry today is probably where the traditional hedge fund industry was in the early 1990s,” Henri Arslanian, who oversees cryptocurrencies at PwC, said in a statement.  The report, based on conversations with managers at around 100 crypto hedge funds, showed that such funds suffered a median 46% loss last year.   “Quantitative” funds, which account for nearly four in 10 and employ methods including arbitrage and low latency trading, benefited from high volatility to return a median 8%.   “Fundamental” funds, which make longer-terms bets, delivered a loss of 53% - underscoring the perils in predicting the direction of digital assets in a market known for its opacity.  Bitcoin traded at around $7,300 on Monday, close to nine-month highs, as the biggest cryptocurrency’s 2019 rally gathered momentum. It soared 14% on Saturday — its second largest daily jump this year — to its highest since early August.

The 7,000 bitcoin were withdrawn by hackers using a variety of techniques, “including phishing, viruses and other attacks”, according to a post on Binance’s website by chief executive officer Zhao Changpeng.   The post said user funds would not be affected because the company would use its secure asset fund for users to cover the loss.   Bitcoin’s price dropped by as much as 4.2 percent in early Asian trading as news of the hack broke, although it later recovered some of its losses.   Zhao said on Twitter other crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, had blocked deposits from addresses linked to the hack.  Last year, $950 million of cryptocurrencies was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges and infrastructure services such as wallets, up nearly 260 percent from the previous year, research from U.S.-based cyber security firm CiptherTrace showed.

The Gaza-based Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which is proscribed by the United States and the European Union, has been calling on its supporters to donate using the digital currency in a fundraising campaign announced online in late January.  Originally, it asked donors to send bitcoin to a single digital address, or wallet.  However, according to research shared with Reuters by leading blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, in recent weeks it has changed the mechanism, with its website generating a new digital wallet with every transaction.  This makes it harder for companies around the world to keep tabs on the group’s cryptocurrency financing, the researchers said. A single digital wallet can be red-flagged to cryptocurrency exchanges, in theory allowing them to prevent funds moving through their systems to that destination.  But a different wallet for each donation makes this so-called tagging far more complicated, Elliptic said.  Between March 26 and April 16, 0.6 bitcoin - worth around $3,300 - was sent to the website-created wallets, Elliptic’s research found. All told, the four-month fundraising campaign has raised around $7,400, the firm said.  A spokesman for Hamas, which has ruled the Palestinian territory of Gaza since 2007, declined to comment on Elliptic’s research.  Such funds are a fraction of the tens of millions of dollars in annual funding that Israel and the United States says Hamas receives from Iran. Yet the campaign gives insight into how a proscribed group has gone about bitcoin fundraising.  “They are still in experimentation stage - trying it out, seeing how much they can raise, and whether it works,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson.  Iran has not publicly detailed its funding of Hamas, though it has not denied its support for the group. Hamas has said Tehran is the biggest backer of the al-Qassam Brigades.  London-based Elliptic and U.S. rival Chainalysis are the most prominent blockchain analysis firms, and have gained traction as watchdogs, cryptocurrency companies and firms such as hedge funds seek tools to track digital coins.  Backed by investors including Banco Santander’s venture capital arm, Elliptic’s clients include financial firms, regulators and law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States.   Since 2016 it has won contracts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service and Drug Enforcement Administration, according to USAspending.gov here, a database of U.S. government contracts.  Examples of cryptocurrency funding campaigns by proscribed groups are rare. But the research underscores headaches for companies in the emerging sector in identifying and stamping out exposure to potentially tainted digital coins, even as tools for tracking and tracing cryptocurrencies grow more sophisticated.     Dealing with illegal usage is seen as vital if cryptocurrencies are to grow from niche, speculative tokens to assets embraced by the mainstream. Most big financial firms have steered clear of bitcoin and its kin, with money laundering chief among concerns.  STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS  Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. Others, including Britain, have proscribed only the al-Qassam Brigades.  Such a designation means that, in the United States for instance, it is illegal to provide money or training, with financial firms in control of related funds obliged to report them to the authorities.  A two-minute video on the al-Qassam Brigades website lays out step-by-step instructions in Arabic on how supporters can avoid the traditional financial system and donate cryptocurrency.   “How to support the Palestinian resistance via Bitcoin?” it asks.   With polished graphics and English subtitles, it explains how to send bitcoin directly, through a money-exchange office, or via a cryptocurrency exchange. “Use a public device so that the wallet is not linked to your IP address,” it says.   Elliptic uses a database of information linking digital coin addresses to exchanges, darkweb marketplaces, and proscribed groups to track cryptocurrencies.   It pinpointed wallets created by the website by tracking patterns in their unique addresses. The firm monitored these addresses, later identifying multiple transactions that sent funds from the addresses to a major Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange.    Thirteen of the donations were made from a separate exchange, also from Asia, said Elliptic, which declined to give further details of the exchanges. It was not clear whether the bitcoin had since been converted to traditional currencies, the firm said.  Hamas’s finances are suffering. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi in 2013 closed hundreds of tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border, preventing the smuggling of weapons　and goods from cows to cars, depriving Hamas of tax income.  Funding from Iran has also declined following Hamas’s condemnation of the killing of Sunni Muslims in Syria’s civil war, analysts say.   Bitcoin could provide respite in that cash squeeze.   “It makes it difficult for such funds to be tracked by financial authorities,” said Lotem Finkelshtein, head of threat intelligence at Check Point Technologies, a cybersecurity firm in Tel Aviv.   “It’s not so simple to link wallets to organizations.”  Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency, defense ministry and military declined to comment.   Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who is also a member of the national security cabinet, told the website Ynet TV this month he was unaware of the fundraising.   Regulators and law enforcement agencies have long worried about the potential of digital money - relatively anonymous and easily available online - to finance terrorism.    Cryptocurrency regulations vary from country to country. The global watchdog for money laundering, aware of gaps in rules, is due to bring in the first international standards on cryptocurrency oversight by June.  But with regulation still patchy, the risk of exposure to tainted coins has kept most big investors away.  Even indirect exposure to tainted cryptocurrencies would present problems for financial firms, said Kyle Phillips, a lawyer at Fieldfisher law firm.  “There are real issues with establishing the beneficial owners,” he said.

The Gaza-based Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, which is proscribed by the United States and the European Union, has been calling on its supporters to donate using the digital currency in a fundraising campaign announced online in late January.  Originally, it asked donors to send bitcoin to a single digital address, or wallet.  However, according to research shared with Reuters by leading blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, in recent weeks it has changed the mechanism, with its website generating a new digital wallet with every transaction.  This makes it harder for companies around the world to keep tabs on the group’s cryptocurrency financing, the researchers said. A single digital wallet can be red-flagged to cryptocurrency exchanges, in theory allowing them to prevent funds moving through their systems to that destination.  But a different wallet for each donation makes this so-called tagging far more complicated, Elliptic said.  Between March 26 and April 16, 0.6 bitcoin - worth around $3,300 - was sent to the website-created wallets, Elliptic’s research found. All told, the four-month fundraising campaign has raised around $7,400, the firm said.  A spokesman for Hamas, which has ruled the Palestinian territory of Gaza since 2007, declined to comment on Elliptic’s research.

107,Oil and Bitcoin highlight growing risk of market crash - BAML,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1XR4SV,"November 16, 2018 11:51am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"The risk of a “flash crash” in markets is rising, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday, after a week in which previously-booming cryptocurrency Bitcoin tumbled, oil sank, and investors piled into stocks perceived as safer.  Rising volatility across a range of asset classes and rapid deleveraging like that seen in oil markets in recent weeks are signs a bear market could have further to go, they said.  Brent crude hit an eight-month low on Tuesday in its steepest one-day fall in more than three years and Bitcoin hit a 13-month low on Thursday, the latest assets to fall sharply.  “Sell rallies,” strategists at the U.S. bank advised clients, saying that despite sharp falls in the stock market, positioning by institutional investors was not pessimistic enough to signal the market could be at rock bottom.   “Ingredients of flash crash rising ... bond, FX, equity volatility all trending up, vicious deleveraging events, dislocation risk via abnormal spreads ... triggers could be violent U.S. dollar move and/or shock macro data forcing abrupt GDP and earnings downgrades,” they wrote.   The bear market has been such that cash has outperformed stocks and bonds this year for the first time since 1992, the strategists said, noting that despite this $122 billion has flowed into equities, $35 billion into money market funds, and $24 billion into bonds.  This week saw modest inflows of $4.6 billion into equities, while bonds suffered outflows of $5.2 billion, EPFR data showed.   Corporate bonds saw big outflows - investment grade corporate bond funds lost $2 billion and high-yield bond funds lost $2.3 billion.  Indeed, the next assets to drop could be high-yield credit and the U.S. dollar, BAML reckoned, which is up 5.1 percent year-to-date.   The “last bulls standing” are high-yield corporate bonds, the strategists wrote, and the U.S. dollar - which they see climbing further into the end of this year and first quarter of 2019 before falling.  In terms of regional flows, investors pulled $1.3 billion from European equity funds, which have seen outflows for 35 of the past 36 weeks.   U.S. equities, the world leaders in terms of performance and valuations, saw $2.6 billion of inflows.  A nascent appetite for emerging market stocks was visible,  with $1.2 billion going into the region, its fifth straight week of inflows.  GRAPHIC: Growth stocks begin to capitulate Nov 16 - tmsnrt.rs/2QIuNjT  Apple (AAPL.O), which BAML strategists labeled the “king of buybacks”, has cracked, they said, as the stock fell to below its 200-day moving average, a level seen as important for sentiment.   Apple shares are on course for their worst month since April 2016, and have suffered seven consecutive weeks of losses as the iPhone maker’s weak results and stress in the semiconductor space dented the stock.   Its recent decline signals share buybacks - which have been a key driver of the rapid rise of U.S. stocks - are no longer sufficient to fuel the market.  This year has seen a record $800 billion of U.S. buybacks so far, yet the S&P 500 buyback index - which tracks the performance of the 100 stocks in the index with the highest buyback ratios - is up just 0.9 percent year-to-date, and down 5.9 percent this quarter.  The recent decline of U.S. tech stocks like Apple which had led the market higher is one symptom of a building rotation from “growth” stocks into “value” stocks, further evidenced this week with $1 billion flowing into value-focused funds and $0.6 billion leaking out of growth-focused funds.   Defensive - steady revenue and high dividend yielding - sectors like healthcare and utilities also led the way in terms of inflows. Some $1.1 billion poured into healthcare funds and $700 million into utilities funds.   Financials funds, meanwhile, saw $1.2 billion of outflows.

108,Chinese bitcoin mining gear makers set sights on world's largest bitcoin IPOs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1IG0F2,"May 15, 2018 07:36am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers are set to test international investor appetite for cryptocurrencies with plans to raise as much as $1 billion each - in what are expected to be the world’s largest bitcoin-focused floats to date.  Canaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.  While the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines.  Both are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms.  Canaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.  Canaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also  expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.  Ebang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.  While many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.  In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX (DCC.AX) and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.   Another miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.   In Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain (HIVE.V) last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.  Canaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.   Credit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added.      Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.

110,"Police probe hoax bitcoin bomb threats across U.S., Canada",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1OD1KH,"December 14, 2018 04:57pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement officials on Friday were investigating a wave of hoax emailed bomb threats demanding bitcoin payment that caused worry but no damage in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  On Thursday in North America, hundreds of businesses, government offices and schools received awkwardly-worded letters threatening to set off explosives if payments of $20,000 in cryptocurrency were not received.   The threats led to scattered evacuations of schools and transit stations before the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies dismissed them as lacking credibility.  Hoax threats were received in cities including Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa and Calgary, Alberta.  Investigators do not yet know who was responsible, two federal officials said on Friday. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the recipients made ransom payments, one of the officials said.  Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) Talos cyber security unit said it believes the threats came from a group of fraudsters previously responsible for sending “sextortion” emails that claim to have videos showing the recipients having sex.  The fraudsters threaten to release compromising videos they claim to have obtained with software that recorded people through webcams on their computers.  Some of this week’s bomb threats came from the same internet addresses used in those sextortion campaigns, Talos researcher Jaeson Schultz said in a blog post.  “The criminals conducting these extortion email attacks have demonstrated that they are willing to concoct any threat and story imaginable that they believe would fool the recipient,” the blog said.   “We expect these sorts of attacks to continue as long as there are victims who will believe these threats to be credible, and be scared enough to send money to the attackers,” it said.   A similar series of hoax bomb threats occurred in December 2015, prompting officials in Los Angeles to close the city’s public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an over-reaction.  Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage.  A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers in dozens of U.S. states over several months.

They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.”  Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.

Initial jitters sparked by the wave of awkwardly worded messages, threatening to set off explosives unless $20,000 were delivered in bitcoin, subsided within hours as some local authorities began referring to the electronic extortion notes as a scam.   One email targeting a St. Louis-area middle school was traced by local investigators to an internet protocol, or IP, address in Moscow, the sheriff’s office in Lincoln County, Missouri said.  But U.S. government sources speaking on background to Reuters said that such findings were inconclusive and that federal investigators doubted that Russians or the Russian government were involved.  The officials cautioned that such an IP address does not prove it came from Russia because the sender could have electronically laid a false trail to cover up its true origin. They suggested instead that the flurry of emails were part of a wide-scale digital hoax.  The security scare began shortly before 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) as police departments in major U.S. cities coast to coast began reporting on Twitter that numerous local businesses had received the menacing emails.  Six hours into the security scare, no actual explosives had been found, authorities said. But the threats prompted brief evacuations of a Toronto subway station and a newspaper office in Raleigh, North Carolina. Some public schools and businesses also were evacuated as a precaution.  Lincoln County, Missouri, sheriff’s spokesman Lieutenant Andy Binder said authorities bused the students from a middle school receiving one of the threats to another campus as a precaution, but the school was later determined to be safe and classes will resume there on Friday.  Among other cities where bomb threats were reported by authorities were Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa, and Calgary, Alberta.  Several hours after North America was hit, similar email threats were showing up in New Zealand, according to police there.  Police at the University of Wisconsin in Madison tweeted an image taken of one email threat found to be circulating that said in part: “Good day. There is an explosive device (lead azide) in the building where your company is conducted. It is assembled according to my guide. It is compact and it is covered up very carefully. It can not damage the structure of the building, but in case of its explosion you will get many wounded people.”    The campus police tweet concludes by referring to the emails as “a SCAM happening nationwide.”         The FBI and other federal agencies were alerted to the email chains, officials said.  “We are aware of threats being made in cities across the country,” Rukelt Dalberis, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, told Reuters separately. “We remain in touch with our law enforcement partners. We encourage the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities that could represent a threat.”   A similar wave of emailed hoax bomb threats in December 2015 prompted officials in Los Angeles to close the city’s public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an overreaction.  Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage.  A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers in dozens of U.S. states over several months.

China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, even though such activities previously fell under a regulatory grey area.    The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Monday it was seeking public opinions on a revised list of industries it wants to encourage, restrict or eliminate. The list was first published in 2011.  The draft for a revised list added cryptocurrency mining, including that of bitcoin, to more than 450 activities the NDRC said should be phased out as they did not adhere to relevant laws and regulations, were unsafe, wasted resources or polluted the environment.  It did not stipulate a target date or plan for how to eliminate bitcoin mining, meaning that such activities should be phased out immediately, the document said. The public has until May 7 to comment on the draft.  State-owned newspaper Securities Times said on Tuesday the draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” toward the cryptocurrency industry.   “The NDRC’s move is in line overall with China’s desire to control different layers of the rapidly growing crypto industry, and does not yet signal a major shift in policy,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment firm Kenetic.   “I believe China simply wants to ‘reboot’ the crypto industry into one that they have oversight on, the same approach they took with the Internet.”  Other bitcoin traders said they were not surprised by the government’s move.      “Bitcoin mining wastes a lot of electricity,” said one Chinese bitcoin trader who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.   Last week, the price of bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of the 2017 bubble, and breaking $5,000 for the first time since mid-November, though analysts and traders admitted they were puzzled by the surge.   Bitcoin, which accounts for around half of the cryptocurrency market, was down by around 1.4 percent on Tuesday, while other major coins such as Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP also fell by similar amounts. Traders in London said it was unclear how much the Chinese move was weighing on the market.    The cryptocurrency sector has been under heavy scrutiny in China since 2017, when regulators started to ban initial coin offerings and shut local cryptocurrency trading exchanges.  China also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.  Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners that team up for economies of scale - are located in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said in December.  “Half of the network is probably located in China,” said Alex de Vries, a consultant with PwC in Amsterdam who specializes on blockchain and researches cryptocurrency mining. He added that the number of mining facilities in the world is still limited to several hundred.  Countries with relatively cheap electricity have emerged as major hosts of cryptocurrency mining. Mati Greenspan, an analyst with eToro in Israel, said any ban by China would cut a key supply of cheap electricity for the industry and raise the average cost to mine bitcoin.  Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, and last year three filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong, looking to raise billions of dollars.   However, the two largest, Bitmain Technologies, the world’s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining gear, and Canaan Inc, have since let their applications lapse.   People familiar with the deals said that Hong Kong regulators had many questions about the companies’ business models and prospects.  Bitmain declined to comment on the NDRC’s proposal to ban bitcoin mining. Canaan did not respond to requests for comment.   According to Canaan’s IPO prospectus filed last year, sales of blockchain hardware primarily for cryptocurrency mining in China were worth 8.7 billion yuan ($1.30 billion) in 2017, 45 percent of global sales by value.   The prospectus forecasts that sales in China would rise to 35.6 billion yuan by 2020.

Other smaller coins also skidded sharply as a broader cryptocurrency sell-off, said by traders and market makers to be rooted in heavy selling at leveraged Asian exchanges, gathered steam.  The fall followed a sudden plunge last week that shook bitcoin out of a period of relative stability, where prices had hovered around the $6,500 mark for several months.  Bitcoin sunk as far as $4,327, its lowest since October 2017. By mid-afternoon, it was trading around $4,750 on the Bitstamp exchange.   “We’d been waiting for a break-out,” said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro. “When you have the price moving so steadily you had lots of stop-loss orders building up - and now you are seeing them being liquidated.”   Ripple's XRP XRP=BTSP and Ethereum's ether ETH=BTSP, the second and third-largest coins, fell as much as 14 and 16 percent respectively before clawing back losses in U.S. trading hours.   Tuesday’s falls coincided with broader drops in financial markets. European shares fell as poor retail results and weakness in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) dragged down Wall Street.  Bitcoin has plummeted over 75 percent this year from a peak of $20,000 touched in December as retail investors piled into a one of the largest bubbles in history.  Traders and market makers blamed bitcoin’s slide on heavy selling at leveraged exchanges in Asia such as Hong Kong-based OKEx and Bitmex. Few exchanges in the West lend bitcoin to traders, making the Asian venues popular with speculators.  “The presence of leverage makes day traders attracted to Asian markets,” said Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading in New York, one of the biggest over-the-counter trading desks.   “Folks who are risking 100X type of leverage, it’s really difficult to think of that as an investment – it’s a casino mentality.”  Others blamed fears that last week’s “hard fork” in bitcoin cash, where a software upgrade split the fourth-biggest coin into two separate currencies, could destabilize others.  The price of bitcoin tends to be sensitive to debates over how its underlying network evolves. Last year the suspension of hard fork planned by major developers and investors proved a major catalyst to its breakneck rise.  Mainstream investors have stayed clear of bitcoin, with concerns over scant regulatory oversight and undeveloped market infrastructure compounded by frequent swings in price.   That lack of involvement has seen bitcoin struggle to live up to its billing as something that will revolutionize world finance. Its usage as a payment currency has shriveled this year.  At the same time, bitcoin’s plunge in value has calmed the fears of regulators and central bankers that it could one day pose a risk to financial stability.  According to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com, the total value of cryptocurrencies is now around $154 billion, down from a peak of around $800 billion in January.  Cryptocurrency advocates say bitcoin is still young and price volatility is to be expected. Many predict the need for virtual currencies that operate beyond mainstream banking will outlast any short-term price falls.     By late afternoon, XRP and ether were trading around $0.45 and $142 respectively on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.      “The euphoria has died and prices have consolidated with lower lows and lower highs,” said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at Forex.com. “A lot of people have lost interest.”  Reporting by Tom Wilson and Tommy Wilkes,; Editing by Saikat Chatterjee and Ed Osmond",-0.10189629629629629,0.014072827035789994

Goldman’s rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) had spoken in favor of the currency, with CEO James Gorman calling it “more than just a fad.”   The virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.

A fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.  Bitcoin was trading down nearly 4.8 percent at $7,007 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Wednesday.

127,Chinese bitcoin mining rig makers aim to raise billions in HK IPOs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1LC0EL,"August 27, 2018 10:25am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - (Reuters) Three of the world’s largest bitcoin mining equipment makers plan to raise billions of dollars with initial public offerings in Hong Kong, even as other companies report plunging demand for the chips needed to make bitcoin.   Soaring cryptocurrency prices last year triggered a boom in demand for specialist mining chips and in developing “mines” - facilities with thousands of machines that create the coins by solving complex mathematical puzzles.  Yet the US chipmaker Nvidia Corp said this month that second-quarter sales to crypto miners totalled just US$18m, compared with US$100m expected by analysts.  Nvidia’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said she anticipated “no contribution” to revenues from cryptocurrency in coming months.    That has raised concerns about the upcoming Hong Kong listings by three Chinese manufacturers of bitcoin mining equipment, Bitmain, Canaan Inc and Ebang International Holdings.   The companies all design high-end computer chips intended for mining cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, and sell mining equipment containing the chips. In addition, Bitmain mines cryptocurrencies on its own account. Companies like Nvidia also sell specialty chips used for mining.  “The marked decline in the price of bitcoin since the start of the year is likely to weigh on investors’ interest in these companies,” said Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates.  But, he added, “the fall in the price of bitcoin from its peaks has not been matched by an equivalent fall in the numbers of people mining it.”  Bitcoin is currently trading at US$6,699, down 64% from its December 2017 peak of US$18,690. Daily mining revenue was 77% lower than in December, according to Blockchain.info, a data analytics and wallet provider.  “As the bitcoin price decreases, so does the profitability of mining itself, which decreases demand for mining chips and miners,” said Wang Leilei, a consultant at financial services consultancy Kapronasia.  It is not just the price of bitcoin that is causing worries. People close to the IPOs said regulatory scrutiny and a patchy performance by Hong Kong offerings this year were additional concerns.  Julian Hosp, president of TenX, a Singapore-based blockchain firm, has also warned that if coins switch mining algorithms, then the machines designed to mine them would become useless.   “I would be quite wary of investing in these miners,” Hosp said, referring to the equipment makers. “They are not long-term businesses and I think they’ve had their uptrend for now.”  Canaan and Ebang filed plans in May and June respectively for floats in Hong Kong, while Bitmain is expected to file its plans next month for an IPO in which it aims to raise at least US$3bn, sources close to the deal said.  Cryptocurrency trading is a global activity, but Chinese chipmakers have led the way in developing the most efficient means to mine the coins.  Bitmain had three quarters of the market for the specialist chips last year, followed by Canaan on 14%, according to estimates by analysts at Bernstein.   Ebang is aiming to raise up to US$1bn, according to sources, while Canaan is targeting at least US$400m - down from a figure of up to US$2bn touted earlier this year by people involved in the deal.    While Ebang is expected to face Hong Kong’s listing committee in September, Canaan’s offering is taking longer.   Two sources familiar with Canaan’s situation said the company had not yet fixed a date for a committee appearance, as it worked on clearing up questions from HKEX officials regarding due diligence done on its prospectus.   A source close to Bitmain’S IPO said the company was aware about the potential for close regulatory scrutiny.  Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang didn’t respond to requests for comment. A Hong Kong exchange spokesman declined to comment.  The bitcoin price slump is leading miners to consider their IPO sales pitches carefully, with many involved expecting them to push the potential of other uses for their chips.  Both Canaan and Ebang highlight the potential for their technology to be applied to other cutting-edge sectors.   That includes broader development of blockchain applications - the ledger system that underpins bitcoin and which is being widely explored by the financial industry - as well as artificial intelligence tools and the forthcoming build-out of 5G telecoms networks both within and outside China.  “The mainland government encourages chip design and production, as that is a segment of China’s market that has been suffering,” said Kapronasia’s Wang.  “Bitmain and Canaan chips could also be used for non-bitcoin applications, like blockchain in general, big data, cybersecurity or AI, which is an advantage for the companies.”      Reporting by Julie Zhu, Alun John, Fiona Lau of IFR, Clare Jim, Marius Zaharia, Timothy Chan and Holly Chik in HONG KONG; Additional reporting by Thomas Wilson in TOKYO and Elias Glenn in BEIJING; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Philip McClellan",0.10191,-0.015223765432098767

Fed policymakers have been dismissive, particularly in recent months, of bitcoin’s promise as an alternative currency to the dollar or other central bank-backed money. San Francisco Fed President John Williams, who will next month move to New York to run the Fed there, has been particularly critical.  “One of the problems they have is the values are extremely volatile,” Williams said in April of cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular.  Trading in futures, which sometimes reduces volatility in the underlying asset, appeared this time to aid bitcoin’s fall.  The introduction of the contracts on CME, one week after a much thinner trade on began rival Chicago Board Options Exchange, gave bitcoin pessimists an easy way to bet on a drop in value. This is known as short-selling in the stock market but is an integral and unremarkable aspect of futures markets.  As trade in downside bets picked up on CME, the authors of the Fed paper wrote, that created a broader downcycle that affected the underlying “spot” bitcoin market as well, reducing order flow and putting downward pressure on the price.  “With falling prices, pessimists started to make money on their bets, fueling further short selling and further downward pressure on prices,” they wrote.

129,UPDATE 1-Hackers steal $41 million worth of bitcoin from Binance cryptocurrency exchange,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N22K1N7,"May 08, 2019 03:15am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hackers stole bitcoin worth $41 million from Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, the company said on Wednesday, the latest in a string of thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges around the world.   The 7,000 bitcoin were withdrawn by hackers using a variety of techniques, “including phishing, viruses and other attacks”, according to a post on Binance’s website by chief executive officer Zhao Changpeng.   The post said user funds would not be affected because the company would use its secure asset fund for users to cover the loss.   Advertisement Bitcoin’s price dropped by as much as 4.2 percent in early Asian trading as news of the hack broke, although it later recovered some of its losses.   Zhao said on Twitter other crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, had blocked deposits from addresses linked to the hack.  Last year, $950 million of cryptocurrencies was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges and infrastructure services such as wallets, up nearly 260 percent from the previous year, research from U.S.-based cyber security firm CiptherTrace showed.   Exchanges in Japan and South Korea accounted for 58 percent of the thefts last year, the research found.   Zhao’s post on the Binance website said that all deposits and withdrawals from the exchange would remain suspended while the company conducted a thorough security review, which, it estimated, would take a week.

On Thursday in North America, hundreds of businesses, government offices and schools received awkwardly-worded letters threatening to set off explosives if payments of $20,000 in cryptocurrency were not received.   The threats led to scattered evacuations of schools and transit stations before the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies dismissed them as lacking credibility.  Hoax threats were received in cities including Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa and Calgary, Alberta.  Investigators do not yet know who was responsible, two federal officials said on Friday. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the recipients made ransom payments, one of the officials said.  Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) Talos cyber security unit said it believes the threats came from a group of fraudsters previously responsible for sending “sextortion” emails that claim to have videos showing the recipients having sex.  The fraudsters threaten to release compromising videos they claim to have obtained with software that recorded people through webcams on their computers.  Some of this week’s bomb threats came from the same internet addresses used in those sextortion campaigns, Talos researcher Jaeson Schultz said in a blog post.  “The criminals conducting these extortion email attacks have demonstrated that they are willing to concoct any threat and story imaginable that they believe would fool the recipient,” the blog said.   “We expect these sorts of attacks to continue as long as there are victims who will believe these threats to be credible, and be scared enough to send money to the attackers,” it said.   A similar series of hoax bomb threats occurred in December 2015, prompting officials in Los Angeles to close the city’s public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an over-reaction.  Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage.  A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers in dozens of U.S. states over several months.

On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, bitcoin rose as much as 17 percent at one point in mid-morning European trading. By 1250 GMT, it was up 11 percent at $7,705, its highest level since March 29.  Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum .MVETH and Ripple .MVXRP also rose sharply, gaining more than 10 percent. EOS, another virtual currency, rose more than 30 percent, according to CoinMarketcap.com, which tracks the industry.  After rocketing to almost $20,000 in December, bitcoin’s price has fallen this year on the back of worries about a regulatory clampdown and concerns it is a speculative bubble that is now deflating.   That has prompted some traders to bet heavily against - to short - bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   After their prices stabilized in recent days and rose earlier on Thursday, those shorts were squeezed out of their positions, forcing the price upwards.  Two people active in the cryptocurrency market said the biggest moves in trading of bitcoin had occurred on the Bitfinex exchange before spreading to other platforms.  “People overshorting on Bitfinex so bit of a squeeze there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency analysis website CryptoCompare.

With the U.S. central bank likely to raise interest rates at least twice more this year and the European Central Bank unlikely to raise interest rates until the second half of 2019, traders remained cautious about the outlook of the euro.  “The broad theme remains one of dollar strength, and despite the recent consolidation in economic data, euro/dollar is trapped around these levels,” said Jane Foley, a senior G10 currency strategist at Rabobank in London.  Still, the euro rebounded from early lows after IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dipped slightly in July to 54.3. Anything above 50 indicates growth.  The euro was trading a fifth of a percent higher at $1.1712 after hitting an intraday low of $1.1654 in early London trading. It climbed to near a two-week high in the previous session at $1.1750.  Elsewhere, the Japanese yen trimmed most of its gains as expectations diminished about whether the Bank of Japan will launch a fresh round of stimulus at a scheduled policy meeting next week.  Japan’s central bank is debating changes to its interest-rate targets and stock-buying techniques, people familiar with the central bank’s thinking told Reuters, sending bond yields and the yen rocketing higher on Monday.  The yen was broadly flat against the dollar at 111.21 yen and a touch stronger against the euro and sterling.  Risk appetite was mostly firm after Beijing promised to pursue a more “vigorous” fiscal policy, stepping up efforts to support growth.  Both the euro and sterling edged higher against the Swiss franc as investors bet that further policy easing from China would send investors into higher-yielding assets.  However, expectations of more loosening drove the offshore yuan down half a percent to a 13-month low of 6.8448 yuan per dollar, its lowest since June 2017.  Bitcoin, the world’s best-known cryptocurrency, hit $8,000 on Tuesday on the Bitstamp exchange, its highest since May 23.  Recent reports about impending approval in the United States for a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund have helped bolster demand in recent sessions.  Bitcoin has lost more than half its value in 2018 as institutional and retail interest declined.

On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin fell as low as $6,853.53 in early afternoon trading in New York. That marked a fall of more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 hit in December.  Bitcoin has fallen in six of the last eight trading session.  The currency, which surged more than 1,300 percent last year, has lost about half its value so far in 2018, as more governments and banks signal their intention for a regulatory crackdown. Last week bitcoin suffered its worst weekly performance since 2013.  “We envisage this decline will continue, setting the next technical level at $5,000 a coin,” said Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, which specializes in foreign exchange, worldwide payments and treasury management.  Other cryptocurrencies also suffered double-digit declines on Monday, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com.  Ethereum, the second largest virtual currency, was last down nearly 19 percent at $703.40, while Ripple, the third largest, last traded at 71 cents, down 14.1 percent.  British bank Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) said on Sunday it was banning customers from using credit cards to buy bitcoin.

Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will give testimony to the Senate Banking Committee amid growing global unease about the risks virtual currencies pose to investors and the financial system.  The hearing follows a rout in the price of bitcoin, which plunged more than 15 percent to near a three-month low on Monday on concerns ranging from a global regulatory clampdown to a ban by some banks on using credit cards to buy bitcoin.  On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin fell as low as $6,853.53 in early afternoon trading in New York. That marked a fall of more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 in December. The currency surged more than 1,300 percent last year.  Lawmakers on Tuesday are set to probe Giancarlo and Clayton on the powers of the SEC and CFTC to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, how the watchdogs can protect investors from extreme volatility and fraud, and the risks posed by cyber criminals intent on stealing digital tokens.  Giancarlo and Clayton will use the hearing to showcase the efforts their agencies have made to police the market and to highlight limitations in the regulatory structure, according to their testimony published on Monday.  The sharp drop in bitcoin on Monday coincided with a broader sell-off in U.S. stock markets, which plummeted to their lowest levels in 2018.

159,COLUMN-How bitcoin IRA investments bypass U.S. fiduciary protections,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1QW15P,"March 15, 2018 07:05am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  By Mark Miller  CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bitcoin in an IRA? You might think holding a volatile, unregulated investment like cryptocurrency in a retirement account would violate the U.S. Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, which took effect last summer.  But despite the risks, the “bitcoin accepted here” shingle is hanging proudly in the Wild West of retirement investing - self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts.  Cryptocurrency is a digital - or virtual - currency that uses cryptography for security. Market-leader bitcoin racked up astonishing gains of more than 1,300 percent in 2017, but lost over half its value earlier this year. (reut.rs/2Fyp5jg). This week, it is trading around $9,000 - a stomach-churning drop from its 52-week high just short of $20,000 in December.  “As we’ve seen recently, it can drop like a stone, instantly,” said Ed Slott, who educates financial advisers on IRAs and publishes the Slott Report.   Traditional IRA accounts hold mutual funds, equities and bonds; the custodial firms that hold these accounts will not touch cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or other alternative investments, such as precious metals or real estate.     But in a self-directed IRA, you can invest in just about anything. Under the Internal Revenue Service Code, the only prohibited investments are life insurance, collectibles (such as coins or precious gems), or commingling personal assets (such as a home you own). A marketplace of small custodial firms specializes in these accounts.  IRA investments are the main focus of the fiduciary rule, because most of the assets in them are rolled over from 401(k) plans, which enjoy the protection of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. One of the main aims of the rule is to protect investors from high-cost, risky investments when they move assets to IRAs.  Self-directed IRAs are covered under the rule, although their proponents argued that they should have been exempted during the debate about its creation. “They tried to argue that if people wanted to gamble with their own money, we should let them,” said Phyllis Borzi, who led the fiduciary initiative as assistant secretary for Employee Benefits Security in the U.S. Department of Labor during the Obama administration.  “I wasn’t convinced by that argument, because self-directed IRAs are the least-regulated segment of the retirement account market.”  Self-directed IRA custodians are not acting as fiduciaries as long as they refrain from giving specific advice about investments. They can charge fees to facilitate fairly complex account setups; they also may provide education about the rules and regulations through books, pamphlets or videos.  A NON-FIDUCIARY ROLE     Consider Adam Bergman, author of “How to Use Retirement Funds to Purchase Cryptocurrencies in a Nutshell.” Bergman heads Miami-based IRA Financial Group, which acts as a custodian for self-directed IRAs. His company’s services are not limited to cryptocurrencies - most of the self-directed IRAs held at his firm are invested in real estate, he said.     Bergman, an attorney, is well aware of the rules against providing specific advice. “We are non-fiduciary custodians,” he said. “We don’t sell financial products - we take great pains to make sure we are not fiduciaries. We just facilitate. There’s no way on God’s green earth I’m going to give people investment advice.”  Fair enough. Yet on Bergman’s website, you can watch a video where he discusses clients who have had “huge gains” investing in cryptocurrency in the past few years - and paid no tax because they used Roth IRAs as the investment vehicle. “They may otherwise have three or four hundred grand in taxes they would have to come up with.”  But the worries do not end with taxes. Aside from their volatility, cryptocurrencies trade on unregulated online exchanges. Many have been plagued by technical problems and hacks, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission warned investors to be wary of fraudulent “pump and dump” schemes (reut.rs/2FyYxOP). The Wall Street Journal reported recently that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has issued dozens of subpoenas as part of a broad investigation of the cryptocurrency industry (reut.rs/2Ip2kft).  Self-directed IRAs are a small niche market, holding about $50 billion in assets, according to a report last year by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). By comparison, the overall IRA market represented $8.5 trillion at the end of the third quarter last year, according to the Investment Company Institute.  In its report, GAO focused on the additional responsibilities shouldered by investors in alternative assets, and recommended that the IRS improve the guidance offered to account owners on how to monitor their tax liability and determine fair market value of unconventional assets. The IRS agreed with the recommendations, but to date has only partially implemented the reforms, according to the GAO (bit.ly/2pbO150).     The appeal of using an IRA to invest in alternatives is simple. “For most people, it’s where their assets are concentrated,” said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Robert W. Baird & Co.  But Slott thinks retirement investors should consider the broader merits of alternative investments, and cryptocurrency in particular. “If a client asked me about this, I’d say - ‘Do you understand it? If you don’t know what you’re investing in, then why would you do it?’”  Sometimes that understanding is lacking. Said Steffen: “We even had one client who wanted to hold the physical coin itself.”  Editing by Matthew Lewis",0.14160697674418604,0.09215023994093761

The partnership means that large trading firms will have both bitcoin spot prices and bitcoin futures on the same screen, positioning them to potentially reap more profits trading the spread between the two financial products.   The firms withheld the financial terms of the deal.  Much of the interest in trading bitcoin has come from retail traders, but institutional participation has been picking up steam, especially over the past year, Adam White, general manager of Coinbase’s Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, said in an interview.    “This is the first time hundreds, if not thousands of institutional clients will have the ability to trade the crypto spot market side by side with 45 other markets,” he said.  Trading Technologies, known as TT, is connected to 45 markets worldwide, including CME Group (CME.O) and Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.O, which both introduced bitcoin futures trading in December.  The cash-settled futures give speculators a chance to short bitcoin, meaning they are betting the price of the underlying security will fall. One bitcoin was worth around $11,150 on Thursday morning, down from a high of around $19,000 last month.   TT also counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) , JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N), and most other Wall Street banks as clients, as well as many Chicago- and London-based proprietary trading firms.      “We’ve had a lot of demand from the institutional trading community, everything from the traditional buy-side, hedge funds, managed accounts, the prop community, that I think have been looking for a bridge like this as a way to trade the crypto markets against the cash markets,” Rick Lane, TT’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.     The Chicago-based firm will also be rolling out enhanced surveillance tools to help police crypto-trading in the coming months, Lane said.

168,Bitcoin skids amid broad cryptocurrency sell-off,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1FM11M,"February 02, 2018 04:42pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies plunged on Friday, with bitcoin at one point sliding below $8,000 and headed for its biggest weekly loss since December 2013, amid worries about a regulatory clampdown globally.  The currencies have come off their lows but analysts said the sell-off was probably not over.  This week’s slump brought the total market value of cryptocurrencies down to around $400 billion, half the high it reached in January, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com. The market value of cryptocurrencies is calculated by multiplying the number of digital coins in existence by their price, although many question whether that is the right way to value them.   Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, fell as much as 15 percent on Friday to a two-month low of $7,625 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BSP. It clawed back some losses and was down around 5.6 percent at $8,498 in late  New York trading.  The virtual currency is down by close to 25 percent this week and almost 40 percent in 2018. It surged more than 1,000 percent though in 2017.  For some market participants, bitcoin may be down, but it is not likely to fade.  “Bitcoin has become, and will continue to be, primarily a speculative asset class,” said David Moskowitz, Co-founder and Director of Indorse, the decentralized social network for professionals.   He added that the recent drops in transaction fees have made it easier to use bitcoin for payments once again. And if a payment solution can help the congestion, bitcoin may once again become an effective payment network, Moskowitz said.  The second and third largest virtual currencies, Ethereum and Ripple, also plunged more than 20 percent at the session low, Coinmarketcap.com said. Ethereum was last down 13.2 percent, at $888.22, while Ripple last traded at 83 U.S. cents, down 14.7 percent.  Retail investors have poured money into digital coins, enticed by the huge run-up in prices. Regulators say cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and dangerous investments.   On Thursday, India vowed to eradicate the use of crypto-assets, joining China and South Korea in promising to ban parts of the nascent market where prices have boomed in recent years.  Social media website Facebook (FB.O) said this week it would ban cryptocurrency advertisements because many were associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices. U.S. regulators have sent a subpoena to two of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency players, Bitfinex and Tether  A massive $530 million hack of a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange last week renewed worries about the security of the industry.  Critics of virtual currencies have called the run-up in prices a speculative bubble, but supporters of cryptocurrencies say short-term price volatility is to be expected, and the blockchain technology underpinning these assets maintains its power and value.   Going back to 2011 and including the current selloff, bitcoin’s price has been halved nine times on the Bitstamp exchange before recovering. The last time was from November 2014 to January 2015.

For those keeping score at home, the first round of this series was a resounding win for bitcoin bears over the bulls.  With the first contract expiring on Wednesday, the hedge funds and other speculative investors that took out bets that bitcoin was due for a pullback have likely made a handsome profit.  Meanwhile, the bulls who took the other side of that trade, mostly small investors, have largely seen their positions expire worthless courtesy of a massive selloff across the cryptocurrency complex since futures trading launched.  The cash-settled bitcoin futures allow investors and speculators to place bets on whether bitcoin will soar or slip, without holding bitcoin itself.  The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  On Wednesday, the official auction price for bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange was $10,900, compared with an auction price of $17,285.89, on Dec. 11, the first full day of Cboe bitcoin futures trading.  So far, speculative positioning on the Cboe bitcoin contracts has leaned to the short side. To be short a futures contract means traders believe the underlying security will fall in value.  Speculators’ net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,907 contracts in the week to Jan. 9, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.   The bulk of volume and open interest had been centered in the front month, suggesting much of that short position is likewise concentrated in January.

171,Trading Technologies-Coinbase deal to bridge bitcoin and futures,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1FE2CK,"January 25, 2018 10:59am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading software provider Trading Technologies International Inc said on Thursday it has teamed up with crypto-currency exchange operator Coinbase to give institutional traders direct market access to both bitcoin and bitcoin futures beginning in March.  The partnership means that large trading firms will have both bitcoin spot prices and bitcoin futures on the same screen, positioning them to potentially reap more profits trading the spread between the two financial products.   The firms withheld the financial terms of the deal.  Much of the interest in trading bitcoin has come from retail traders, but institutional participation has been picking up steam, especially over the past year, Adam White, general manager of Coinbase’s Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, said in an interview.    “This is the first time hundreds, if not thousands of institutional clients will have the ability to trade the crypto spot market side by side with 45 other markets,” he said.  Trading Technologies, known as TT, is connected to 45 markets worldwide, including CME Group (CME.O) and Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.O, which both introduced bitcoin futures trading in December.  The cash-settled futures give speculators a chance to short bitcoin, meaning they are betting the price of the underlying security will fall. One bitcoin was worth around $11,150 on Thursday morning, down from a high of around $19,000 last month.   TT also counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) , JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N), and most other Wall Street banks as clients, as well as many Chicago- and London-based proprietary trading firms.      “We’ve had a lot of demand from the institutional trading community, everything from the traditional buy-side, hedge funds, managed accounts, the prop community, that I think have been looking for a bridge like this as a way to trade the crypto markets against the cash markets,” Rick Lane, TT’s chief executive officer, said in an interview.     The Chicago-based firm will also be rolling out enhanced surveillance tools to help police crypto-trading in the coming months, Lane said.      Coinbase, which is regulated under the New York Department of Financial Services BitLicense, also said it would soon introduce a new custodian offering with strict financial controls and secure storage for institutional traders wanting to trade digital currencies like bitcoin.

174,Bubbly bitcoin not worth the wager: investors,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DH249,"November 17, 2017 12:20pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin may have surged a staggering 700 percent since the start of the year but most investors at a Reuters Summit this week said they had not been tempted to play the volatile cryptocurrency.  The difficulty of assigning a fair value to a speculative instrument that is less than a decade old and lacks the fundamentals that drive other asset classes was the main reason for steering clear of bitcoin, investors speaking at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit said.  Others said the cryptocurrency’s use for criminal purposes such as money laundering was another reason to stay away, as was the widespread perception that the bitcoin rally was another bubble destined to burst.  “Can you live without bitcoins? Yes. Could you live without tulips in the Netherlands? Yes,” Sankaran Naren, CIO of ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company, said at the Reuters Summit in Mumbai, referring to the tulip mania bubble in the Netherlands in the 17th century.  While a single bitcoin is worth nearly $8,000 BTC=BTSP, Japan Post Bank (7182.T) Chief Investment Officer Katsunori Sago said he believed its fair value was about $100 and it would have to fall to that level before the bank would consider buying it.  The idea that the bitcoin market, which is now worth $130 billion, constituted a bubble was the broad consensus among participants at the investment summit, which took place in London, Mumbai, New York, Singapore and Tokyo.  Bitcoin was created in 2008 as a Web-based cryptocurrency to move money around quickly and anonymously but the market is not yet regulated by any mainstream financial institution.  While scores of digital currency hedge funds have been launched this year, institutional investors worry that bitcoin is too lightly regulated, too volatile and too illiquid to risk investing other people’s money in.  The difficulty in having an idea what bitcoin’s value should be also means that institutional investors are not just staying away from buying the currency, but also staying away from selling, or “shorting”, it.  “Bubbles can go on for much longer, and get much bigger, than anybody ever predicted before they start, and therefore when you’re shorting something you need to be very very careful,” Peter Fitzgerald, head of multi-assets at Aviva Investors, told the Reuters Summit in London.  Even the imminent launch of bitcoin futures by the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group Inc (CME.O), would not be enough to entice most mainstream investors. But it would draw in some.   Major British hedge fund firm Man Group (EMG.L) said it would add cryptocurrencies to its investment universe if the CME bitcoin future is launched in December, as planned.   CME Group said last month it would launch a futures contract for bitcoin later this year in response to increasing interest from clients.  Laurence Fink, CEO and founder of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N), said he wondered why bitcoin got so much media attention, particularly given its use in money laundering.       “I don’t think about bitcoin; it’s just not even on my mind,” Fink told the Reuters Summit, though he allowed that while it’s a tiny product, “it’s fun to watch”.       Still, many investors at the summit said while they were shunning bitcoin and the hundreds of other cryptocurrencies launched in recent years, they were interested in investing in the technology known as blockchain that underpins them.  BlackRock’s Fink said blockchain did have a legitimate future, even if its widespread use was some way off.  Blockchain works as a tamper-proof shared database network that updates itself in real-time, automatically processing and settling transactions using computer algorithms with no need for third-party verification.   Banks and other financial firms are investing heavily in the technology, believing it could reduce costs and make their operations faster and more efficient.  “I travel a lot and I meet a lot of clients. Very rarely do I get asked about bitcoin - I don’t know where that excitement exactly resides,” Joachim Fels, global economic advisor and a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), which has about $1.69 trillion in assets under management, told the summit in New York.   “But we spend a lot of time internally to look at what’s behind this, to look at the ... implications of blockchain for the way how transactions are recorded and what it means in terms of potential for disruption in the financial sector,” he said.  Many summit participants said interest in cryptocurrencies in the mainstream investment universe was limited to high-net worth individuals and companies managing portfolios for individual wealthy families.  But Mike Novogratz, former star macro hedge fund manager at Fortree Investment Group and now CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, said institutional investors were only about six to eight months away from adopting bitcoin.  “The institutionalisation of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said at the summit in New York.

The remaining 2,000 bitcoins went to venture capitalist Tim Draper, the venture capitalist said last Friday in an emailed statement to Reuters. Donahue declined to confirm this.  Draper said he successfully bid on one lot on behalf of Draper Associates.  Draper also declined to disclose the price he paid.  The move helps fulfill his plan to invest 300 bitcoins in every business that participates in Boost, a program for bitcoin-related startups founded by his son, Adam Draper.  Last week’s second auction of bitcoins by the U.S. Marshals showed a drastic decline in bidders from the first sale in June. The first auction attracted 45 bidders, with 63 bids, while the December sale showed just 11 buyers and 27 bids, according to the Marshals Service office.  Bitcoin on Tuesday was down 2 percent at $352.24. It rose to a high of more than $1,000 in December last year, but  has lost more than 50 percent of its value so far in 2014.  The digital currency’s volatility, a consequence of its decentralized nature and its small trading volume, has been a major obstacle to its growth.  “A lot of people are underwater in their bitcoin positions this year,” said George Samman, chief operating officer, at BTC.sx, a bitcoin derivatives trading platform.  “The bitcoin story is not as hot as it used to be. The whole ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds and bitcoin is being accepted more widely, but the price keeps going down. To consumers in general, price matters.”   (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Nate Raymond and Sarah McBride in San Francisco; Editing by Christian Plumb)",0.1757047619047619,0.09623316498316499

Dimon, known for his candid comments, slammed the viability of bitcoin in September. “The currency isn’t going to work. You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” he had said at a conference.  The buzz generated by Dimon’s comments spurred more interest in the alt-currency. Bitcoin rose around 30 percent in one month following Dimon’s speech, where he also compared the currency to tulips bulbs in a reference to the famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Dimon's comments were followed by a more tempered view from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who said the bank was ""very open minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated."" (reut.rs/2mies8H)  Despite Dimon’s criticism, several banks, exchange operators and companies eagerly embraced bitcoin, sparking a spectacular rise in the ctyptocurrency.  On Tuesday, bitcoin was down nearly 5 percent at $14,202 in early trading. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.  Exchange operators such as CME Group Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading, while Square Inc rolled out a bitcoin buying/selling feature on its app to a select few. (reut.rs/2AHz1Q1) (reut.rs/2AK55Tq)  Dimon and Lake, however, have commended blockchain - the technology used by bitcoin and other digital currencies - a view echoed by Citigroup Inc CFO John Gerspach and many others across the industry.

Reuters is unable to verify the Yonhap report.  “While the threat of heavy regulation, or even a total ban on exchange trading, has hovered over bitcoin in recent weeks, reports this morning that the South Korean government are softening their stance have given traders confidence to buy,” said Dennis de Jong, managing director, at online brokerage UFX.com in Limassol, Cyprus.  South Korea has been pushing for broad regulatory supervision of cryptocurrency trading as locals, including students and housewives, have entered the market despite inherent risks and warnings from policymakers around the world of a bubble.

Officials later clarified an outright ban is only one of the steps being considered, and a final decision was yet to be made.

Bitcoin’s slide triggered a selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day at one point, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next biggest, Ripple, plunging by as much as a third.  Bitcoin traded as low as $11,191.59 (£8,127) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  In New York trading, it edged up to $12,078, but that was still down 11.2 percent, leaving it on track for its biggest one-day fall since September.   “With reports on a renewed crackdown on the cryptocurrency in China fuelling anxiety over future restrictions, further losses could be on the cards (for bitcoin) in the near term,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM in the UK.  “The sharp depreciation witnessed in bitcoin today should remind investors on how explosively volatile and unpredictable the cryptocurrency can be,” he added.   South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.  South Korea said on Monday its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalised, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market.  That came amid news that a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies and prohibit individuals and businesses from providing related services.  China shut down exchanges operating on the mainland last year - a move that also sparked a selloff, though the market later recovered.   “It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting (bitcoin), with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.  “But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,” he said.  Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum.   The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down around 40 percent from a record high near $20,000 hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its total market value - the unit price multiplied by the number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.  “From a technical standpoint, bitcoin is under pressure on the daily charts,” said Otunuga. “The breakdown below $12,000 may encourage a further decline towards $11,000 and $10,000, respectively.”  A director at Germany’s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community.

197,Insurers gingerly test bitcoin business with heist policies,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-insurance-insight/insurers-gingerly-test-bitcoin-business-with-heist-policies-idUSKBN1FL406,"February 01, 2018 07:23am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major global insurers are starting to offer protection against cryptocurrency theft, willing to tackle daunting challenges it brings rather than miss out on this volatile and loosely regulated, but rapidly growing business.  So far only a few insurers sell such insurance, including XL Catlin, Chubb, and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance . Yet several others told Reuters they are looking into theft coverage for companies that handle digital currencies like bitcoin and ether, which trade between anonymous parties.  Such efforts so far have garnered little attention, but the emergence of an insurance market marks an important step for the nascent industry’s mainstream recognition.  The risks are clear: digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks, technical errors and fraud. Many hacked exchanges later shuttered.  On Friday, Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck became the latest casualty, reporting a loss of around $534 million worth of coins to hackers.  For insurers the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about, who use technology few understand and represent a young industry that lacks troves of data insurers usually rely on in designing and pricing coverage.  Christopher Liu, who heads American International Group Inc’s North American cyber insurance practice for financial institutions, said the answer is to find an established business with a similar risk profile and try to adapt what works there.  “It’s sort of akin to a digital armored car service,” he said about cryptocurrency firms. “If there is a problem – like an accident or a robbery - that’s going to be the accumulation of all these exposures.” Liu says AIG began researching cryptocurrency theft coverage in 2014 and has written a few such policies, but remains in an “exploratory phase.”  Greg Bangs, head of XL Catlin’s North America crime coverage underwriting recounts how the firm had to become its own expert on the new technology by talking to key players and potential clients before developing bitcoin theft insurance.  “The first challenge for us was to figure out if there was a product here.” XL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to $25 million per incident, Bangs said.  Knowing the customer also takes on special importance.  Jackie Quintal, who advises financial institutions for insurance broker Aon Plc, said part of her job is to tell legitimate digital currency companies from shady ones, something that often gets cleared up even before an insurer gets involved.  “If someone is hesitant to provide information and they don’t have answers to compliance questions, they tend to disappear on their own,” she said.  Still, insurers spend more time than usual scrutinizing everything from security and storage procedures, the scale of their operations, to the people involved - a process that can take several months.  “Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets weren’t anticipating the level of underwriting and due diligence that they undergo when they approach the market,” said Matt Prevost, who heads Chubb’s North American Cyber Product Line.  Insurers like Chubb are betting that cryptocurrencies will gain wider recognition even if the new business now represents only a tiny sliver of the global $720 billion per year commercial insurance business.  Digital coin sales raised more than $5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights. There are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected.   COOL ON “HOT STORAGE”  Many insurers remain wary of the new business. Some, like Great American Insurance Group, an American Financial Group Inc unit, offer protection from employee theft to companies that accept bitcoin payments, but avoid outside risks, such as hacking. The company added the coverage to its standard employee theft policy in 2014.  Others will avoid coverage for coins kept online, or in ""hot storage,"" because of high risk of hacking and will only cover offline “cold storage,” which is also generally preferred by cryptocurrency companies. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2DNRkFu)  Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange available in 32 countries, says on its website it holds less than 2 percent of customer funds online and that those funds are insured.  Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance marketplace, was providing insurance to the exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not determine the terms or the scope of the coverage and a Lloyd’s spokesman declined to discuss Coinbase.  He said that member companies have written a small number of policies for cryptocurrencies in recent years and Lloyd’s was requiring members to proceed with caution and use additional scrutiny of cryptocurrency companies.  Some insurers are not yet convinced the cryptocurrency business is large enough for premiums to cover possible losses.  “We’re looking at it, but does it make sense to offer a market for that?” said Frank Scheckton, President of Great American’s Fidelity Crime Division.  Right now, costs act as a deterrent for small firms and startups, said Ty Sagalow, chief executive of Innovation Insurance Group LLC, which has been developing coverage for cryptocurrency companies since 2013.  “It’s an expensive product that many companies can’t afford,” he said.  Annual premiums for $10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about $200,000, or 2 percent of the limit, insurance experts say. That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients, depending on the company, loss history and other factors.  Currency volatility is another concern. While coverage limits shield insurers from wild swings, the impact for clients can be dramatic. For example, a $10 million policy signed in January 2017 would cover 10,957 bitcoins at the time, but only 923 if a hack happened a year later.  Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, argues insurance should not be an investor’s primary concern.  As a registered New York trust company, Gemini carries state-mandated insurance against employee theft, computer fraud, and fund transfer fraud, but has no coverage for hacking, Winklevoss, who founded the firm with his twin brother Tyler, said.  “The key is to look for regulatory oversight that ensures that an exchange is doing what it should be doing so that it doesn’t get to the point where you have to fall back on an insurance policy,” he told Reuters.  However, Henry Sanderson, who oversees cyber and technology coverage for Safeonline LLP, a Lloyd’s broker, argues cryptocurrency insurance can help the young industry mature while creating new business for insurers.  This whole space is maturing and growing,” he said. “If we don’t embrace it now, it’s a missed opportunity for insurers.”   (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London, Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Anna Irrera in New York; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",-0.034234883720930226,0.08437246668060622

Silbert said the new exchange will be modeled after the New York Stock Exchange, and would be launched possibly in the summer of 2014.

Involving the big banks is crucial in advancing the bitcoin market, Silbert said, which he said would, “probably provide the level of comfort that institutional investors are looking for.”  The exchange will be part of a new company that SecondMarket will spin off to oversee all the firm’s bitcoin activities. A subsidiary of SecondMarket sponsors the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which has net assets of $47 million and a trading desk.  The plan to launch a new exchange comes as Mt.

200,Road to bitcoin ETF paved with red tape,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EY2OE,"January 09, 2018 05:09pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The going is getting tough for U.S. companies hoping to win the race to bring a bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market.  Bitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the red-hot asset. A host of companies are jostling to launch exchange-traded funds which would open up the cryptocurrency to a broad retail market.  But regulators are asking tough questions, and five fund managers this week shelved plans to launch ETFs based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.  “We can expect the SEC to be increasingly watchful over any companies involved in bitcoin activity,” said Marc Butler, a director at compliance management firm Intelligize. “Investors should be warned. If it’s too good to be true, then it probably is.”  The SEC has pending applications for at least 14 different bitcoin ETFs or related products, regulatory filings show.  A handful of funds have been knocked back. The SEC in March denied a request to list an ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, owners of the Gemini bitcoin exchange.  The Winklevoss fund is seeking to invest in bitcoin directly. Other fund firms staked their hopes on recently launched U.S.-listed bitcoin futures contracts, which promised a more stable base for ETFs than the largely unregulated virtual currency spot market.   But on Monday, Rafferty Asset Management LLC, which manages the Direxion brand and hopes to list leveraged funds that would double bitcoin’s daily price moves, disclosed that the SEC was concerned about the “liquidity and valuation” of bitcoin futures contracts. It said the regulator told it to withdraw its application until it could address those issues.   On Tuesday, ProShare Capital Management LLC, Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP said in filings that SEC staff asked them to shelve plans for bitcoin ETFs.  Direxion, ProShares, VanEck and the SEC declined to comment. First Trust did not immediately respond to an email.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was last down 1.5 percent at $14,779 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   The race to launch bitcoin funds is still likely to charge forward, analysts said, as fund managers rush to address the SEC’s concerns and redesign their funds to placate the regulator.   “This is being driven by retail demand,” said Axel Merk, founder and chief investment officer of Merk Investments, which launched a physically backed gold ETF in 2014. “If people are enthusiastic about bitcoin, then people are going to try to market a bitcoin ETF.”   Merk said he knows of several funds that have examined the criticisms of the past filings and are determined to push through with their bitcoin ETF launches.  Some are also attempting indirect approaches that could provide bitcoin exposure via more traditional assets.   Five fund managers, for instance, have filed proposals for funds that would invest primarily in stocks with exposure to bitcoin or blockchain, the technology used to record bitcoin transactions.  Thorny questions remain for funds that seek to trade in bitcoin futures, including the level of margin required to trade futures and the potential for bitcoin futures to trade at dramatically different prices than the cryptocurrency itself, according to two people who did not want to be identified revealing discussions they had with the SEC.  Regulatory concerns did not stop the market from opening up by way of futures, though scrutiny of digital currency contracts now appears to be ramping up.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last month allowed CME Group Inc (CME.O) and CBOE Global Markets Inc CBOE.O to list bitcoin futures contracts, but recently sought to review its process for listing digital currency futures.  Still, some think that, head-spinning volatility of bitcoin aside, U.S. capital markets risk missing out on a burgeoning technology if they are too cautious.  “If the SEC doesn’t start allowing products, the capital markets here in the United States will get left behind by those in Europe and Asia. That’s always a concern,” said Trace Schmeltz, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg in Chicago.

202,Stakes are high in hunt for bitcoin's 'messiah',https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0TS1FQ20151209,"December 09, 2015 11:03am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The stakes are high in the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or people behind bitcoin, not just for the journalist who gets it right first, but also for the cryptocurrency itself.         An Australian entrepreneur and academic, Craig Steven Wright, is the latest candidate, outed in articles by Wired magazine and technology news website Gizmodo hours before his home and office in Sydney were searched by police.  Both articles said investigations based on leaked emails, documents and web archives pointed strongly to Wright being “Nakamoto”. “Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he’s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did,” said Wired.  But the search has already tripped up several journalists, most famously Newsweek’s Leah McGrath Goodman, who identified Japanese American Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2014 as bitcoin’s creator.   Dorian Nakamoto denied it - as has nearly everyone else alleged to be the mastermind credited with writing the paper, protocol and software in 2008 that gave rise to bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.    Unmasking the “real” Nakamoto would be significant both for the future development of bitcoin and, potentially, the currency’s market value.  While any changes to the bitcoin protocol can only be implemented by consensus, the proven founder of the cryptocurrency could hold considerable sway.  “Decision-making power doesn’t rest with any individual, but Nakamoto is such a mythical figure, if he appears he could become a sort of messiah to the community,” said Roberto Capodieci, a Singapore-based entrepreneur focusing on the blockchain.  Persuading that community is not easy: while the system is decentralised by design, a cluster of so-called bitcoin miners based in China are key, Antony Lewis, a Singapore-based bitcoin consultant, said.  Unlike traditional currency, bitcoins are not distributed by a central bank or backed by physical assets such as gold, but are “mined” using computers to calculate increasingly complex algorithmic formulas.     Miners run pools of computers that process transactions and create new bitcoins, an energy intensive business that has frozen out all but a handful of players.   The group effectively scuttled a recent effort by one key bitcoin thinker to make processing simpler and cheaper, Lewis said.   David Moskowitz, Singapore-based founder of start-up bitcoin brokerage Coin Republic, said knowing who Nakamoto was would be significant “because people are looking for a core voice behind (bitcoin). It would help us understand what Satoshi thought”.  Then there’s the fact that bitcoin researchers believe he or she may be holding up to 1 million bitcoins, which if sold today would fetch $414 million.  If Nakamoto chose to sell out, or even hinted that he might, that would push the price down, reducing the incentive to mine which might in turn provoke a steeper fall in the currency, Lewis said.   On the other hand, Nakamoto could help reduce uncertainty by reassuring bitcoin users he was not going to sell his holdings in one go or, more drastically, do something called “burning” — publicly deleting the coin by sending them to a bitcoin address to which he or she did not have the key.  “It would be like throwing the money into the bottom of the sea, and reduces the uncertainty of dumping onto the market,” said Lewis.  Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful.  Fellow tenants at the north Sydney office building listed as the address of one of his companies described him as “an outgoing guy”, who they nicknamed “Mr Bitcoin” because he had once offered to pay for some work in the currency.  And even if Wright did admit to being Nakamoto, he would still have to prove it.  That could be done by announcing he would move some of the bitcoin believed to belong to him, and then doing so, or signing a message with one of the encryption keys used in emails known to have been written by Nakamoto when bitcoin first appeared.  Wright has not been a prominent member of the bitcoin community, but he has appeared at several gatherings in the past year or two.   Moskowitz, who met him at a Singapore conference last year, said he was interesting and pleasant to talk to. “He’s clearly very intelligent and fits the profile,” he said. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean he is Nakamoto.”  Hints as to Wright’s own feelings on unmasking Nakamoto can be found on Quora, a website where users answer questions posed by other users and vote for the best answer.   In September someone with his name, position and profile picture “upvoted” another Quora user’s comment that “as a currency that is meant to be ‘for the people, by the people’, it is probably smart that no one knows who exactly started this coin. It is perfect that Satoshi Nakamoto founded it and vanished.”  (Adds full name of start-up in paragraph 13 and corrects date (to ‘last’ year from ‘this’ year) in paragraph 23.)

Other central banks faced the same problem.  “The Bank of Israel’s position is that they should be viewed as a financial asset,” Baudot-Trajtenberg told a meeting of Israel’s parliamentary finance committee, noting that there was no government responsibility for investors in bitcoin.  The central bank, Baudot-Trajtenberg said, was studying the issue of virtual currency but not much could be learned from what exists globally since no regulator anywhere in the world had issued guidelines to the banking system on how to act in relation to customers’ activity in virtual currencies.  “There is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity,” she said. “Beyond the risks to the customer there are also compliance risks to the bank.”  The value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading on Monday around $15,370.  Bitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital “coins”, which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country’s central bank. It is “mined” by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas.   Several other cryptocurrencies have been launched that work on similar principles.  Committee members during the meeting on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies urged Israel’s regulators to quickly come up with regulations.  “There seems to be a greater possibility that they will become central to our financial lives,” said Moshe Gafni, the chairman of the panel.   He called on regulators to submit to the committee within a month how they tend to deal with bitcoin and the like.  Still, Israel’s regulators are generally opposed to giving credence to virtual currencies since they are based on private initiatives and they do not have the same level of investor confidence as regular currencies.  “The anonymous nature of virtual currencies leads to the possibility that they may be used to launder money, finance crime, and so forth,” Baudot-Trajenberg said.  Shlomit Wagman, head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering authority said a thorough investigation was needed since terrorist organisations use virtual currency platforms.  Last week, Israel’s markets regulator proposed regulations that would ban from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange companies whose main business revolves around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

206,Bitcoin catches on in tech-savvy Romania,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0FX0VQ20140728,"July 28, 2014 07:09am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - In a well-lit office with red window frames in downtown Bucharest, Romania’s first bitcoin ATM attracts many who until it opened in May had to buy or sell the digital currency face-to-face or through wire transfers.  The interest in bitcoin in Romania stands out in a region where national currencies are widely seen as poor substitutes for the euro.   Tech-savvy and still deeply distrustful of officialdom 25 years after the end of communism, many Romanians are unfazed by warnings about the cryptocurrency.  In the western town of Oradea, 370 miles (595 km) away from the capital, the first bitcoin exchange in the country has drawn more than 2,000 clients in the seven months since it opened, with transactions totaling 5.12 million lei ($1.57 million).   But Romania ranks as the European Union’s second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin.  Bitcoin is still an infant in Europe relative to the United States, where hundreds of start-ups backed by some Wall Street traders and venture capitalists have propelled consumer and media interest. Activity in virtual currencies around Europe is concentrated in London, Amsterdam and Berlin.   Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility.  “It is an industry in its early stages,” said George Rotariu, who opened the ATM in Bucharest in collaboration with Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and plans to expand to more Romanian cities. “You need a legislative framework to supply services or have a business in this field,” he said.   “We groped around in the legislation and interpreted some policies,” said Horea Vuscan, a local politician who owns the Oradea bitcoin operator BTCXchange.  “We are now in talks with officials because I don’t know where we fit in, a bourse, bank, money transfer firm.”  Bitcoin is stored entirely on computers, not backed by any government or central bank. It lets owners hold, trade and move money from place to place almost as cheaply as sending email.  Its use has raised concerns for governments around the world, especially after Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world’s leading bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after saying some 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing.  A report by Bank of America last year found bitcoin showed promise as a low-cost way to do e-commerce and as an alternative to traditional money transfer services, but could also be used to evade high taxes, capital controls and confiscation.    In July, the European Banking Authority, the EU’s banking watchdog, urged national policymakers to discourage credit and payment institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies pending a regulatory framework.  “Using bitcoin in Romania is not regulated and carries very large risks,” said the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority (ASF). “The risk of fraud is also not to be ruled out.”  It said the industry “would need to have a visible economic significance in Romania, which it does not”, before regulation is considered, adding it would enforce any EU-approved rules.  Some EU states, including Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany or Poland have found ways to tax bitcoin transactions.  But Romania collects just under 60 percent of its regular tax goal. That amounts to roughly 33 percent of economic output, well below the bloc’s 46 percent average.  “There is some preoccupation with bitcoin,” one finance ministry official said. “But a legal framework is some time away and only after that will we analyze the need for a fiscal one.”  The number of Romanian service providers accepting bitcoins - which are divisible to eight decimal places - has risen slowly to a handful of coffeeshops, gyms, restaurants and beauty salons, according to service tracker coinmap.org.  “I want to bring bitcoin to street level, I want everyone to have a phone app where they keep their coins and use it everywhere, in coffee shops, restaurants, grocery shops, just like a regular wallet,” BTCXchange owner Vuscan said.       But before it can gain greater traction, bitcoin needs to address its volatility; it has swung from 1,170 lei ($370) to 3,406 lei ($1,100) this year, according to Oradea’s BTCXchange.  Vuscan’s exchange works only for Romanian leu deals, but he plans to open it to euro and dollar transactions, hoping to join larger European bitcoin exchanges such as Slovenia’s Bitstamp.  BTCXchange is registered as a standard company. Vuscan enforced some safeguards - users are required to have a bank account and there are self-imposed policies against money laundering. But there are no legal or regulatory safeguards.  Bitcoin’s rise in Romania is partially due to its status as one of Europe’s active technology hubs. The country has attracted investors including Oracle, IBM and Intel.  But while Romania boasts pockets of super-fast internet networks, only 58 percent of households have internet access, below the EU average. A 2012 Verizon report also said Romania was the world’s second-biggest hacking center after China.  Vuscan says his exchange is safe and he will reimburse clients if their bitcoins get stolen. “I can hardly wait for them to try,” he said when asked about hacker attacks.        ($1 = 3.2626 Romanian lei)  Editing by Eric Auchard and Ruth Pitchford",0.12381666666666666,0.0440079365079365
207,Are Bitcoin buyers enthusiasts or savvy speculators?,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE95P0LP20130626,"June 26, 2013 08:10am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pat Chen made a Bitcoin the other day. But he didn’t mine it the way you are supposed to by following a set of instructions using a specialized algorithm to create the digital currency, then waiting to snag one of the 21 million Bitcoins that will be generated by the year 2140.  Developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym, each Bitcoin gets a serial number and ownership is transferred between online accounts called wallets. They can be traded via online markets and accepted for payment by merchants.  Instead, Chen ginned one up on his 3-D printer. It is a bright yellow, grooved disc with a raised B on one side.  “It’s just a toy,” he says, showing it off at the regular Thursday night Bitcoin Meetup in New York City.  Chen only owns one “real” Bitcoin, but he’s interested in accepting the currency at his tech shop, xCubicle, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and in disruptive technologies in general. Chen once speculated in Iraqi currency because he thought it would go up in value as the country rebuilt, like the German currency after World War II. But that did not happen.  “Bitcoin is like the lottery. It’s a gamble,” Chen says.  What Bitcoin is intended to be, however, is a currency - a virtual currency that exists independently of any government.  Bitcoins are “mined” by software running a set of algorithms and their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system’s control over the minting of money. There are just over 11 million Bitcoins in circulation now, currently worth an estimated $1.2 billion.  And while some people insist it’s just a fad, Bitcoin enthusiasts say it is the future. But with extreme volatility in the price of Bitcoins since the start of 2013 - they went from $13 in January to a peak of $266 in April to around $100 today - the outlook is hazy, even as trading gets more popular.  Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin wallet accounts have grown to over 300,000 from 50,000, according to blockchain.info, which collects Bitcoin data.  Security is an issue, though. Two high-profile thefts, from Bitcoin Savings and Trust and Instawallet, amounted to more than $10 million in estimated losses. And seizures of virtual currency accounts, plus the shutdown of some exchanges by U.S. authorities on money laundering allegations adds regulatory uncertainty to the mix.  At the Meetup, Chen is joined by about 40 others in his demographic - mostly male, tech-savvy, under 40 - looking to build the kind of ancillary businesses that will serve the Bitcoin market. Some are building trading websites, others are working on information sites and some are working on charity initiatives.  Pierre Roshard, 23, just graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and is on his way to a job at Deloitte & Touche LLP in the fall. He has no 401(k), no Roth, no other investments, but he has some Bitcoins. He’s building a website, bitcoinadvisory.com, full of information on topics such as tax implications and custody issues for financial professionals handling Bitcoins.  “I would hesitate to even use the word investment,” Roshard says. “It’s how I motivate myself. It’s like having stock options in the company that you work for.”  New York City-based investment advisor Josh Brown, who is known on the Web as The Reformed Broker, keeps an annual list of the top investing fads and themes that have petered out. The list for 2012 included homebuilding stocks and the market’s obsession with Apple. Contenders for 2013 are country specific exchange-traded funds, especially Japan, and new dividend equity funds.  Bitcoin is unlikely to make his list because he does not think it even rates as a fad yet.  “It’s too sophisticated for the masses,” Brown says. “The thing that will strangle it is that every large tech company is working on currency to be used in its own eco-system.”  For Bitcoin enthusiasts, it is more about being part of a movement and potentially having that get-rich-quick moment that will catapult them past entry-level jobs.  “It’s like Columbus discovering the New World,” says Philip Nemirovsky, who travels from Philadelphia to New York each week to meet with others interested in Bitcoin. “It’s a paradigm shift, like Napster.”  When it is pointed out that Napster did not have a long, successful history, Nemirovsky shoots back: “Napster might be dead, but Sean Parker is still rich.”  Follow us @ReutersMoney or here.

It added that Russian law stipulates that the rouble  is the sole official currency and that introducing any other monetary units or substitutes was illegal.  Russia’s central bank also said on Jan. 27 that Bitcoin trade was highly speculative and that the unit carried a big risk of losing value.  “Citizens and legal entities risk being drawn - even unintentionally - into illegal activity, including laundering of money obtained through crime, as well as financing terrorism,” it warned.  The Prosecutor’s General Office said it was working with the central bank and other law enforcement agencies to tighten regulations and prevent legal offences committed with the use of pseudo-currencies.

210,Bitcoin nearly doubles in value from year's low hit in early February,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1G42P0,"February 20, 2018 03:38pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin hit a three-week high on Tuesday and has surged nearly 100 percent from its lowest level this year, as its recovery continued after South Korea’s financial regulator eased its stance on cryptocurrencies, weeks after it considered shutting down digital currency exchanges.  Analysts cited South Korean news agency Yonhap, which reported Choe Heung-sik, governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, as saying that the government will support cryptocurrency trading if “normal transactions” are made.  Reuters is unable to verify the Yonhap report.  “While the threat of heavy regulation, or even a total ban on exchange trading, has hovered over bitcoin in recent weeks, reports this morning that the South Korean government are softening their stance have given traders confidence to buy,” said Dennis de Jong, managing director, at online brokerage UFX.com in Limassol, Cyprus.  South Korea has been pushing for broad regulatory supervision of cryptocurrency trading as locals, including students and housewives, have entered the market despite inherent risks and warnings from policymakers around the world of a bubble.  Seoul previously said it was considering shutting down local cryptocurrency exchanges, which threw the market into turmoil and hammered bitcoin prices. Officials later clarified an outright ban is only one of the steps being considered, and a final decision was yet to be made.  On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin hit a three-week high of $11,722.58 BTC=BTSP on Tuesday. It was last up 3.4 percent at $11,555. From this year's low of $5,920 in early February, bitcoin has surged nearly 100 percent.  “Bitcoin’s price history suggests that months of consolidation are followed by weeks of rapid advancement,” said Canaccord Genuity in its latest research note.  “The safest way to benefit from potential bitcoin price appreciation is to buy and hold for the long term; trying to time it might be too difficult.”  Bitcoin has been pressured this year by a slew of regulatory initiatives around the world, including the incidence of hacks on exchanges. The latest hack occurred a few weeks ago when roughly $532.9 million in digital money was stolen from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck.  Other digital currencies, however, showed mixed results, diverging from bitcoin for now. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was down 1.3 percent over the past 24 hours at $935.02, while the third-largest, Ripple, fell 1.6 percent to $1.13, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.  Litecoin, the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was one of the biggest gainers with a 9.3 percent rise at $246.03. The currency jumped as much as 10 percent after a “hard fork” resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called litecoin cash.

211,Israeli startups dream of a Bitcoin world,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0L20G320140211,"February 11, 2014 06:39am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"* Hi-tech experts aim to develop digital currency  * New platforms would make Bitcoin easier to use  * Israeli venture capital firms look to invest  By Ari Rabinovitch  TEL AVIV, Feb 11 (Reuters) - “Welcome to the new economy,” boasts a sign at the entrance of the self-styled Bitcoin Embassy in the heart of Tel Aviv.  The sparely furnished property opened a few months ago to support a community of Bitcoin fanatics, perhaps the most active in the world, who are out to build just that - a next-generation trading system based on the digital currency.  At least two dozen startups have popped up in Israel over the past year with a view to creating tools that will allow the currency to be used in almost any kind of transaction - from buying shoes to sending remittances or issuing company stock.  Israeli companies are pioneers in hi-tech fields like cryptography, fraud prevention, and semiconductors, all of which interact with the Bitcoin universe.  That makes the country as much of a Bitcoin hotspot as Singapore or California’s Silicon Valley, says Eli Novershtern, principal of Israel’s biggest venture capital firm Pitango, which manages assets worth over $1.6 billion.  “We see a lot of activity here and are certainly looking to invest (in such firms), even significant sums if we recognise an attractive opportunity,” he said, without offering details of specific plans.  As a crypto-currency, Bitcoin is passed between two parties digitally and can be traded on exchanges for real-world currencies. Its value fluctuates according to user demand but it is not backed by any government or central bank.  New bitcoins come from a process called mining. Computer programmers around the world compete to crack an automatically generated code and the first to do so is rewarded with a small stash. This happens about every 10 minutes.  The maximum potential number of bitcoins in circulation is 21 million compared with around 12 million currently - meaning that, over time, the payoffs get smaller.  Enthusiasts hope the circulation limit and wider acceptance of the currency will mean its value goes up. One bitcoin is currently worth about $700, giving the currency a total potential market value of about $9 billion.  As recently as 2012 it was changing hands for $10.  Netanel Goldberg, 42, heads GetReal Platforms, a company he and two other graduates of Israel’s military cyber intelligence unit founded last year.  He foresees a “bloodbath” as ever stronger computer networks compete to mine the most bitcoins - a market he expects to grab a sizable chunk of, thanks to a silicon-based chip that GetReal is developing.  Bitcoin was spawned by a still unidentified developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, when the global financial crisis meant distrust of banks and governments was high.  Initially there was a libertarian appeal, said Ron Finberg, who runs the website Digital Currency Magnates.  But in Israel, technology had always been the currency’s driving force, he said. Now the “boundary-less system” was fostering ever more innovative applications.  Mathematician Meni Rosenfeld said his team is developing a product called “coloured coins” that will allow bitcoins to carry a secondary value, such as equity in a company.  A company will be able to take small fractions of a bitcoin, give them a digital marker, or “colour”, and distribute them to shareholders.  “They represent stock in every way,” said Rosenfeld, who is also chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association. The same could be done with bonds or car ownership, he said.  There has been a mixed reaction to Bitcoin around the world.  Supporters are drawn to its decentralised platform and say it is here to stay. Detractors call it a bubble and expect it to be forgotten in a year or two.  But its growing popularity is undeniable, and governments and regulators have been searching for the best way to respond.  “The Bank of Israel is ...examining the need for some sort of regulation regarding electronic, virtual and other similar currencies,” said Yoav Seffer, spokesman for the central bank.  Most retailers do not accept Bitcoin, making it hard for users to shop. One Tel Aviv startup, however, has shown that the convenience of using digital money can draw enormous interest.  AppCoin developed a programme that easily generates virtual currencies and teamed up with an online community of mothers in a trial run. The moms were given a new tender, called “hearts”, and agreed to use it to buy and sell items.  A year later the network swelled to 50,000 members with hundreds of transactions carried out each day.  The company plans to offer a service so anyone, anywhere can create their own currency, but for now it is focused on a beta-version it just released of a Bitcoin bazaar, called Satoshi Marketplace, accessible by phone to anyone in the world.  “Just as the internet revolutionized the way we exchange information, smartphones will redefine how people exchange value - by using digital currencies and virtual marketplaces,” said Eyal Hertzog, product architect at AppCoin.  Last month, members of the Bitcoin community and officials from the private sector and government gathered at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to discuss the future of the digital currency.  The assembly was hosted by Eden Shochat, founder of venture capital firm Aleph, which manages about $150 million.  “The ability to transfer value in a frictionless way without transaction fees represents a tidal wave, and when that happens our role is to help, advise and fund these kinds of companies,” he said.",0.25193000000000004,0.07857332251082252

Bitcoin has been buffeted this year by a series of negative headlines centering around increased scrutiny by global regulators. There has also been the incidence of hacks on exchanges, the latest being the theft of roughly $532.9 million in digital money from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck a few weeks ago.   The first digital currency was also affected by the risk-off mood that permeated financial markets since the beginning of the year, undermining views that bitcoin’s price moves are generally uncorrelated to other asset classes. Sentiment on risk assets  such as stocks and bitcoin has since improved.  Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, sees a new record peak for bitcoin by July, based on the currency’s 22 corrections since 2010.   On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin rose as high as $10,234 BTC=BTSP and was last at $10,123.12, up nearly 7 percent on the day.  (Graphic: Bitcoin daily chart - reut.rs/2stJIqQ)  “Bitcoin’s increase has coincided with the rally in global stock markets,” said Miles Eakers, chief market analyst, at FX brokerage Centtrip, adding that a sustained break above $10,000  could open the $12,000 level.  The original cryptocurrency gained more than 1,300 percent last year, capped by a lifetime peak just shy of $20,000 on Dec. 17.  Other digital currencies also rose after posting steep losses the last few weeks. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was up 2.5 percent over the past 24 hours at $933.24, while the third-largest, Ripple, gained 5.3 percent to $1.15, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.  (Graphic: Ethereum, Ripple price chart - reut.rs/2o5jGp5)  Fundstrat’s Lee said bitcoin is still in a bull market phase even after a 70 percent selloff.  “During bull periods, bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the duration of the decline and implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs—this is July 2018,” Lee said.  He added that 2018 will remain a strong year for cryptocurrencies, but he sees the larger and more established blockchain networks such as bitcoin and ethereum dominating again.  As bitcoin recovered, European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch warned in a speech in Paris on Thursday that bitcoin is not a currency, but a speculative digital asset, according to a Market News International report.  He added that because virtual currencies do not have a trusted issuer behind them, “they may become worthless at any time.”   Mersch said he is not surprised that virtual currencies are not widely accepted as a means of payment.

The Senate Banking Committee will take testimony from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton in early February, the source said.  Concerns about a bubble in the bitcoin market have heightened since the currency soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December - only to then slump more than 28 percent. On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $14,676, according to prices compiled by the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  The emerging asset class has created a divide among Wall Street and central bankers alike over whether it is a legitimate  and sustainable financial instrument.   The SEC and the CFTC have been increasing their jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding U.S. federal regulator. Both watchdogs have warned of the considerable risks posed by the volatile currency and have said they may not be able to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraudsters.   The CFTC last month allowed CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets Inc to list bitcoin futures contracts, but this month said it would review its process for listing digital currency futures following criticism from market participants.

218,"Bitcoin is an asset, not a currency - Israel's central bank",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EX18E,"January 08, 2018 08:16am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s central bank said on Monday it would not recognise virtual currencies such as bitcoin as actual currency and that it was difficult to devise regulations to monitor the risks of such activity to the country’s banks and their clients.  Deputy Governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg said there had been public complaints Israeli banks were making it difficult for some customers to transfer money from their accounts to buy bitcoin. But this was something the central bank would not be able to address. Other central banks faced the same problem.  “The Bank of Israel’s position is that they should be viewed as a financial asset,” Baudot-Trajtenberg told a meeting of Israel’s parliamentary finance committee, noting that there was no government responsibility for investors in bitcoin.  The central bank, Baudot-Trajtenberg said, was studying the issue of virtual currency but not much could be learned from what exists globally since no regulator anywhere in the world had issued guidelines to the banking system on how to act in relation to customers’ activity in virtual currencies.  “There is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity,” she said. “Beyond the risks to the customer there are also compliance risks to the bank.”  The value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading on Monday around $15,370.  Bitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital “coins”, which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country’s central bank. It is “mined” by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas.   Several other cryptocurrencies have been launched that work on similar principles.  Committee members during the meeting on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies urged Israel’s regulators to quickly come up with regulations.  “There seems to be a greater possibility that they will become central to our financial lives,” said Moshe Gafni, the chairman of the panel.   He called on regulators to submit to the committee within a month how they tend to deal with bitcoin and the like.  Still, Israel’s regulators are generally opposed to giving credence to virtual currencies since they are based on private initiatives and they do not have the same level of investor confidence as regular currencies.  “The anonymous nature of virtual currencies leads to the possibility that they may be used to launder money, finance crime, and so forth,” Baudot-Trajenberg said.  Shlomit Wagman, head of Israel’s anti-money-laundering authority said a thorough investigation was needed since terrorist organisations use virtual currency platforms.  Last week, Israel’s markets regulator proposed regulations that would ban from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange companies whose main business revolves around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

It added that Russian law stipulates that the rouble is the sole official currency and that introducing any other monetary units or substitutes was illegal.  Russia’s central bank also said on January 27 that Bitcoin trade was highly speculative and that the unit carried a big risk of losing value.  “Citizens and legal entities risk being drawn - even unintentionally - into illegal activity, including laundering of money obtained through crime, as well as financing terrorism,” it warned.  The Prosecutor’s General Office said it was working with the central bank and other law enforcement agencies to tighten regulations and prevent legal offences committed with the use of pseudo-currencies.

221,Cyber threat grows for bitcoin exchanges,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN11411T,"August 29, 2016 07:34am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When hackers penetrated a secure authentication system at a bitcoin exchange called Bitfinex earlier this month, they stole about $70 million worth of the virtual currency.  The cyber theft — the second largest by an exchange since hackers took roughly $350 million in bitcoins at Tokyo’s MtGox exchange in early 2014 — is hardly a rare occurrence in the emerging world of crypto-currencies.  New data disclosed to Reuters shows a third of bitcoin trading platforms have been hacked, and nearly half have closed in the half dozen years since they burst on the scene.   This rising risk for bitcoin holders is compounded by the fact there is no depositor’s insurance to absorb the loss, even though many exchanges act like virtual banks.  Not only does that approach cast the cyber security risk in stark relief, but it also exposes the fact that bitcoin investors have little choice but to do business with under-capitalized exchanges that may not have the capital buffer to absorb these losses the way a traditional and regulated bank or exchange would.  “There is a general sense in the bitcoin community that any centralized repository is at risk,” said a U.S.-based professional trader who lost about $1,000 in bitcoins when Bitfinex was hacked. He declined to be named for this article.  “So when investing, you always have that expectation at the back of your head. I lost a small amount compared to the others, but I know of traders who lost millions of dollars worth of bitcoins,” the trader said.  The security challenge for the bitcoin world does not appear to be letting up, according to experts in the currency.   “I am skeptical there’s going to be any technological silver bullet that’s going to solve security breach problems. No technology, crypto-currency, or financial mechanism can be made safe from hacks,” said Tyler Moore, assistant professor of cyber security at the University of Tulsa’s Tandy School of Computer Science who will soon publish the new research on the vulnerability of bitcoin exchanges.  His study, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and shared with Reuters, shows that since bitcoin’s creation in 2009 to March 2015, 33 percent of all bitcoin exchanges operational during that period were hacked. The figure represents one of the first estimates of the extent of security breaches in the bitcoin world.  In contrast, data from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a non-profit organization, showed that of the 6,000 operational U.S. banks, only 67 banks experienced a publicly-disclosed data breach between 2009 and 2015. That’s roughly 1 percent of U.S. banks.   Among the world’s stock exchanges, however, security breaches are much higher, with hackers attracted to the large pools of cash moving in and out of these trading venues. The latest survey of 46 securities exchanges released three years ago by the International Organization of Securities Commissions and World Federation of Exchanges found that more than half had experienced a cyber attack.  Moore collaborated on the research with Nicolas Christin, associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University and Janos Szurdi, a Ph.D. student also at Carnegie.      In 2013, Moore and Christin wrote a research paper on security risks surrounding bitcoin exchanges when Moore was still a professor at Southern Methodist University. That research entitled “Beware of the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin Exchange Risk” was peer-reviewed and presented at the 17th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference in Okinawa, Japan in 2013.  In the most recent study, the rate of closure for bitcoin exchanges in Moore’s research edged up to 48 percent among those operating from 2009 to March 2015. Hacking did not necessarily trigger the closure in each case.  “A 48 percent closure is not acceptable, but not surprising given that bitcoin is a new technology,” said Richard Johnson, vice president of market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates. Johnson has written reports on risk and security issues in the crypto-currency world.  Profitability is a big problem for bitcoin exchanges, with many of them unable to generate enough volume to keep afloat.   Bitcoin exchanges overall could be launched for as low as $100,000 up to $1 million, said Erik Voorhees, founder and chief executive officer of digital currency exchange ShapeShift. That is a fraction of what U.S. forex exchanges’ are required to put up.  Retail FX trading platform FXCM, for instance, is required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have at least $25 million in capital at all times.   A key factor tied to the risk posed by exchanges is whether customers are reimbursed after closure or after the loss of bitcoins following a hack. Each closure and breach have been handled differently, but Tandy’s Moore said the risk of losing funds stored in exchanges are real.  In the case of Bitfinex, which is now up and running after the hack August 2, customers lost 36 percent of the assets they had on the platform and were compensated for the losses with tokens of credit that would be converted into equity in the parent company.  At Tokyo’s MtGox, customers have yet to recover their investments more than two years after closure.  Experts say trading venues acting like banks such as Bitfinex will remain vulnerable. These exchanges act as custodial wallets in which they control users’ digital currencies like banks control customer deposits.  “The big exchanges that hold customer deposits are a big target for hackers,” said ShapeShift’s Voorhees, “and unfortunately most bitcoin exchanges store user funds.”   When customers’ checking accounts are hacked, there is always a third party at the bank that can step in to deal with the theft.   Not so with bitcoin, said Seattle-based Darin Stanchfield, chief executive officer at KeepKey, a hardware wallet provider. He expects more of these attacks to happen despite efforts to improve security at bitcoin exchanges.  “Unfortunately because of its irreversible nature, bitcoin requires near perfect security.”  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Edward Tobin",-0.02349318181818183,0.060990936147186155

DISH Network on May 29 said it would accept Bitcoin as a form of customer  payment beginning in the third quarter of this year. Expedia said in June that  it would begin accepting Bitcoin as  payment for hotel reservations, while  online retailer Newegg just announced that it would accept Bitcoin as well. In mid-June, Apple made virtual currency app Coin Pocket available for download  in its App Store. Coin Pocket is a Bitcoin wallet app that can be used to send  and receive bitcoins. As was widely reported, Apple recently added a rule to its  App Store guidelines stating ""apps may facilitate transmission of approved  virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and  federal laws for the territories in which the app functions."" Companies like DISH, Expedia, and Newegg generate meaningful revenue and an  increase in payment for products and services via Bitcoin could boost the  payment system. However, as we've stated previously, Bitcoin is still small  relative to both major payment processors and global currencies despite  increases in its acceptance as a payment system. Bitcoin's price and transaction volume have climbed since mid-May, reversing  downward trends earlier in the year. The price of Bitcoin rose from $489 on May  21 to $639 on June 30.

Fed blog post,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1PZ0P1,"February 09, 2018 09:22am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin and other digital currencies have, so far, not been formidable competition for cash, checks or credit cards as a payment method in the United States and other major economies, according to two economists at New York Federal Reserve.  Virtual currencies usually thrive as an alternative form of payment during times of suspicion around traditional forms of payment, they said in a blog post published on Friday.  For example, in 2015, as Greece struggled with its debt problem, Greek interest and trading in bitcoin jumped amid worries over capital controls and a possible exit from the euro zone, the New York Fed economists, Michael Lee and Antoine Martin said.  “Cryptocurrencies arguably solve the problem of making payments in a trustless environment, but it is not obvious that this is a problem that needs solving, at least in the United States and other advanced economies,” the post said.    Indeed, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies, while they have grown in use and popularity, have notable drawbacks, the economists said.  With bitcoin, extreme volatility tends to undermine its function of storing value. This is unlike a traditional currency that is managed by a central bank, they said.  Bitcoin transactions also consume a lot of electricity and it takes time to validate transactions, the economists said.  Right now, bitcoin transactions are estimated to use 48 terawatt hours of energy a year, an amount which could power 4.4 million of U.S. homes, according to Digiconomist, a blog about cryptocurrencies that Lee and Martin cited in their post.      Cash and other traditional payment methods also offer convenience, a formidable advantage relative to cryptocurrencies, the economists said.   “Fundamentally, we wonder whether a payment method designed to function where trust in institutions is completely absent can ever be as convenient as one where trust is required, but also already exists,” Lee and Martin wrote.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP has seen its value tumble as much as 70 percent from a record peak near $20,000 in mid-December. On Friday, it was at $8,414.34 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   “In a world where all things were priced in bitcoin, this would likely translate into massive swings in inflation and economic activity,” they said.

230,Breakingviews - Chancellor: Bitcoin will never be real money,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EY2MD,"January 09, 2018 04:33pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s easy enough to identify bitcoin and its ilk as being caught up in a speculative mania. A more difficult and important question is whether crypto-currencies have any future as money. In a world where the stability of conventional currencies is threatened globally by the vast expansion of central-bank balance sheets, high government indebtedness and the myriad ill consequences of ultra-low interest rates, it would be nice to believe this was the case. Yet bitcoin and its peers are not money and, unless they change fundamentally, never will be.  Bitcoin possesses many of the characteristics of a proper currency: it can be divided, stored (provided it’s not with a dodgy broker where it’s liable to disappear into the ether) and transferred. And its supply is limited. Money is just a social technology which has been through many previous incarnations – among the exotic varieties of cash listed by Paul Einzig in his book “Primitive Money” 70 years ago are gin, jam, mulberry cakes, rat traps (in the Congo), and woodpecker scalps. Most of our current money is already held in digital form as electronic book entries at the bank. At first glance, bitcoin with its distributed ledger appears to be simply an advance on the current financial technology.  Its fervid exponents have even greater hopes. They claim that crypto-currencies hail the end of state-controlled money. Their vision is borrowed from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, who envisaged a denationalisation of money that would bring about an end to both inflation and deflation, cure unemployment and result in the abolition of easy-money-peddling central banks, thereby limiting the reach of governments. What’s not to like?  The trouble is that bitcoin enthusiasts confuse the characteristics of money with its nature. This is a thorny subject. Mainstream economic theory has little to say on what money is, assuming it is a contrivance simply to do away with the bother of barter. In the era when bank notes were redeemable in gold, most people believed that money had the intrinsic value of the precious metal. But as John Law, who was responsible for the Mississippi Co bubble in the early 18th century, pointed out: “Money is not the value by which goods are exchanged but the value for which they are exchanged.” Simply put, gold derived much of its value from its use as money rather than the other way around.  Where, then, does money get its value? From the earliest times, going back at least to Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C., money has been defined as a unit of account authorized by government for the payment of debts. The state theory of money holds that money is a credit issued by a sovereign, whose value comes from the fact that it can be used to pay taxes. Governments have tenaciously maintained control over the unit of account, a key aspect of sovereignty. The law prescribes this official money as legal tender for the repayment of debt.  Law and his contemporaries had another insight, namely that credit when it circulates acts as money. In the 18th century, much of what constituted money in England comprised bills of exchange issued by merchants against future receipts. At the same time, early English bankers were learning to create money through the act of lending. This bank money was backed by claims of real economic value. The credit theory of money maintains that money is just circulating credit. “Currency is ephemeral and cosmetic: it is the underlying mechanism of credit accounts and clearing that is the essence of money,” Felix Martin writes in his 2013 book “Money”.  The economic system commonly referred to as capitalism consists of a vast network of credit relations. Credit money is its key feature. Hayek, of course, realised this. His proposals to strip the government of its money monopoly envisaged the replacement of a dominant central bank with competing private money-issuing banks. Competition between the currency banks would thus produce a sounder currency. But Hayek’s money would still be of the credit variety.  Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are a different kettle of fish. They purport to be non-credit currencies - that is, monetary assets without corresponding liabilities. Yet all money is by its nature a claim upon society, otherwise it cannot be spent. And why should society wish to confer vast monetary claims on the enterprising nerds and opportunistic speculators currently in possession of crypto-fortunes? More importantly, because crypto-currencies lack a mechanism for creating credit they are not well suited to the capitalist economy. Imagine what would happen if bitcoin were accepted as the monetary unit of account. The result would be a scarcity of the digital currency followed by a severe economic contraction and stagnation without end.  This is not going to happen. Not just because it makes no economic sense but because governments are never going to relinquish their monopoly over money any sooner than they will surrender their monopoly on violence. However desirable in theory it may be, Hayek’s proposal to denationalise money was just a pipe dream. As the Nobel laureate economist wrote: “Everybody knows that if such a private experiment promised to succeed, governments would at once step in to prevent it.”  Everybody, that is, apart from the speculators in crypto-currencies. Some of them privately concede that bitcoin may never become money as such, but say that it will retain value as an asset in the same way that gold survived its demonetisation. The counter-argument is that gold has a very long history, an extraordinary durability and a great inherent beauty which lends it enduring lustre, while bitcoin is just a clever piece of open-source software.  This is not to say that the blockchain and similar associated technologies have no future. The new high flyer, ripple, is working with banks to improve the global payments system. It’s a more modest aim than creating a new class of money - but a far more practical one. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

237,A yearlong trip around the world — using only bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS209596304820150818,"August 18, 2015 01:00am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"By Tania Karas   TEL AVIV, Israel — Felix Weis has gotten used to blank stares anytime he tries to pay for something. Since January, the 28-year-old freelance computer programmer from Luxembourg has been on a trip around the world using only bitcoin.  Most store clerks, bartenders and tour operators he’s encountered have never heard of the virtual currency. But that is what Weis intended. He is targeting ordinary people rather than tech geeks who already understand it.  “Bitcoin is the most exciting global socioeconomic experiment right now,” Weis said. “I really believe in it.”  As proof of his devotion to the six-year-old currency, Weis converted all his money into bitcoin and cut up his credit card. He carries the two halves in a clear plastic bag for anyone who doubts his seriousness.  Often three or four people gather to listen as he — usually — convinces someone to accept it as payment. Then he pulls out a selfie stick. In the 14 countries Weis has visited so far, he has snapped dozens of photos with first-time bitcoin users holding up their smartphones to show off their first transaction. That includes this reporter.  Bitcoin was invented as an alternative to government-run monetary systems, and allows users to make payments instantly and anonymously, even across borders, with no need for a bank or other third party. It can be used to buy goods and services, traded for traditional currency on a bitcoin exchange, or stored in a virtual “wallet.”  The virtual currency is controlled by an international network of computers, rather than a central bank or government. Its underlying technology is the blockchain, a sort of public ledger of each bitcoin transaction. Thousands of specialized computers worldwide verify transactions using a computer code that — in theory — is unbreakable. That transparency and cryptographic proof are bitcoin’s appeal for users who distrust banks or government-backed currencies — or would like to keep their transactions out of sight.  To use bitcoin, you need to first download a bitcoin wallet app to your smartphone. Then you can buy bitcoins online through an exchange, or in person through a local seller. Websites such as spendbitcoins.com show where you can spend bitcoin in your area.  Its potential advantages for frequent travelers are obvious: paying by bitcoin is instantaneous, with no need to exchange currency in each country or pay foreign transaction fees.  Weis intends to visit 21 countries by the end of the year to symbolize the 21 million bitcoins that can ever come into use, as designed by the currency’s mysterious founder, who is known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The name is widely believed to be fake.  Weis sticks to three rules: He must use bitcoin whenever possible to pay for food, accommodations and travel. He can never use a debit or credit card. And he may use limited amounts of local currency, but only if he obtains it by exchanging bitcoin for physical money with local people found via a special website, localbitcoins.com.  So far he has visited much of Europe, plus Turkey, Israel and Ukraine. To book his travel, Weis uses travel companies that accept the digital currency. Expedia.com customers can use it to pay for hotel bookings, while CheapAir takes it for hotels and flights.  After a free historical tour of the Israeli port city Jaffa, Weis had offered to tip his tour guide in bitcoin. To do so, he had her download a bitcoin wallet app to her smartphone, then used his own phone to scan the wallet’s QR code. Within seconds the guide possessed the bitcoin equivalent of 30 shekels. Finally, Weis pulled up a map of Tel Aviv on Coinmap.org to show her all the nearby stores, restaurants and services where she could spend it.  In other countries, Weis has used the virtual currency to pay for scuba diving lessons, paragliding and bungee jumping. Weis’ experiences in each country vary widely depending on bitcoin adoption rates and awareness. Sometimes he has a limited choice of stores, restaurants and activities, and he can’t always persuade merchants to take a chance on a new currency.  For a few days in Varna, Bulgaria, Weis’ only meal was the complimentary hotel breakfast. Budapest and Berlin had the most places that took bitcoin. In Turkey in May, Weis celebrated “Bitcoin Pizza Day” — the anniversary of the first real-world transaction using bitcoin in 2010 — two days late because it took him that long to find a pizzeria he could convince to accept it.  Despite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Weis does not encourage others to go to the same extremes. As with any digital technology, bitcoin wallets are susceptible to hacking or file corruption. But unlike bank-issued cards, bitcoins aren’t overseen by an authority that can help in those situations.  The currency is highly volatile: At one point in 2013, the price per bitcoin soared to more than $1,200 and crashed 70 percent a month later. Days after he started his trip, Weis thought he would have to cut it short by two months when the price dropped to $180. He’d budgeted for a year with bitcoin selling for at least $250. It now trades around $255 on the Bitstamp exchange.  Last week, Weis flew to Hong Kong to begin the Asian leg of his journey. He will go to South America later in the fall. He hopes to learn more about how bitcoin is used differently depending on economic factors, he said. In the Philippines, for instance, personal remittances make up 10 percent of the GDP. Bitcoin makes it cheaper to transfer money, because there’s little to no fee.  Weis’ last stop will be Berlin, where his trip began and where he’s thinking about creating a software startup to make using bitcoin “easier and safer for the average person.” He says he would like to get paid in bitcoin and plans to keep his savings in the digital currency as well.  Said Weis: “Now that I know it’s possible to live off bitcoin in 14 countries, why go back to the boring old system?”    ",0.08037924528301886,0.033255431675242995

239,Bitcoin may not be worth all the hoopla: N.Y. Fed blog post,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1FT231,"February 09, 2018 11:30am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin and other digital currencies have, so far, not been formidable competition for cash, checks or credit cards as a payment method in the United States and other major economies, according to two economists at New York Federal Reserve.  Virtual currencies usually thrive as an alternative form of payment during times of suspicion around traditional forms of payment, they said in a blog post published on Friday.  For example, in 2015, as Greece struggled with its debt problem, Greek interest and trading in bitcoin jumped amid worries over capital controls and a possible exit from the euro zone, the New York Fed economists, Michael Lee and Antoine Martin said.  “Cryptocurrencies arguably solve the problem of making payments in a trustless environment, but it is not obvious that this is a problem that needs solving, at least in the United States and other advanced economies,” the post said.    Indeed, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies, while they have grown in use and popularity, have notable drawbacks, the economists said.  With bitcoin, extreme volatility tends to undermine its function of storing value. This is unlike a traditional currency that is managed by a central bank, they said.  Bitcoin transactions also consume a lot of electricity and it takes time to validate transactions, the economists said.  Right now, bitcoin transactions are estimated to use 48 terawatt hours of energy a year, an amount which could power 4.4 million of U.S. homes, according to Digiconomist, a blog about cryptocurrencies that Lee and Martin cited in their post.      Cash and other traditional payment methods also offer convenience, a formidable advantage relative to cryptocurrencies, the economists said.   “Fundamentally, we wonder whether a payment method designed to function where trust in institutions is completely absent can ever be as convenient as one where trust is required, but also already exists,” Lee and Martin wrote.  Bitcoin BTC=BTSP has seen its value tumble as much as 70 percent from a record peak near $20,000 in mid-December. On Friday, it was at $8,414.34 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   “In a world where all things were priced in bitcoin, this would likely translate into massive swings in inflation and economic activity,” they said.

240,"Behind bitcoin boom, Japanese retail investors pile in",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E70IT,"December 13, 2017 05:43am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s army of retail investors, no strangers to high risk bets in the past, have emerged as a major force in bitcoin’s spectacular rally, now accounting for an estimated 30-50 percent of trading in the cryptocurrency as it spikes to record highs.  Once skeptics, Japanese retail investors have been attracted by the digital currency’s volatility and inefficiencies in pricing that create opportunities to make money on arbitrage between exchanges.  “When I first heard about the bitcoin a few years ago, I thought it was a fraud,” said Yoshinori Kobayashi, 39, a former stock trader who took up bitcoin trading two-and-a-half years ago.  “But I tried it out after I had come to know some people making money on it. I bought it at 60,000 yen, which quickly become 80,000 yen and I started to regret I hadn’t started earlier,” said Kobayashi, who believes bitcoin is on a long uptrend but took some profits last week.   The spectacular surge in bitcoin, up more than 16-fold this year to above $17,000, has drawn comparisons to the 1970s gold spike or Japanese shares’ rally in the 1980s’ go-go era. Both of those delivered massive gains to Japanese retail investors before plunging sharply.     Statistics on bitcoin and crypto-currencies are patchy because their trading is unregulated in most countries.   According to data compiled by Jpbitcoin.com, a Japanese bitcoin website, yen-based bitcoin trades reached a record 4.51 million bitcoins in November, almost a half of the total of the world’s major exchanges of 9.29 million bitcoin.  Industry officials say not all yen-based bitcoin trading is done by Japanese retail players as some hedge funds now trade bitcoin in the yen to take advantage of price differentials between the yen and dollar prices.  Still, many industry officials estimate Japanese account for somewhere between a third and half of global bitcoin trade.  Japan’s global share of the bitcoin market jumped after a clampdown this year by Beijing saw bitcoin trading in yuan almost entirely disappear.  South Korea, another key centre for bitcoin trade, said it would hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the trading of cryptocurrencies amid calls for tighter regulation.   Japan’s approach to bitcoin has encouraged retail investor interest.   The Japanese government in April granted cryptocurrencies legal status as a means of settlement and in September officially recognized 11 digital currencies exchanges.   Also in September, the tax agency issued clarification that revenues from bitcoin will be treated as income, from which  trading losses can be deducted.  That eased concerns that profits from bitcoin might be taxed like gambling, where gains will be taxed but losses will not be regarded as costs.  Some investors including Kobayashi also feel affinity to bitcoin partly because its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, is said to be Japanese, though the true identity of the father of the blockchain technology is shrouded in mystery.     Trading at Japanese major bitcoin exchanges grew to 4.51 million bitcoin in November from 1.19 million in April. In dollar terms, it has surged to $35.4 billion in November from $1.45 billion in April.  A lack of major institutional investors is providing retail investors a rare chance to become dominant players, with primitive pricing leaving opportunities for savvy traders, market participants say.  Even within dollar based exchanges, it is not uncommon to see a price in one exchange 10 percent higher than another exchange, for example. Then there are often gaps of more than 10 percent between yen-based bitcoin price and dollar-based price.  “Most Japanese traders don’t even bother to check the dollar price,” said a veteran financial trader, who started bitcoin in September.  The trader also said bitcoin’s moves after it rose above 100,000 yen ($880) are very similar to what happened in a big rally in gold and silver in the past.   “They both rallied very quickly after having broken out many years of range-bound trading,” he said.  Indeed, many traders say technical analysis works remarkably well when it comes to bitcoin. Hiroyuki Kato has traded cryptocurrencies for two years, spending two to three hours a day studying the patterns and ratios popular in technical analysis on his smartphone or computer terminal.    “I use Bollinger Band, MACD, the stuff everyone knows. It’s easier to win in bitcoin than in FX and stocks,” said Kato, who quit his sales job at a trading firm about two years ago to focus on trading cryptocurrencies and other assets.

241,UPDATE 1-Qatar central bank warns against trading in bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1PY39W,"February 08, 2018 07:04am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Adds context)  By Hadeel Al Sayegh  DOHA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Qatar’s central bank has warned financial institutions in the country not to trade in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, according to financial sources and a circular seen by Reuters.  Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have come under increasing global regulatory scrutiny amid wild swings in prices for the emerging asset class. Having peaked at almost $20,000 in December, Bitcoin was trading at about $8,550 on Thursday.  The letter sent to financial institutions by the Qatar central bank said it “politely requested banks and exchange houses in the country not to deal in any way with this currency, or exchange it with another currency, or open accounts to deal with it, or send or receive any money transfers for the purpose of buying or selling this currency”.  The central bank added that failure to comply with its request could result in penalties under existing legislation.  Commercial bankers in Qatar told Reuters that banks in the tiny but super-rich country, the world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas, were already avoiding involvement with bitcoin.  However, Internet postings suggest that some Qatar residents have been buying bitcoin through online exchanges or exploring the possibility of investing in the virtual currency.  Qatar’s move appeared to be the strongest action taken so far among the wealthy Gulf oil-exporting countries to curb trade in bitcoin. But several other regulators in the region have expressed concern about cryptocurrencies.  Last July the Saudi Arabian central bank advised people not to trade bitcoin because it was outside the bank’s regulatory reach, though it did not impose an outright ban.  In October the United Arab Emirates central bank said it did not recognise bitcoin as an official currency, and this week the UAE’s securities regulator warned the public about the risks of using digital tokens. Oman’s central bank has issued a similar warning, local media has reported.  In December the UAE’s central bank said it was working with its Saudi Arabian counterpart to issue a digital currency based on blockchain technology that would be accepted in cross-border transactions between the two countries. It said the currency would be used among banks to make their transactions more efficient, not by individual consumers.

242,"Behind bitcoin boom, Japanese retail investors pile in",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N1O81FO,"December 13, 2017 01:00am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s army of retail investors, no strangers to high risk bets in the past, have emerged as a major force in bitcoin’s spectacular rally, now accounting for an estimated 30-50 percent of trading in the cryptocurrency as it spikes to record highs.  Once skeptics, Japanese retail investors have been attracted by the digital currency’s volatility and inefficiencies in pricing that create opportunities to make money on arbitrage between exchanges.  “When I first heard about the bitcoin a few years ago, I thought it was a fraud,” said Yoshinori Kobayashi, 39, a former stock trader who took up bitcoin trading two-and-a-half years ago.  “But I tried it out after I had come to know some people making money on it. I bought it at 60,000 yen, which quickly become 80,000 yen and I started to regret I hadn’t started earlier,” said Kobayashi, who believes bitcoin is on a long uptrend but took some profits last week.   The spectacular surge in bitcoin, up more than 16-fold this year to above $17,000, has drawn comparisons to the 1970s gold spike or Japanese shares’ rally in the 1980s’ go-go era. Both of those delivered massive gains to Japanese retail investors before plunging sharply.     Statistics on bitcoin and crypto-currencies are patchy because their trading is unregulated in most countries.   According to data compiled by Jpbitcoin.com, a Japanese bitcoin website, yen-based bitcoin trades reached a record 4.51 million bitcoins in November, almost a half of the total of the world’s major exchanges of 9.29 million bitcoin.  Industry officials say not all yen-based bitcoin trading is done by Japanese retail players as some hedge funds now trade bitcoin in the yen to take advantage of price differentials between the yen and dollar prices.  Still, many industry officials estimate Japanese account for somewhere between a third and half of global bitcoin trade.  Japan’s global share of the bitcoin market jumped after a clampdown this year by Beijing saw bitcoin trading in yuan almost entirely disappear.  South Korea, another key centre for bitcoin trade, said it would hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the trading of cryptocurrencies amid calls for tighter regulation.   Japan’s approach to bitcoin has encouraged retail investor interest.   The Japanese government in April granted cryptocurrencies legal status as a means of settlement and in September officially recognized 11 digital currencies exchanges.   Also in September, the tax agency issued clarification that revenues from bitcoin will be treated as income, from which  trading losses can be deducted.  That eased concerns that profits from bitcoin might be taxed like gambling, where gains will be taxed but losses will not be regarded as costs.  Some investors including Kobayashi also feel affinity to bitcoin partly because its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, is said to be Japanese, though the true identity of the father of the blockchain technology is shrouded in mystery.     Trading at Japanese major bitcoin exchanges grew to 4.51 million bitcoin in November from 1.19 million in April. In dollar terms, it has surged to $35.4 billion in November from $1.45 billion in April.  A lack of major institutional investors is providing retail investors a rare chance to become dominant players, with primitive pricing leaving opportunities for savvy traders, market participants say.  Even within dollar based exchanges, it is not uncommon to see a price in one exchange 10 percent higher than another exchange, for example. Then there are often gaps of more than 10 percent between yen-based bitcoin price and dollar-based price.  “Most Japanese traders don’t even bother to check the dollar price,” said a veteran financial trader, who started bitcoin in September.  The trader also said bitcoin’s moves after it rose above 100,000 yen ($880) are very similar to what happened in a big rally in gold and silver in the past.   “They both rallied very quickly after having broken out many years of range-bound trading,” he said.  Indeed, many traders say technical analysis works remarkably well when it comes to bitcoin. Hiroyuki Kato has traded cryptocurrencies for two years, spending two to three hours a day studying the patterns and ratios popular in technical analysis on his smartphone or computer terminal.    “I use Bollinger Band, MACD, the stuff everyone knows. It’s easier to win in bitcoin than in FX and stocks,” said Kato, who quit his sales job at a trading firm about two years ago to focus on trading cryptocurrencies and other assets.  Among some financial professionals, there is growing talk that the meteoric rise in bitcoin resembles the “tulip mania” bubble in the Netherlands in the 17th century that burst spectacularly. However, many Japanese traders expect bitcoin’s stellar run to continue for some time yet.  “The world’s total financial assets is around 10 quadrillion yen, and bitcoin is only just about 0.1 percent of that, which seems way too small if we assume the use of bitcoin spreads,” Kobayashi said.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it would convene its technology and risk advisory committees this month to discuss its “self-certification” process for listing digital currency futures and how those products are risk-managed and policed.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASSA) have issued new warnings to investors over the risks of investing in bitcoin, cautioning regulators may not be able to protect them from fraudsters.   CME Group Inc (CME.O) and CBOE Global Markets Inc CBOE.O launched bitcoin futures in December, sparking criticism from some industry participants who said the regulator should have consulted the market more widely before allowing the products.  In December, the Futures Industry Association wrote to the CFTC expressing concern about the risks potentially posed by allowing futures in volatile virtual currencies to be traded alongside more traditional financial products.   The price of bitcoin soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December, only to slump more than 28 percent - although it still ended the year up 1,300 percent.   The CFTC has been increasing its jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding federal regulator, but is restricted by its limited legal power to actively block exchanges from launching futures products.  CFTC regulations allow designated exchanges to list products for trading without prior CFTC approval by filing a written self-certification with the regulator.  Under the self-certification process, which is a quirk of the futures market, the exchanges file a submission to the CFTC confirming the product complies with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations - including a key provision that requires that the contract is not susceptible to manipulation.

The OMF said it had received $4 million on Friday, having received $1 million from the same donor last month, via the account that it holds with BitPay, a bitcoin payments firm that converted the donation into U.S. dollars.  The money came from an anonymous donor calling themselves “Pine” from the Pineapple Fund, whose website says that it has already donated around $37 million anonymously to various charities and projects. The fund intends to donate $86 million in total, according to the website.  “Donating $86 million of bitcoins to charity because once you have enough money, money doesn’t matter,” the website states. It also says the fund holds one of the top-250 richest bitcoin wallets in the world, with “Pine” having got into the market early.   Bitcoin allows money to be sent anonymously across a peer-to-peer global network, with no intermediaries needed to validate or process transactions. That has made it attractive to those who want to keep their identity secret, including those buying and selling illegal goods and services on the internet.  OMF set up its BitPay around a year ago to enable anonymous donations. Until now, though, the take-up has been low, with the total bitcoin donated in the thousands of dollars.   “This significant donation will help OMF accelerate and expand current research into ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis), CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) and other chronic complex diseases and to keep fighting for a better future for patients,” said Linda Tannenbaum, founder and president of OMF.  Tannenbaum said OMF had conversations back and forth with the donor, but she did not know his or her identity.   “I’ve recently received letters of support from esteemed academics in the field strongly supporting OMF, and that helped me make the decision!” wrote “Pine” in one message.

Depending on where you look, the virtual currency hit the $10,000 milestone some time between Tuesday and early Wednesday in several digital currency exchanges.  On Wednesday, bitcoin hit an all-time high of $11,395 BTC=BTSP, on the Luxembourg-based BitStamp, one of the largest and most liquid digital currency exchanges. But by mid-afternoon in New York, bitcoin was back below $10,000, an expected pullback after a steep rally.   Despite widespread scepticism of many veteran bankers and fund managers, bitcoin is being propelled by a continued influx of retail buyers as well as promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional investors, analysts said.Created in 2009, bitcoin tracks the ideas set out in a  white paper by an individual or group of individuals called Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be revealed. It promises lower transaction fees than traditional online payment systems and is not regulated by any government or entity.   Enthusiasts and supporters of bitcoin are attracted by its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. But the risks of dealing in bitcoin were exposed in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange MtGox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.   Bitcoin is a far cry from those early beginnings.   The $10,000 level when it happened was a key turning point for this digital asset and a critical moment for the crypto-currency space in general. (For a graphic on Bitcoin's blistering ascent - Price, click tmsnrt.rs/2AFGqEe)  “Investors will be looking to take profits and re-evaluate their positions. There will be some churn as overweight bitcoiners wash into other cryptos searching for yield,” said Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive officer of CryptoCompare, an interactive crypto-currency platform.  Bitcoin took 834 days to top $1,000 from the time that BitStamp started to track the price in August 2011. It took another 1,270 days to hit $2,000 on May 20, 2017. However, the price has surged in the later half of 2017, crossing successive $1,000 milestones with ever increasing speed on its march toward  $10,000.  As bitcoin soars, the virtual currency market now has market capitalisation -- its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system -- of more than $300 billion. Bitcoin accounts for more than 50 percent of that market cap.

Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets launched the futures late on Sunday, marking the first time investors could get exposure to the bitcoin market via a large, regulated exchange.  The one-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:> opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460. By late afternoon  on Monday in New York, it was trading at $18,650, roughly 8 percent above bitcoin’s spot price of $16,900 on the Bitstamp exchange.   Bitcoin earlier hit a record high of $17,270.   Its steep gains and rapid rise have attracted investors around the world as well as intense scrutiny from government regulators, which is the very opposite of what its creators wanted when it first launched bitcoin more than eight years ago.    “The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.   Taylor believes that based on his charts, bitcoin has not yet peaked, but as soon as the “upmove ends, it will crash.”  Given bitcoin has almost tripled in value over the past month, and was up more than 15 percent on Monday alone, the futures pricing suggested investors see price increases moderating.  Bitcoin futures were already offered on some unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges outside the United States, but backers said the U.S. market debut would confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and encourage its wider use.  The CME Group is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.  Graphic - Bitcoin futures suggest growth, but slower: reut.rs/2yfblkV  Although there are hopes that the futures will draw in new investors, most fund managers at larger asset managers and institutional investors said bitcoin remains too volatile and lacks the fundamentals that give other assets value.   “There’s no place for bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio given the very high volatility,” said Robeco Chief Investment Officer Lukas Daalder.  The two-month contract was trading at $18,750, an 11 percent premium over the spot price, while the three-month contract was changing hands at $18,140, a roughly 12 percent premium.     While modest when compared with bitcoin’s 270 percent increase over the past three months and 230 percent rise in the last two months, those levels still indicated a lack of large “short” positions betting against bitcoin.   “Anyone, especially a professional trading outfit, would be crazy to actually short sell this bull market,” said Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC. “But just because it doesn’t happen on day one doesn’t mean it won’t in the future.”  Bitcoin was up more than 1,600 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000.      As of early afternoon trading in New York, 3,951 one-month contracts had changed hands, meaning around $73.1 million had been notionally traded. That compares with daily trading volumes of more than $21.5 billion across all cryptocurrencies, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.   There had been speculation that the futures launch would trigger more gyrations in the market. But while volatile compared with traditional currencies or assets, the rise on Monday was relatively tame for bitcoin.   Bitcoin surged more than 40 percent in 48 hours last week, before tumbling 20 percent in the following 10 hours.   “(Bitcoin futures) will speed up the march towards legitimisation of an asset class that only a few years ago many law enforcement agencies would have argued had limited legitimate reasons for people to use,” said Jo Torode, a financial crime lawyer at Ropes & Gray in London.   The futures are cash-settled contracts, allowing investors exposure without having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.   The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.   Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.  Central bankers and critics of the cryptocurrency have been ringing the alarm bells over its surge in price and other risks such as whether the opaque market can be used for money laundering.  “It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me,” the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Acting Governor Grant Spencer said on Sunday.  Somebody who invested $1,000 in bitcoin at the start of 2013 would now be sitting on around $1.2 million.      Heightened excitement ahead of the launch of the Cboe futures gave an extra kick to the cryptocurrency’s scorching run this year.  The launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.  Several online brokerages, including Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, did not allow trading of the new futures immediately.   The Financial Times reported on Friday that JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc would not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it was planning to clear such trades for certain clients.

256,UPDATE 2-Number of crypto hedge funds surges amid bitcoin volatility,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1Q53T8,"February 15, 2018 01:45pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds focused on trading cryptocurrencies have struggled to eke out returns this year amid a sharp sell-off in the highly volatile market, in spite of a flood of new funds setting up to deploy investor cash.  The number of crypto hedge funds more than doubled in the four months to Feb. 15, data from fintech research house Autonomous NEXT showed on Thursday.  The research firm recorded a record high of 226 global hedge funds with such a strategy, up from 110 global hedge funds as of Oct. 18. That itself was up from 55 funds at Aug. 29 and just 37 at the start of 2017.  (For the graphic 'Crypto funds flood the market' click - reut.rs/2o0QAaq)   Assets under management hit between $3.5 and $5 billion (3.55 billion pounds), according to the Autonomous NEXT.  The surge in funds comes at a volatile time for the cryptocurrencies they trade in. After hitting a record high close to $20,000 in December, bitcoin BTC=BTSP lost 70 percent of its value to slip below $6,000 in January, posting its worst monthly performance in three years.  Bitcoin has since recovered some of those falls, but at just below $10,000 is still only worth around half what it was a month ago.   Rival cryptocurrencies have also seen sharp declines. The so-called “market cap” of all virtual currencies - their price multiplied by the number of coins issued - currently stands at around $465 billion, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, down from more than $830 billion in early January.   “While the softer prices of crypto assets does create a more difficult environment for investors, I do not think it will pause the influx of funds and other financial institutions building products in the space,” Autonomous NEXT partner Lex Sokolin said.  “It would take the extreme case of the entire space contracting by 80 percent and high regulation before the flow of funds turns around.”  Cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds lost an average of 4.6 percent in January, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge.   That compares with an average 8.25 percent return across all hedge funds tracked by Eurekahedge.   Some invest in just bitcoin, taking both long and short positions, some buy a basket of cryptocurrencies and others exploit the arbitrage between different exchanges’ prices.  The funds tracked by Eurekahedge, which account for close to $1 billion in assets, made an average of 1,477.85 percent in 2017, Eurekahedge said.   “Gains in 2017 were largely generated from being long,” said Diana Gibson, a managing director at investment consultant Cambridge Associates, referring to crypto hedge funds in general.    All of Eurekahedge’s nine index constituents lost money in January, as they also did during another dip in the price of bitcoin in September.   But other hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies have managed to sidestep bitcoin downturns by using different strategies.   Token Capital’s $500 million EKT Active Fund, which invests in so-called initial coin offerings - digital token-based fundraising - both pre- and post-launch, made 6.5 percent in January, a spokesman for Token Capital said.  BitSpread, a Cayman-registered hedge fund, returned around 4.8 percent. BitSpread, with more than $100 million under management, makes money by market-making and exploiting arbitrage across different exchanges rather than going long or short.   BitSpread’s founder Cedric Jeanson said the fund’s market-neutral strategy meant it could make money even if the price of bitcoin and its rivals collapsed. It has made money in every month that it has been running since its launch in May 2017.  Jeanson said some of the hedge funds charge high fees - an average of 1.6 percent for management and 17.5 percent for performance for funds tracked by Eurekahedge - even though they are using largely passive strategies.   “If you’re paying an investment manager, they have to have to provide some kind of alpha; and there has to be a consistent return,” said Jeanson, from his base in Singapore.

The first bitcoin future trades kicked off on Sunday at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) on CBOE Global Markets Inc’s CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE).  Interactive Brokers said it offers bitcoin futures under the ticker symbol “GXBT” on the CFE and plans to offer the same on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) from Dec. 18, a day after the exchange launches its own futures contract.  Interactive Brokers said its all-in commission rate, including exchange and regulatory fees, for bitcoin futures will be $5.01 per contract for the CBOE product and $15.01 per contract for the CME product.  But Interactive Brokers said that due to the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies, clients would be unable to take a short position and that only limit orders would be accepted.  The company said that as of 9:15 a.m. ET on Monday, 201 of its accounts had placed 1,240 trades in bitcoin futures, totaling 1,429 contracts.  The one-month bitcoin contract on the CFE opened at 6 p.m. local time (2300 GMT) on Sunday at $15,460, dipped briefly before rising to a high of $18,700 and then slipping again.  By 1459 GMT on Monday, nearly 16 hours after it had began trading, the one-month future contract was trading at $17,820, just 10 percent above bitcoin’s “spot” price - the price at which it is currently changing hands - of $16,190 on the Bitstamp exchange.

260,INSIGHT-Bitcoin fever exposes crypto-market frailties,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1O30O4,"December 13, 2017 10:38am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As bitcoin raced to another record high on Tuesday, one of the biggest providers of digital currency wallets, Coinbase, went down under the weight of traffic, leaving many of its more than 10 million customers unable to access their funds.      At the same time, Bitfinex, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, said it was under a heavy denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, meaning its servers had been intentionally flooded with junk online requests, taking down its website and crippling its services.  The latest outages show how the market infrastructure for an immature and volatile instrument that millions of investors have piled into may be ill-equipped to cope with sudden shifts in demand, which is worrying some investors.  During a particularly volatile period of trading on Dec. 7, bitcoin surged from below $16,000 to $19,500 in less than an hour on Coinbase’s exchange GDAX, while it was changing hands at less than $16,000 on another, Bitstamp.   As trading volume surged, GDAX and Coinbase went down at least 10 times because of “record-high traffic”, Coinbase said.      “More people are engaging with our platform than ever and that bodes well for the future of the digital currency. At the same time, it does create extreme volatility and stress on our systems,” the company’s director of business operations, David Farmer, said.      “We can confirm that there has been no unusual or suspicious activity. All we know right now is that there is a large amount of traffic,” he told Reuters.   Bitfinex said it had been under a sustained DDoS attack since last week.   “While last week the platform traded continuously, to effectively perform emergency maintenance, we took the website down for a brief time today (Tuesday) to mitigate further issues for customers,” a spokesman said.   “We are constantly improving our systems to ensure that we’re able to both accommodate the immense volume of trading that occurs on our platform while also fending off sustained DDoS attacks,” he said.  Daniel Masters, founder of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, worries the exchanges would struggle to cope if there were a sudden rush for the exit.   “The ability of these platforms to handle volume is yet to be tested properly,” he said. “What happens if this market turns into a lot of sellers? The liquidity itself could be an issue.”  Charles Cascarilla, chief executive of New York-based company Paxos, which operates cryptocurrency exchange itBit, told Reuters that dealing with spikes in volume was a problem faced by all exchanges, not just cryptocurrency platforms.       “Clearly the reality is the world of cryptocurrency is growing at an exponential rate right now and everyone is doing their best to expand infrastructure, but it is hard to know what would happen in a hypothetical scenario,” he said.  Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini exchange, an early bitcoin investor and an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency, said the risk the wider market would suffer badly if one exchange went down no longer existed, as trading volume had become more evenly spread.  “We are definitely beyond the too-big-to-fail situation,” he told Reuters. “That was a problem we had five years ago when Mt. Gox accounted for 95 percent of volume.”  “Most of the exchanges are doing a good job. This is a 24/7 market, there is no session close and there is no downtime.”  Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole 650,000 bitcoins, triggering a collapse in the bitcoin price.  The demise of Mt. Gox left more than 24,000 customers unable to access hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency and cash. More than three years later none has recouped a cent.  Some investors had said they were worried the launch of bitcoin futures by the world’s biggest derivative exchanges could exacerbate volatility by prompting some traders to take out large positions betting on a price fall in the future.       The Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. futures launched a futures contracts on bitcoin on Dec. 10 and CME Group Inc will launch a rival contract a week later.    So far this week, the launch of futures by Cboe does not appear to have created any additional volatility, with price moves less violent than last week’s wild trading.      But Tim Swanson, a bitcoin expert and founder of Post Oak Labs, a technology advisory firm, said he was concerned that if the futures liquidity increases there could be an incentive for someone with a large bet against bitcoin to disrupt or attack the network to make money from the ensuing price fall.       CME Group and Cboe declined to comment.       Flooding the bitcoin network with tiny transactions could potentially send the price down sharply, said Swanson, as could sending many sell-signals to the market that are not honoured - so-called spoofing, which is illegal in regulated markets.      A surge in bitcoin trades in recent weeks has also left the blockchain network that the cryptocurrency relies on to process and verify transactions struggling to keep up.  As of Wednesday at 1445 GMT, more than 125,000 bitcoin transactions remained unconfirmed.  In the past week, more than half a million new users have opened wallets with retail-focused bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, the firm said, taking the total number of users to more than 20 million, from 10 million last year.      The London-based company has also been struggling to keep up, citing “record traffic levels” last week.    Created in 2008, bitcoin uses encryption and a shared blockchain database that enables the anonymous transfer of funds outside of a conventional centralised payment system.      But there is little evidence to suggest buyers are using bitcoin as a means of exchange and payment. On the whole, they buy the cryptocurrency as a speculative investment, attracted by massive price gains, said Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School.  As a result, some banks say they are worried that a collapse in bitcoin would have a knock-on effect on investments by individual investors in other asset classes.    Deutsche Bank said in a report on Dec. 7 that a bitcoin crash - and the impact it could have on retail investors’ confidence - was one of the biggest risks to markets in 2018.  Periods of high volatility are not uncommon in other currencies and asset classes, particularly in commodities and emerging markets. But bitcoin’s volatility is extreme, and frequent: the one-day price move has been more than 10 percent on nine days in the past three months.  Moves of a similar magnitude for the U.S dollar, for example, are extremely rare. Its biggest one-day move against a major currency was in January 2015 when the Swiss central bank abandoned a cap on the franc, sending the dollar down 18 percent.  Some bitcoin watchers, such as Swanson, also worry about the risk of one of the big exchanges being suddenly shut by authorities.  In July, U.S. authorities shut down the website of the BTC-e exchange, saying it had “facilitated transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking”.   BTC-e, which is no longer operating, could not be reached for comment.  The top three exchanges out of more than 100 - Bitfinex, GDAX and bitFlyer - are home to more than 60 percent of all trading, according to data provider Bitcoinity.      Another issue specific to the market is the risk of hacking and theft. More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, Reuters has found, with the Mt. Gox heist accounting for the majority.   Last week, a Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace, NiceHash, said it had lost about $64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system.

262,Bitcoin fever exposes crypto-market frailties,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E724X,"December 14, 2017 06:14am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As bitcoin raced to another record high on Tuesday, one of the biggest providers of digital currency wallets, Coinbase, went down under the weight of traffic, leaving many of its more than 10 million customers unable to access their funds.      At the same time, Bitfinex, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, said it was under a heavy denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, meaning its servers had been intentionally flooded with junk online requests, taking down its website and crippling its services.  The latest outages show how the market infrastructure for an immature and volatile instrument that millions of investors have piled into may be ill-equipped to cope with sudden shifts in demand, which is worrying some investors.  During a particularly volatile period of trading on Dec. 7, bitcoin surged from below $16,000 to $19,500 in less than an hour on Coinbase’s exchange GDAX, while it was changing hands at less than $16,000 on another, Bitstamp.   As trading volume surged, GDAX and Coinbase went down at least 10 times because of “record-high traffic”, Coinbase said.      “More people are engaging with our platform than ever and that bodes well for the future of the digital currency. At the same time, it does create extreme volatility and stress on our systems,” the company’s director of business operations, David Farmer, said.      “We can confirm that there has been no unusual or suspicious activity. All we know right now is that there is a large amount of traffic,” he told Reuters.   Bitfinex said it had been under a sustained DDoS attack since last week.   “While last week the platform traded continuously, to effectively perform emergency maintenance, we took the website down for a brief time today (Tuesday) to mitigate further issues for customers,” a spokesman said.   “We are constantly improving our systems to ensure that we’re able to both accommodate the immense volume of trading that occurs on our platform while also fending off sustained DDoS attacks,” he said.  Daniel Masters, founder of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, worries the exchanges would struggle to cope if there were a sudden rush for the exit.   “The ability of these platforms to handle volume is yet to be tested properly,” he said. “What happens if this market turns into a lot of sellers? The liquidity itself could be an issue.”  Charles Cascarilla, chief executive of New York-based company Paxos, which operates cryptocurrency exchange itBit, told Reuters that dealing with spikes in volume was a problem faced by all exchanges, not just cryptocurrency platforms.       “Clearly the reality is the world of cryptocurrency is growing at an exponential rate right now and everyone is doing their best to expand infrastructure, but it is hard to know what would happen in a hypothetical scenario,” he said.  Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini exchange, an early bitcoin investor and an outspoken supporter of the cryptocurrency, said the risk the wider market would suffer badly if one exchange went down no longer existed, as trading volume had become more evenly spread.  “We are definitely beyond the too-big-to-fail situation,” he told Reuters. “That was a problem we had five years ago when Mt. Gox accounted for 95 percent of volume.”  “Most of the exchanges are doing a good job. This is a 24/7 market, there is no session close and there is no downtime.”  Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole 650,000 bitcoins, triggering a collapse in the bitcoin price.  The demise of Mt. Gox left more than 24,000 customers unable to access hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency and cash. More than three years later none has recouped a cent.  Some investors had said they were worried the launch of bitcoin futures by the world’s biggest derivative exchanges could exacerbate volatility by prompting some traders to take out large positions betting on a price fall in the future.       The Chicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. futures launched a futures contracts on bitcoin on Dec. 10 and CME Group Inc will launch a rival contract a week later.    So far this week, the launch of futures by Cboe does not appear to have created any additional volatility, with price moves less violent than last week’s wild trading.      But Tim Swanson, a bitcoin expert and founder of Post Oak Labs, a technology advisory firm, said he was concerned that if the futures liquidity increases there could be an incentive for someone with a large bet against bitcoin to disrupt or attack the network to make money from the ensuing price fall.       CME Group and Cboe declined to comment.       Flooding the bitcoin network with tiny transactions could potentially send the price down sharply, said Swanson, as could sending many sell-signals to the market that are not honoured - so-called spoofing, which is illegal in regulated markets.      A surge in bitcoin trades in recent weeks has also left the blockchain network that the cryptocurrency relies on to process and verify transactions struggling to keep up.  As of Wednesday at 1445 GMT, more than 125,000 bitcoin transactions remained unconfirmed.  In the past week, more than half a million new users have opened wallets with retail-focused bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, the firm said, taking the total number of users to more than 20 million, from 10 million last year.      The London-based company has also been struggling to keep up, citing “record traffic levels” last week.    Created in 2008, bitcoin uses encryption and a shared blockchain database that enables the anonymous transfer of funds outside of a conventional centralised payment system.      But there is little evidence to suggest buyers are using bitcoin as a means of exchange and payment. On the whole, they buy the cryptocurrency as a speculative investment, attracted by massive price gains, said Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge’s Judge Business School.  As a result, some banks say they are worried that a collapse in bitcoin would have a knock-on effect on investments by individual investors in other asset classes.    Deutsche Bank said in a report on Dec. 7 that a bitcoin crash - and the impact it could have on retail investors’ confidence - was one of the biggest risks to markets in 2018.  Periods of high volatility are not uncommon in other currencies and asset classes, particularly in commodities and emerging markets. But bitcoin’s volatility is extreme, and frequent: the one-day price move has been more than 10 percent on nine days in the past three months.  Moves of a similar magnitude for the U.S dollar, for example, are extremely rare. Its biggest one-day move against a major currency was in January 2015 when the Swiss central bank abandoned a cap on the franc, sending the dollar down 18 percent.  Some bitcoin watchers, such as Swanson, also worry about the risk of one of the big exchanges being suddenly shut by authorities.  In July, U.S. authorities shut down the website of the BTC-e exchange, saying it had “facilitated transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking”.   BTC-e, which is no longer operating, could not be reached for comment.  The top three exchanges out of more than 100 - Bitfinex, GDAX and bitFlyer - are home to more than 60 percent of all trading, according to data provider Bitcoinity.      Another issue specific to the market is the risk of hacking and theft. More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, Reuters has found, with the Mt. Gox heist accounting for the majority.   Last week, a Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace, NiceHash, said it had lost about $64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system.

264,"Fascination with bitcoin a ""speculative mania"" - RBA governor",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSS9N1LO024,"December 12, 2017 05:15pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The fascination with virtual currencies feels more like a “speculative mania”, the head of Australia’s central bank said on Wednesday, just days after the launch of the world’s first  bitcoin futures.  Cryptocurrency bitcoin surged past $17,000 on Tuesday to an all-time high, two days after futures trading began on Chicago-based derivatives exchange CBOE Global Markets. Investors have grown optimistic that the $20,000-mark is now within reach.  But Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe listed the difficulties of using bitcoins in everyday payments.  “When thought of purely as a payment instrument, it seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions,” Lowe said in the speech titled “An eAUD?”  “The value of bitcoin is very volatile, the number of payments that can currently be handled is very low, there are governance problems, the transaction cost involved in making a payment with Bitcoin is very high and the estimates of the electricity used in the process of mining the coins are staggering.”  The RBA itself is open to the idea of issuing a new form of digital money, perhaps using distributed ledger technology on which bitcoins function, but the case for doing that has not yet been established, Lowe added.  The RBA also has no immediate plans to issue an electronic form of Australian dollar banknotes, or eAUDs, but it is looking at how settlement arrangements with central bank money might evolve.  While a privately issued eAUD is conceivable, history showed there were “significant difficulties and dangers” associated with privately issued fiat money, Lowe said.  “The history of private issuance is one of periodic panic and instability,” he added.  “In times of uncertainty and stress, people don’t want to hold privately issued fiat money. This is one reason why today physical banknotes are backed by central banks.”  The RBA is in close contact with its peers in other countries on introducing electronic banknotes and few see them on the horizon, Lowe said.

265,"GRAPHIC-Bitcoin's blistering rally tops $10,000 mark",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1NZ008,"November 28, 2017 11:02pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Red-hot bitcoin soared through an all-time high above $10,000 on Wednesday, taking its gains to more than 900 percent so far this year, the most of any asset class.  Despite widespread scepticism of many veteran bankers and fund managers, it is being propelled by a continued influx of retail buyers as well as promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional investors, analysts said.  Created in 2009, bitcoin tracks the ideas set out in a whitepaper by an individual or group of individuals called Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be revealed. It promises lower transaction fees than traditional online payment systems and is not regulated by any government or entity.  Enthusiasts and supporters for bitcoin are attracted by its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. But the risks of dealing in bitcoin were exposed in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange MtGox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.  Bitcoin is a far cry from those early beginnings.  The $10,000 level is a key turning point for this digital asset and a critical moment for the crypto-currency space in general.  “Investors will be looking to take profits and re-evaluate their positions.There will be some churn as overweight bitcoiners wash into other cryptos searching for yield,” said Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive officer of CryptoCompare, an interactive crypto-currency platform.  Bitcoin took 834 days to top $1,000 from the time that BitStamp started to track the price in August 2011. It was another 1,270 days to hit $2,000 on May 20, 2017. However, the price has surged in the later half of 2017, crossing successive $1,000 milestones with ever increasing speed on its march toward $10,000.  As bitcoin soars, the virtual currency market now has market capitalization — its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system — of more than $300 billion. Bitcoin accounts for more than 50 percent of that market cap.  Bitcoin’s volatility versus other asset markets shows a sharp divergence, with more frequent peaks and sharp declines over the last two years.

Here are some of the differences between the products offered by the Chicago-based exchange operators.   -The Cboe Bitcoin Futures Contract uses the ticker XBT and equals one bitcoin.  -The CME Bitcoin Futures Contract will use the ticker BTC and will equal five bitcoins.  -Both Cboe’s and CME’s bitcoin futures contracts will be settled in U.S. dollars, allowing exposure to the bitcoin without actually having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.   -Cboe’s contract is priced off of a single auction at 4 p.m. Eastern time (2100 GMT) on the final settlement date on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.  -CME’s contract will be priced off of the CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, an index that references pricing data from cryptocurrency exchanges, currently made up of Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.      -Cboe’s XBT contract trades on CFE, with regular trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Eastern time on Mondays and 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m Tuesday through Friday. Extended hours will be 6 p.m. Sunday to 9:30 a.m. Monday, and 4:30 p.m. Monday through to 9:30 a.m. Friday.      -CME’s BTC will trade on CME Globex from Sunday to Friday from 6 p.m. - 5 p.m. Eastern time with a one-hour break each day beginning at 5 p.m.  -Cboe’s contract clears through the Options Clearing Corporation and an initial margin of 44 percent and a maintenance margin of 40 percent applies.  -CME’s contract will clear through CME ClearPort and will have a 43 percent initial margin rate and a maintenance rate of 43 percent.  -Margin rates at both exchanges are subject to change.  -Cboe said it may list up to four weekly contracts, three near-term serial months, and three months on the March quarterly cycle.  -CME said it will list monthly contracts for the nearest two months in the March quarterly cycle (March, June, Sept., Dec.) plus the nearest two serial months not in the March quarterly cycle.  -Cboe will halt trading in its contract for 2 minutes if the best bid in the XBT futures contract closest to expiration is 10 percent or more above or below the daily settlement price of that contract on the prior business day.

Enthusiasts and supporters for bitcoin are attracted by its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control.

The use of bitcoin for remitting money to the Philippines, one of the world’s biggest recipients of cash sent home by its citizens working abroad, has risen dramatically, prompting the central bank to issue guidelines for VC exchanges.  A VC exchange is an entity that facilitates the conversion or exchange of fiat currency to virtual currency, or vice versa.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is seeking to regulate the industry, which it says is open to misuse.  “We do not endorse virtual currency as a currency because it is not a currency,” Melchor Plabasan, deputy director and head of the BSP’s Core Information Technology Specialist Group, told a news conference.  “We only regulate bitcoin or virtual currencies when it is used in delivering financial services like remittance and payments,” he said, reiterating a warning that such currencies can be used in money laundering and terrorist financing.  Monthly transactions in the Philippines involving mostly bitcoin averaged $8.8 million in the first half of 2017, from only $2 million in 2015 and about $6 million in 2016, data from the central bank showed.  The central bank and a legislator have also cautioned Filipinos against investing in bitcoin in the absence of regulatory protections for them.  Bitcoin’s value has jumped more than 16-fold this year to above $17,000.  The BSP issued early this year a circular setting out guidelines for VC exchanges, having issued licences to two firms, Rebittance Inc and Betur, which provide remittance services.  These exchanges, which are locally-incorporated but majority-owned by foreign investors, are now required to comply with the BSP’s regulations covering remittance firms, including reporting transactions on a regular basis, Plabasan said.  Plabasan also said the BSP was preparing to issue a public advisory on “how they can protect their bitcoin wallet.”  “There are a lot of pyramid schemes right now disguised as ICOs (initial coin offerings) for investment channels,” he said.  “We will advise the general public to be wary of these types of institutions...and they should only deal with those that are registered with the BSP, “ he said.

Tokyo has officially recognised bitcoin and crypto-currency exchanges, and Seoul is mulling the same. Such regulation is an effort to contain risk but also encourages acceptance and increases the allure of this untouchable cash.   	The price of bitcoin, the most well-known and largest digital currency, has surged 1,556 percent this year to top $16,522. Financial institutions remain wary of bitcoin’s wild swings but there is explosive demand from stay-at-home retail traders in Japan and South Korea: yen and won-based trading account for 51 percent of the global total, estimates Coinhills.   	Exchanges which let users buy, sell and store digital money are booming. Seoul-based Bithumb, for instance, is one of the world’s busiest platforms, shifting almost $5 billion of trades a day, according to CoinMarketCap.  	Yet globally most exchanges are unregulated, offer few investor protections, and are frequently targeted by thieves. On Tuesday, a South Korean exchange collapsed after it admitted being hacked. China’s central bank shut down digital currency houses this year on concerns over fraud, money laundering and capital flight. In the United States, only some states like New York require licences for businesses involved with crypto-currencies.  	Bureaucrats in Tokyo and Seoul, by contrast, are legitimising virtual trading. Japan in April allowed crypto-currencies as a means of settlement. Digital currency outfits there must conduct annual audits, meet capital requirements and enforce anti-money laundering measures. South Korea is now considering similar legislation; it is also proposing a capital gains tax, following Japan’s move to impose one in September. Satsuki Katayama, a lawmaker from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told a Breakingviews Predictions event in Tokyo she welcomed market oversight from Japan’s Financial Services Agency.  	These measures could have unintended consequences. The crackdown in China pushed trading to more insecure peer-to-peer marketplaces and messaging apps. Japan’s new laws probably fuelled more speculation: trading at major Japanese exchanges has surged since April. In the effort to contain risks, Asian authorities are fanning the flames.

282,Japan to regulate and tax Bitcoin trades: Nikkei,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA231Y420140304,"March 04, 2014 02:14pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - The Japanese government will set rules for trading bitcoin, including imposing taxes on transactions with the virtual currency, that will become the basis for guidelines applicable to similar currencies in future, the Nikkei reported.  Japan’s government is still trying to explain the collapse of Mt. Gox - once the world’s once largest bitcoin exchange - and figure out how the Tokyo-based company could lose nearly half a billion dollars in bitcoins, Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday.  Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, saying it may have lost some 850,000 bitcoins due to hacking into its faulty computer system.  The guidelines proposed by the Japanese cabinet will call for taxing bitcoin transactions, defining the virtual currency as a commodity rather than a currency, the Nikkei said.  Gains from trading bitcoins on online exchanges, purchases made with bitcoins, and companies earning revenue from bitcoin transactions will be subject to Japanese tax, the financial newspaper said.  Banks will be also be prohibited from handling bitcoins while securities firms will be barred from brokering bitcoin trades, the Nikkei reported.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional money, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value has soared in the last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion.  The virtual currency has engendered a new wave of creative criminality from hacking online platforms to steal bitcoins to their potential for use in money laundering, bribery and purchases of illicit products.  Last week, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the U.S. Congress should look into legal options for regulating virtual currencies such as bitcoin.  Shanghai-based BTC China, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, has imposed new regulations to curb bitcoin trade weeks after Beijing banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin due to the risks involved.  Russian authorities have issued warnings against using bitcoin, saying treating it as a parallel currency is illegal.  Britain, however, has supported bitcoin and is preparing to abort its plans to tax bitcoin trading, according to a Financial Times report.

Such regulation is an effort to contain risk but also encourages acceptance and increases the allure of this untouchable cash.   	The price of bitcoin, the most well-known and largest digital currency, has surged 1,556 percent this year to top $16,522. Financial institutions remain wary of bitcoin’s wild swings but there is explosive demand from stay-at-home retail traders in Japan and South Korea: yen and won-based trading account for 51 percent of the global total, estimates Coinhills.   	Exchanges which let users buy, sell and store digital money are booming. Seoul-based Bithumb, for instance, is one of the world’s busiest platforms, shifting almost $5 billion of trades a day, according to CoinMarketCap.  	Yet globally most exchanges are unregulated, offer few investor protections, and are frequently targeted by thieves. On Tuesday, a South Korean exchange collapsed after it admitted being hacked. China’s central bank shut down digital currency houses this year on concerns over fraud, money laundering and capital flight. In the United States, only some states like New York require licences for businesses involved with crypto-currencies.  	Bureaucrats in Tokyo and Seoul, by contrast, are legitimising virtual trading. Japan in April allowed crypto-currencies as a means of settlement. Digital currency outfits there must conduct annual audits, meet capital requirements and enforce anti-money laundering measures. South Korea is now considering similar legislation; it is also proposing a capital gains tax, following Japan’s move to impose one in September. Satsuki Katayama, a lawmaker from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told a Breakingviews Predictions event in Tokyo she welcomed market oversight from Japan’s Financial Services Agency.  	These measures could have unintended consequences. The crackdown in China pushed trading to more insecure peer-to-peer marketplaces and messaging apps. Japan’s new laws probably fuelled more speculation: trading at major Japanese exchanges has surged since April. In the effort to contain risks, Asian authorities are fanning the flames.

285,"Bitcoin splits, but clone off to slow start",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1AH5F1,"August 02, 2017 08:57am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s underlying software code was split on Tuesday, generating a new clone called “Bitcoin Cash,” but the new virtual currency got off to a slow start due to lackluster support for its network.  The initiative was headed by a small group of mostly China-based bitcoin miners - programmers who essentially operate the bitcoin network - who were not happy with scheduled improvements to the currency’s technology meant to increase its capacity to process transactions.  These miners, who get paid in the currency for contributing computing power to the bitcoin network, initiated what is known as a “fork” on Tuesday, where the underlying blockchain splits into two potential paths, creating a new digital currency.   The blockchain is a shared online ledger of all bitcoin transactions and has spawned a range of financial and business applications.  Bitcoin’s split has created a new competitor to the original digital currency, which remains the oldest and most valuable in circulation.  Yet only a small fraction of bitcoin miners have been contributing their computing power to the new blockchain, and it took nearly six hours for the first batch of Bitcoin Cash coins to be mined this afternoon, according to Blockdozer Explorer, a firm providing data on digital currencies.  “It’s been a slow start for Bitcoin Cash,” said Iqbal Gandham, managing director at trading platform eToro. “The delay ... could be a result of a lack of miner support for the new cryptocurrency.”  Bitcoin Cash on Tuesday traded on certain exchanges at a median price of $146.37, according to bitinfocharts.com, while bitcoin was at $2,729 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, down 4.6 percent from Monday.   After the split, Bitcoin Cash has all the history from bitcoin’s blockchain, creating the same number of tokens, plus the new currency created. People who held bitcoins before the split now have access to an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash for free, which they will then be able to trade for fiat currencies - legal tender such as euros and dollars - or other digital tokens.  The creation of new tokens may speed up as less computing power will be required to mine new blocks, said Jeff Garzik, co-founder of blockchain startup, in an email.   Ryan Taylor, chief executive of Dash Core, a firm that manages the development of the Dash digital currency, said Bitcoin Cash may yet be short-lived.   “Bitcoin Cash has not solved scaling,” Dash said. “It has merely kicked the can down the road with slightly larger blocks, but still lacks a credible technology to scale to massively larger numbers of users.”  Reporting by Anna Irrera and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Bill Rigby",0.20319333333333336,0.00796997755331088

On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin fell as low as $6,853.53 in early afternoon trading in New York. That marked a fall of more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 hit in December.  Bitcoin has fallen in six of the last eight trading session.  The currency, which surged more than 1,300 percent last year, has lost about half its value so far in 2018, as more governments and banks signal their intention for a regulatory crackdown. Last week bitcoin suffered its worst weekly performance since 2013.  “We envisage this decline will continue, setting the next technical level at $5,000 a coin,” said Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, which specializes in foreign exchange, worldwide payments and treasury management.  Other cryptocurrencies also suffered double-digit declines on Monday, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com.  Ethereum, the second largest virtual currency, was last down nearly 19 percent at $703.40, while Ripple, the third largest, last traded at 71 cents, down 14.1 percent.  British bank Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) said on Sunday it was banning customers from using credit cards to buy bitcoin. It joined U.S. banking giants JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), which announced similar bans on concerns the lenders could be held liable when the volatile currencies plunge in value. [nL8N1PU10Y]  On Monday, India said it was planning steps to make virtual currencies illegal within its payments system and to regulate the trading of crypto assets.  “Cryptocurrencies have seriously fallen out of favor since the middle of December, and constant negative news flow and speculation of increased regulation has exacerbated the move lower,” Craig Erlam, an analyst at currency broker Oanda, said.  The cryptocurrency sector has also attracted the spotlight after news of hacks and scams, including the roughly 58 billion yen ($532.9 million) stolen in digital money from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck two weeks ago. nL8N1PP6W8[]   But some investors were unfazed.  “Bitcoin has bounced back from similar collapses before during its short but volatile history, and it would hardly be a shock if those claiming the bubble has burst are surprised by yet another change in fortunes,” said Dennis de Jong, managing director at online FX brokerage firm UFX.com in Limassol, Cyprus.

Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. Their value depends on people’s confidence in the currency.  It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but have yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com .  The Bank of France said the price of bitcoin in legal currencies was inherently volatile and users may find it difficult to convert to real money.  The anonymity that bitcoin offer users also raises the risk that they could also be used for money-laundering and financing of terrorism, the central bank said in a publication.  “Even if bitcoin is not currently a credible investment vehicle and therefore do not pose a significant risk to financial stability, they represent a financial risk for those who hold them,” the Bank of France said.  Though the central bank saw no threat to its monopoly on the issuance of legal tender, bitcoin’s growing popularity has increasingly attracted the attention of authorities in several countries, including China and the United States.  The Chinese central bank warned financial institutions on Thursday against trading bitcoin, which has proven particularly popular in China.  The price of the digital currency rose over $1,000 last month for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble in the making.  The Bank of France warned that speculating on the price of bitcoin could become costly if other users became unwilling to convert gains into legal tender, potentially putting the whole system at risk of collapse if bitcoin demand evaporated.  Noting a growing number of retailers and service providers who accept bitcoin for payment in France, the central bank warned they benefited from no guarantee that the bitcoin could be cashed for real money.

288,Factbox: What is bitcoin and how does it work?,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1O21M20140225,"February 25, 2014 06:47pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, abruptly stopped trading on Tuesday, shaking investor confidence in the digital currency that is struggling for legitimacy.  A form of electronic money independent of traditional banking, bitcoins started circulating in 2009 and have become the most prominent of several fledgling digital currencies.  The virtual currency relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made.  Unlike traditional currencies, where a central bank decides how much money to print based on goals like controlling inflation, no central authority governs the supply of bitcoins. Like other commodities and currencies, its value depends on people’s confidence in it.  The dollar price of bitcoins quoted on online exchange Bitstamp spiked from around $30 a year ago to more than $1,100 in December as more people became aware of the currency and speculators jumped into the highly volatile market. But growing attention from regulators and concerns that bitcoins could be more susceptible to fraud than previously thought have sparked a steady decline in prices, to around $530 on Tuesday.  Compounding the issue, its price can vary greatly depending on the exchange.  Proponents say bitcoins could one day become widely used by consumers for online shopping and other electronic transactions. Certain online retailers such as Overstock.com and physical stores, mostly smaller operations, already accept the digital currency, but its adoption is not widespread.  Critics say bitcoin is too volatile to be widely adopted and warn of its lack of regulation and its use to pay for illegal drugs and other nefarious transactions.  Bitcoins are held in virtual wallets with unique keys. Transactions are made by sending bitcoins from one wallet to a unique key associated with another wallet in a cryptographic process that is verified by computers across the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin wallets can be stored offline or online at exchanges like Bitstamp and BTC-E.  The system was designed to reward computers that do the crucial work of verifying transactions with the occasional payoff of new bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin mining.  The growth in the virtual currency’s value has created a market for souped-up computers and chips especially designed for the cryptographic calculations used in bitcoin.  About 12.4 million bitcoins, worth $6.2 billion at recent prices, have been minted since the currency began circulating, according to Blockchain.info.  The Tokyo-based bourse halted withdrawals earlier this month after detecting “unusual activity”, and on Tuesday it abruptly stopped trading. An unverified document circulating on the Internet purporting to be a crisis plan for Mt. Gox said more than 744,000 bitcoins were “missing due to malleability-related theft.”  Mt. Gox began as a website for exchanging trading cards before turning to bitcoin.  Bitcoin critics say Mt. Gox’s apparent failure proves the unregulated currency is far from ready for widespread use. They also point to hacking attacks at other exchanges.  But proponents say it’s early days for virtual currencies and note that newer bitcoin exchanges and other startups aiming to make bitcoin mainstream are supervised by seasoned venture capitalists and financial experts.  Many bitcoin advocates still hold out the hope of creating a digital currency system free of government intervention or control.

Slovenia-based Bitstamp, among the largest bitcoin exchanges, said on its website that developers had come up with a solution to thwart the cyber attacks against its platform that had forced the hiatus. It suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, days after one of the best known exchanges, Mt. Gox, suspended withdrawals indefinitely.  “After additional testing, we plan to enable bitcoin withdrawals later today,” Bitstamp’s statement said.  Mt. Gox has not yet resumed withdrawals and has not issued a public update on the matter since Monday.  Bitcoin prices continued their pattern of volatile trading on Friday, and prices varied widely by exchange. On Mt. Gox, where trading has continued despite the withdrawal suspension, the price plunged to as low as $302 early on Friday, but recovered later in the day following the Bitstamp announcement, last trading at $443, down about 7.5 percent from Thursday.  “The news that Bitstamp is resuming withdrawals restored some confidence and prompted people to buy back bitcoin,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. “The fear trade seems to have dissipated.”  At CoinDesk, which this week excluded Mt. Gox data from its Bitcoin Price Index, the currency’s price was substantially higher. There, bitcoin was quoted at $647.12, up more than 8 percent on the day.  Adding to the choppiness were reports that the online drugs marketplace Silk Road 2 had been hacked and drained of about $2.7 million worth of the digital currency. CNN said the site’s administrator posted the news late on Thursday.  The first Silk Road site, which like its successor was accessible only using a special program that hides users’ physical locations, was shut down last year by U.S. law enforcement authorities, and the man authorities say was behind its operations was arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking and money laundering.  “There should be no impact on bitcoin prices based on the reduction of illegal activity,” said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. “It really indicates that there’s nervousness in the market.”  Galy said seasoned traders likely bought bitcoin after its price dropped.  “Professional traders would recognize that there is overselling based on irrational fears,” he said.",-0.11222380952380953,0.05139424697247826

For the most part though, institutional investors have stayed away from bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the original and largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, despite outperforming all the world's traditional currencies.  But Square, best known for its technology that allows merchants to process credit card transactions without a cash register or expensive system, says its customers have shown an appetite for the “alt-currency.”  “We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy bitcoin,” a company spokesperson said.  “We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we’re excited to learn more here,” Square said.  Traditional investors still view bitcoin as opaque and highly speculative with potential to collapse. The currency’s legitimacy has often been called into question because of its association with Silk Road, an online black market for illegal drugs.  China has already forced several bitcoin exchanges to close down, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has called cryptocurrency a “fraud”.  None of that has deterred investors who continue to buy bitcoins, and that had attracted the attention of U.S. exchange operators.  CME Group Inc (CME.O), the world’s largest derivatives exchange operator, said last month it will launch a futures contract for bitcoin later this year.  Rival Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.O is awaiting regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange traded fund they announced earlier this year.  Major financial firms will soon start to offer bitcoin or similar products as an investment option, with a turning-point product about six months away, Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies said earlier this week.  Square did not say when it started rolling out the feature to customers or when it plans to make it available to all its customers.  Square’s shares were up 1.8 percent at $40.44, easing after hitting a record high of $41.80. Bitcoin was up about 8 percent at $7,150.

The CME Group plans to start trading futures in the crypto-currency, treating it like a genuine asset with a vaguely predictable value. Devotees are delighted, and critics, like me, look foolish. I predicted imminent collapse back in 2013 when the price was $87. On Wednesday, it hit $10,000.  We doubters have to decide between surrender and struggle. I choose the latter. Bitcoin and its many electronic rivals suffer from numerous incurable flaws – economic, social and cultural.  The biggest economic weakness is not in the underlying blockchain technology, although tales of hacking and lost tokens suggest there are serious kinks to work out. Nor is the main problem the high energy usage involved in creating new coins, although it is alarming.  There’s a more fundamental economic confusion to consider. As a currency, these electronic tokens simply cannot have both of the advantages backers ascribe to them. If they are collectible items, which are expected to rise in value, they cannot also be attractive alternatives to government-regulated mediums of exchange.  After all, when owners of assets think their property will become more valuable, they do not sell. Thus bitcoins can be expected to be hoarded as long as the price keeps rising. And when the market turns, then no law-abiding merchant will be willing to accept them. They do not have to, because there is a great alternative: traditional currencies. Not only does legal tender come with low transaction costs, these monies only lose value at the very slow pace of inflation.  If bitcoin buyers were serious about its potential functionality, they would be devastated by the recent vertiginous price increases – a doubling in three months. After so much volatility, it would take years of price stability for legitimate merchants to take it seriously as a currency.  If that were not enough, bitcoin and its ilk have another fatal economic problem. They are not trustworthy. Even without the numerous breathless websites covering the ever-increasing supply of crypto-currencies, a bunch of mutually suspicious computer nerds who keep tinkering with the formula just cannot inspire confidence.  Again, the alternative is much better. In the world of government-supported money, hyperinflation is extraordinarily rare. And while bank failures that end with write-downs of account balances happen, hacks and other losses of crypto-currencies are far more frequent. Even the 2008 financial crisis, which was a terrible moment for bank-created money, ended with almost no losses for ordinary savers.  One thing that blinds many crypto-currency backers to economic reality is libertarianism. Government-haters believe any temporary problems with private currencies are worth enduring, since they will free societies from the yoke of the state’s monetary oppression.  A variety of that argument clearly works for criminals. It is not an accident that the most regular use of bitcoin is for illegal activities. The logic is simple and persuasive. While movements of the unregulated electronic tokens are much more expensive and less secure than bank transfers, they come with a lower risk of prison terms.  “Bitcoin, the outlaw’s friend” is not much of a slogan. Enthusiasts are undaunted, however. When their reasoning is not merely vacuous – it will work because it is such a good idea – it is frequently apocalyptic. They believe that the end is near for our whole corrupt and violently polarised culture. In this nihilistic narrative, bitcoin (or Ethereum or whatever) will be the end-times currency of choice. It has rules and protocols, so it does not need governments and laws.  Such claims are ridiculous. The internet, the cloud and the whole network of computers needed to keep bitcoin in business can only function with the support of reasonably effective governments. If anarchy ever comes, computer records, especially complex distributed systems like bitcoin, will be totally useless.  The problems with crypto-currencies are so glaring that something irrational must be sustaining the zeal. One possibility is that bitcoin has become what could be called a post-modern luxury good. Unlike most luxuries, they offer no beauty, pleasure or even natural scarcity. They do not really even have artificial scarcity, since it’s fairly easy to create a new one. What they can offer is the strange and decadent charm of self-created value.  Before letting the dogs of cultural criticism loose, though, there is a far simpler explanation: the well-known distortion of judgment caused by greed. When buyers of bitcoin talk about blockchain, dangerous governments or the coming apocalypse they are merely putting a thin whitewash of intellectual respectability over their craving for capital gains.   For now, bitcoin is working out well for speculators, if not for society. Here is a helpful market hint for holders, though. Do not all try to cash in at once. Or better yet, do, and soon. The bigger the bitcoin bubble becomes, the more likely it is to do serious economic damage when it bursts.  Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

304,UPDATE 3-Bitcoin skids amid broad cryptocurrency sell-off,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1PS2HM,"February 02, 2018 04:38pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies plunged on Friday, with bitcoin at one point sliding below $8,000 and headed for its biggest weekly loss since December 2013, amid worries about a regulatory clampdown globally.  The currencies have come off their lows but analysts said the sell-off was probably not over.  This week’s slump brought the total market value of cryptocurrencies down to around $400 billion, half the high it reached in January, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com. The market value of cryptocurrencies is calculated by multiplying the number of digital coins in existence by their price, although many question whether that is the right way to value them.   Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, fell as much as 15 percent on Friday to a two-month low of $7,625 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BSP. It clawed back some losses and was down around 5.6 percent at $8,498 in late  New York trading.  The virtual currency is down by close to 25 percent this week and almost 40 percent in 2018. It surged more than 1,000 percent though in 2017.  For some market participants, bitcoin may be down, but it is not likely to fade.  “Bitcoin has become, and will continue to be, primarily a speculative asset class,” said David Moskowitz, Co-founder and Director of Indorse, the decentralized social network for professionals.   He added that the recent drops in transaction fees have made it easier to use bitcoin for payments once again. And if a payment solution can help the congestion, bitcoin may once again become an effective payment network, Moskowitz said.  The second and third largest virtual currencies, Ethereum and Ripple, also plunged more than 20 percent at the session low, Coinmarketcap.com said. Ethereum was last down 13.2 percent, at $888.22, while Ripple last traded at 83 U.S. cents, down 14.7 percent.  Retail investors have poured money into digital coins, enticed by the huge run-up in prices. Regulators say cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and dangerous investments.   On Thursday, India vowed to eradicate the use of crypto-assets, joining China and South Korea in promising to ban parts of the nascent market where prices have boomed in recent years.  Social media website Facebook (FB.O) said this week it would ban cryptocurrency advertisements because many were associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices. U.S. regulators have sent a subpoena to two of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency players, Bitfinex and Tether  A massive $530 million hack of a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange last week renewed worries about the security of the industry.  Critics of virtual currencies have called the run-up in prices a speculative bubble, but supporters of cryptocurrencies say short-term price volatility is to be expected, and the blockchain technology underpinning these assets maintains its power and value.   Going back to 2011 and including the current selloff, bitcoin’s price has been halved nine times on the Bitstamp exchange before recovering. The last time was from November 2014 to January 2015.

307,UPDATE 4-Banks in Britain and U.S. ban Bitcoin buying with credit cards,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1PU10Y,"February 05, 2018 12:32pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain and the United States have banned the use of credit cards to buy Bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies”, fearing a plunge in their value will leave customers unable to repay their debts.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY.L), which issues just over a quarter of all credit cards in Britain, and Virgin Money VM.L said they would ban credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N).  The move is aimed at protecting customers from running up huge debts from buying virtual currencies on credit, if their values were to plummet, a Lloyds spokeswoman said.  Concerns have arisen among credit card providers because their customers have increasingly been using credit cards to fund accounts on online exchanges, which are then used to purchase the digital currencies.  However, other banks said on Monday they will continue to allow credit card customers to buy cryptocurrencies.  “We constantly review our protections for customers as a responsible bank and lender, and are keeping this matter under close review,” a spokeswoman for Barclays said.  Barclays is Britain’s leading credit card issuer with a market share of around 27 percent through its Barclaycard brand.  “At present UK customers can use both their Barclays debit card and Barclaycard credit card to purchase cryptocurrency legitimately,” the Barclays spokeswoman said.  Spain’s second-biggest bank BBVA (BBVA.MC) also said it has no restrictions in place on such purchases.    Last week Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second biggest payments network, said customers buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards fueled a 1 percentage point increase in overseas transaction volumes in the fourth quarter.  At that time Bitcoin was staging a spectacular rise in value, reaching a peak of $19,187 on Dec. 16 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   But the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has since fallen dramatically and on Monday was down by 11 percent to $7255 at 1719 GMT on Bitstamp, extending losses from Friday amid worries of a global regulatory clampdown.  The decision on whether to allow credit card users to buy cryptocurrencies is a credit risk decision made by the card-issuing banks, a spokesman for Mastercard said.  A spokeswoman for Chase bank said it is not currently processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies because of the volatility and risk involved, while a Citi spokeswoman confirmed a similar ban, but did not give a reason.  The bans extends only to credit card purchases, with debit card users still able to buy cryptocurrencies.   “Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email.  Lloyds did not say how it planned to enforce the ban, although the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday that its credit card customers will be blocked from buying Bitcoin online through a “blacklist” that will flag sellers.  A spokeswoman from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) declined to comment on the bank’s policy.  Europe’s biggest bank HSBC (HSBA.L) did not respond to requests for comment on whether it permits credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.  Concerns about the use of Bitcoin and other such currencies extend beyond the use of credit cards for borrowing.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain should take a serious look at digital currencies such as Bitcoin because of the way they can be used by criminals.

The six-hour online auction will be held on Jan. 22, the Marshals said in a statement, with the 3,813 bitcoins offered for sale in 11 blocks - five of 500 bitcoins, five of 100 bitcoins and one block of around 813 bitcoins.

The government held three auctions in 2014 and 2015 for bitcoins seized during the prosecution of the creator of Silk Road, an online black market where the virtual currency could be used to buy illegal drugs and other goods.  Silk Road operated for more than two years, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, before being shut down in October 2013.

310,"Bitcoin soars to record high above $6,000",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1MV1D8,"October 20, 2017 03:13pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin surged to a record high of more than $6,000 on Friday, pushing its market capitalization to $100 billion at one point, as investors continued to bet on an asset that has a limited supply and has paved the way for a whole slew of crypto-currencies.  The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.  On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.  It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.  Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.  Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.   “As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.  Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.   But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.  “China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.  “As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.   Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.  A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year. Bitcoins and ether, another digital currency, are used to purchase tokens for ICOs.

311,Bitcoin needs regulatory framework to change 'risky' image,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4C0LQ20140513,"May 13, 2014 01:05pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators should create a framework of rules to help to make virtual currencies such as bitcoin more attractive to ordinary consumers, a lawyer from the Bitcoin Foundation said on Tuesday.  Bitcoin made headlines earlier this year when Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after saying it might have lost some 750,000 bitcoins in hacking attack.  Patrick Murck, general counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation, said cooperation was needed between authorities to create rules that would support those using the digital currency responsibly.  “There’s an opportunity to work together to stop people saying it’s scary and risky,” he said. “The challenge is just to get a framework out there that makes sense for people,” said Murck, speaking at an event on the state of digital economy.  Launched in 2009, bitcoin offers a way for people to conduct transactions over the Internet. Supporters say the anonymity that bitcoin offers lowers the risk of fraud, while critics say that same anonymity and lack of central oversight make it easier to commit crimes.  The Bitcoin Foundation aims to standardise the currency, protect it from theft or counterfeiting and provide education.  Some companies involved in bitcoin, including investment firms and those providing services for the currency’s users, have also called for regulation to ensure their customers feel more comfortable about virtual money.  A number of regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have warned investors about the risks of scams related to virtual currencies.  Murck said there were a handful of well-funded companies working towards making bitcoin more attractive and safer for ordinary consumers by trying to insure bitcoin holdings and to reduce the currency’s volatility.  Those companies have learned from the collapse of Mt. Gox and have more knowledge about how the industry works that was not available before, he said.  Bitcoin could be ready for the mass market by the end of the year, Murck added. “I feel much more confident today than I did 12 months ago. The wind is definitely blowing at our backs.”  The banking industry also has a role to play in opening the bitcoin market up, Murck said, by providing finance to companies involved in bitcoin or integrating bitcoin services into its own products.

Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY.L), which issues just over a quarter of all credit cards in Britain, and Virgin Money VM.L said they would ban credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N).  The move is aimed at protecting customers from running up huge debts from buying virtual currencies on credit, if their values were to plummet, a Lloyds spokeswoman said.  Concerns have arisen among credit card providers because their customers have increasingly been using credit cards to fund accounts on online exchanges, which are then used to purchase the digital currencies.  However, other banks said on Monday they will continue to allow credit card customers to buy cryptocurrencies.  “We constantly review our protections for customers as a responsible bank and lender, and are keeping this matter under close review,” a spokeswoman for Barclays said.  Barclays is Britain’s leading credit card issuer with a market share of around 27 percent through its Barclaycard brand.  “At present UK customers can use both their Barclays debit card and Barclaycard credit card to purchase cryptocurrency legitimately,” the Barclays spokeswoman said.  Spain’s second-biggest bank BBVA (BBVA.MC) also said it has no restrictions in place on such purchases.    Last week Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second biggest payments network, said customers buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards fueled a 1 percentage point increase in overseas transaction volumes in the fourth quarter.  At that time Bitcoin was staging a spectacular rise in value, reaching a peak of $19,187 on Dec. 16 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   But the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has since fallen dramatically and on Monday was down by 11 percent to $7255 at 1719 GMT on Bitstamp, extending losses from Friday amid worries of a global regulatory clampdown.  The decision on whether to allow credit card users to buy cryptocurrencies is a credit risk decision made by the card-issuing banks, a spokesman for Mastercard said.  A spokeswoman for Chase bank said it is not currently processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies because of the volatility and risk involved, while a Citi spokeswoman confirmed a similar ban, but did not give a reason.  The bans extends only to credit card purchases, with debit card users still able to buy cryptocurrencies.   “Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email.  Lloyds did not say how it planned to enforce the ban, although the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday that its credit card customers will be blocked from buying Bitcoin online through a “blacklist” that will flag sellers.  A spokeswoman from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) declined to comment on the bank’s policy.  Europe’s biggest bank HSBC (HSBA.L) did not respond to requests for comment on whether it permits credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.  Concerns about the use of Bitcoin and other such currencies extend beyond the use of credit cards for borrowing.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain should take a serious look at digital currencies such as Bitcoin because of the way they can be used by criminals.

314,Breakingviews: Bitcoin's defects will hasten its demise in 2015,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0UA0GT20141226,"December 26, 2014 11:12am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bitcoin’s defects will hasten its demise in 2015. The leading crypto-currency’s economies of scale in mining and its transaction system’s vulnerability to subversion by a dominant miner make it unsound. As seignorage declines it will become cost-uncompetitive for transactions. These flaws will cause its price to lose further altitude.  The digital currency is controlled not by a state but by an underlying algorithm by which participants can “mine” bitcoins through solving mathematical problems. The universe of miners can then validate “blockchains” of bitcoin transactions by majority vote, weighted by their mining effort. As a reward, miners receive more bitcoins, distributed randomly.  By combining their activities, the currency’s creators can increase their probability of receiving a bitcoin, which can be shared between them. Assuming miners are risk-averse, the system slants toward monopoly. This theoretical tendency is validated by the current bitcoin setup, in which a single mine, GHash.IO, which pools the interests of individual participants, currently controls about 39 percent of mining activity, according to Blockchain.com.  If a miner came to control more than half of bitcoin creation, it could choose which blockchains to validate; the participants would then depend upon its integrity, no differently than they depend on trust in a government in a fiat money system.  Over time, the rate of bitcoin production declines and the amount of “work” required to produce one increases. By early October, 2014, the “hash rate” per bitcoin had increased 60 billion-fold since January 2010. Moore’s Law, defining the increasing power of processors, counteracts this but not sufficiently; a July 2014 study by Australian researcher Hass McCook calculated that the cost of bitcoin production including equipment was about $600 per coin and the marginal cost of power was about $57 per coin. These figures compare with the current bitcoin price of around $325, suggesting that capacity will decline over time unless the price rises sharply.  If mining bitcoins is profitable, big miners can use this seignorage to subsidize transaction fees. Once mining profits disappear, transaction fees must subsidize mining, since only active miners can validate transactions. This makes bitcoin uncompetitive with other electronic transaction systems in the long term.  Bitcoin’s flaws are becoming more evident, which may explain why prices more than halved in 2014. That trend should continue.  - Bitcoin was trading around $325 on Dec. 26, down from a peak price of $1,151 in December 2013.   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

315,Bubble or breakthrough? Bitcoin keeps central bankers on edge,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DR0MQ,"November 27, 2017 03:21am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Central bankers say the success of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is just a bubble.  But it keeps them awake at night because these private currencies threaten their control of the banking system and money supply, which could undermine the monetary policies they use to manage inflation.  With bitcoin smashing through the $8,000 level for the first time this week after a 50 percent climb in eight days, they are also worried they will be blamed if the market crashes.  This is why several central banks are advocating regulations to impose control. Others are even looking at whether to introduce their own digital currency and are testing payment platforms.   “The problem with bitcoin is that it could easily blow up and central banks could then be accused of not doing anything,” European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters.  “So we’re trying to understand whether bank activity in relation to cryptocurrency trading needs to be better regulated.”  The global cryptocurrency market is worth $245 billion which is tiny compared to the trillion dollar plus balance sheets of the Bank of Japan, the U.S. Federal Reserve or the ECB.   These institutions issue yen, U.S. dollars and euros, both by creating physical cash or by crediting banks’ accounts, as is the case with their bond-buying programs.  Cryptocurrencies, however, are not centralized. They do not pass through regulated banks and traditional payment systems. Instead, they often use blockchain, an online ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of anonymous computers on the internet.  This has raised concerns about their vulnerability to hackers, as underlined by a score of incidents in recent months, and their use to finance crime.  Cryptocurrencies holders also have a claim on a private, rather than a public entity, which could go bust or stop functioning.  For these reasons, and given their low adoption by retailers, central banks have dismissed cryptocurrencies as risky commodities with no bearing on the real economy.  “Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said in September, comparing it to the Dutch 17th century trading bubble. “It’s an instrument of speculation.”   China and South Korea, where cryptocurrency speculation is popular, banned fundraising through token launches, whereby a newly cryptocurrency is sold to finance a product development.  Russia’s central bank said it would block websites selling bitcoin and its rivals while the ECB told European Union lawmakers last year “they should not seek... to promote the use of virtual currencies” because these could “in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply of money” and inflation.  Yet Japan in April recognized bitcoin as legal tender and approved several companies as operators of cryptocurrency exchanges but required them register with the government.  The ECB, the Bank of Japan and Germany’s Bundesbank are already testing blockchain, admitting it may have a future use for the settling of payments.  The BOJ last year set up a section in charge of fintech to offer guidance to banks seeking new business opportunities, and  joined up with the ECB to study distributed ledger technology(DLT) like blockchain. They concluded that blockchain was not mature enough to power the world’s biggest payment systems.      Commercial banks have so far been lukewarm to existing digital currencies.  But with electronic payments already supplanting cash, they’re alert to the danger that they would lose business if their clients decided to switch to them.  For this reason, Swiss banking giant UBS is leading a consortium of six banks trying to create its own digital cash equivalent of each of the major currencies backed by central banks.  This would allow financial markets to make payments and settle transactions more quickly.  This poses risks for central bankers, as the guardian of the banking and payment system.  “(We could) wake up one day and most of the big banks have been eviscerated and most of that activity has moved elsewhere,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Reuters in a recent interview.  This could lead to a financial crisis if regulators lost sight of the activity, he said.  Some central banks such as Sweden’s Riksbank and the Bank of England are also looking at the merits of introducing their own digital currency.  Holders would have a direct claim on the central bank - just like with banknotes but without the inconvenience of storing large amounts of cash.  In Sweden, where most retail payments are electronic, the Riksbank said it was looking into an e-krona for small payments between consumers, companies and authorities.  “An e-krona would give the general public access to digital complement to cash guaranteed by the state and several payment services suppliers could connect to the e-krona system,” the Riksbank said.      A central bank digital currency (CBDC) could also change the way monetary policy is carried out by allowing central banks to inject liquidity directly into the real economy, bypassing the financial sector, if they want to boost inflation.  This could help make monetary policy more effective, according to a study by economists at the Bank of England.  But it could also be risky if depositors were tempted to convert their bank deposits into central bank money during a banking crisis, accelerating any run on commercial banks.  A senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said on Wednesday that although technology is revolutionizing banking, digital currencies will not replace physical money any time soon.  “It’s too far off,” Hiromi Yamaoka, head of the BOJ’s payment and settlement systems department, said on the sidelines of a forum on financial innovation hosted by Thomson Reuters.  “It would change the banking system too drastically.”      Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi in Frankfurt, Howard Schneider in Washington, David Milliken in London and Leika Kihara in Tokyo; editing by Anna Willard",-0.017414285714285705,0.07890245997388853
316,"$10,000 in sight for bitcoin as it rockets to new record high",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DR0WC,"November 27, 2017 07:16pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s vertiginous ascent showed no signs of abating on Monday, with the cryptocurrency soaring to another record high just a few percent away from $10,000 after gaining more than a fifth in value over the past three days alone.   The digital currency has seen an eye-watering tenfold increase in its value since the start of the year and has more than doubled in value since the beginning of October, lifted by the prospect of crossing over into the financial mainstream, amid a flurry of crypto-hedge fund launches.  It surged as much as 4.5 percent on Monday to trade at $9,721 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, before easing back to around $9,600 by 1155 GMT.   Data compiled by Alistair Milne, the Monaco-based manager of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, showed U.S. bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase added 300,000 users between Wednesday and Sunday, during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The total number of Coinbase users globally now stands at 13.3 million.     “The Coinbase data is evidence that adoption is not slowing down,” Milne told Reuters. “Breaking $10,000 seems inevitable following the recent price action.”   Bitcoin’s price has been helped in recent months by the announcement that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator CME Group would start offering bitcoin futures. The company said last week the futures would launch by the end of the year though no precise date had been set.  So far, institutional investors have largely stayed away from the market, viewing it as too volatile, too risky and too complex to invest other people’s money into. But some say the launch of the CME futures could lure in more mainstream investors.   “Promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional money are supercharging the price,” said Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency data analysis website Cryptocompare.  BIGGER THAN WAL-MART   The latest price surge brought bitcoin’s “market cap” - its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system - to more than $163 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.   The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, topped $300 billion for the first time, the site said, making their estimated market value greater than that of Wal-Mart.   The staggering price increases seen in the crypto-market have led to multiple warnings from central bankers, investment bankers and other investors that it has reached bubble territory.  Some say that this could prompt regulators in the West to crack down on the market in a similar fashion to China, where bitcoin exchanges were shut down earlier this year.  “Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge but (they) have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved,” said David Futter, a fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, in London.   “If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.”    Bitcoin’s biggest rival, ether - sometimes referred to as Ethereum, the name for the project behind it - has seen even more stratospheric gains this year, up more than 6000 percent. It hit an all-time high just below $500 on Monday, with its market cap nearing $50 billion.  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Toby Chopra",0.12432380952380953,0.08951530612244898

323,UPDATE 1-Shorts on top as January Cboe bitcoin futures settle,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1PC1T6,"January 17, 2018 05:07pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin was seen as coming to the big leagues with the launch of U.S. futures trading in December. For those keeping score at home, the first round of this series was a resounding win for bitcoin bears over the bulls.  With the first contract expiring on Wednesday, the hedge funds and other speculative investors that took out bets that bitcoin was due for a pullback have likely made a handsome profit.  Meanwhile, the bulls who took the other side of that trade, mostly small investors, have largely seen their positions expire worthless courtesy of a massive selloff across the cryptocurrency complex since futures trading launched.  The cash-settled bitcoin futures allow investors and speculators to place bets on whether bitcoin will soar or slip, without holding bitcoin itself.  The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  On Wednesday, the official auction price for bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange was $10,900, compared with an auction price of $17,285.89, on Dec. 11, the first full day of Cboe bitcoin futures trading.  So far, speculative positioning on the Cboe bitcoin contracts has leaned to the short side. To be short a futures contract means traders believe the underlying security will fall in value.  Speculators’ net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,907 contracts in the week to Jan. 9, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.   The bulk of volume and open interest had been centered in the front month, suggesting much of that short position is likewise concentrated in January.  To be sure, some front-month positions may have since been closed out or rolled forward into future months.    “Someone who shorted bitcoin futures last week would potentially be very happy this week,” said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group Inc in Greenwich, Connecticut.  With South Korea, Japan and China all making noises about a regulatory swoop, and officials in France and the United States vowing to investigate cryptocurrencies, investor fears have hit bitcoin prices hard in recent weeks.  Bitcoin has lost about 37 percent of its value on the Gemini Exchange since Dec. 11.  While the initial bitcoin futures trading may have favored bears, it is still early days, said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories.  “We will see the risk appetite if bitcoin rises abruptly. I could see people throwing up their hands and discarding the idea of shorting bitcoin altogether. I could also see people piling on if it gets to $8,000 or lower,” Gottlieb said.  “For now, it is in a spot of disequilibrium. This asset is either worth a lot less or a lot more, but $10,000 is not a resting spot, in my opinion.”     Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli",0.15124230769230768,0.0666028416028416
324,Bitcoin exchange Kraken to help in Mt. Gox bankruptcy,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0TG2LD20141126,"November 26, 2014 04:49am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. bitcoin exchange operator Payward Inc said on Wednesday it will work on retrieving some millions of dollars lost by Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in bankruptcy this year.  Kraken, Payward’s bitcoin exchange, will assist Mt. Gox’s Tokyo-court appointed trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi with investigating where the missing bitcoins are, along with eventually redistributing any found to creditors as part of a liquidation.  The partnership between Payward and Mt. Gox was approved by the Tokyo district court on Wednesday. Kraken will not be paid for the arrangement but could win new clients as former account holders at Mt. Gox register to receive future distributions from the liquidation.  “We hope to revive bitcoin’s reputation and create a healthy market for it, ultimately leading to profit for us,” Ayako Miyaguchi, managing director of Kraken’s Japanese operations,told reporters.  Once handling 80 percent of the world’s bitcoin trades, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February in Tokyo after it lost 750,000 of its users’ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Mark Karpeles, the 28 year-old French CEO of Mt. Gox, blamed hackers for the loss.  The lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt. Gox also said $28 million were “missing” from its Japanese bank accounts.  Karpeles later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins.  The collapse of Mt. Gox was a setback for a five-year-old virtual currency that proponents see as a still-developing alternative to traditional money.  Kraken, a San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange, announced in October that it was launching trading between bitcoin and the yen, saying it was the only major exchange to offer a dedicated bitcoin/yen order book.

325,"$10,000 in sight for bitcoin as it rockets to new record high",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DR0WC,"November 27, 2017 07:16pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s vertiginous ascent showed no signs of abating on Monday, with the cryptocurrency soaring to another record high just a few percent away from $10,000 after gaining more than a fifth in value over the past three days alone.   The digital currency has seen an eye-watering tenfold increase in its value since the start of the year and has more than doubled in value since the beginning of October, lifted by the prospect of crossing over into the financial mainstream, amid a flurry of crypto-hedge fund launches.  It surged as much as 4.5 percent on Monday to trade at $9,721 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, before easing back to around $9,600 by 1155 GMT.   Data compiled by Alistair Milne, the Monaco-based manager of the Altana Digital Currency Fund, showed U.S. bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase added 300,000 users between Wednesday and Sunday, during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The total number of Coinbase users globally now stands at 13.3 million.     “The Coinbase data is evidence that adoption is not slowing down,” Milne told Reuters. “Breaking $10,000 seems inevitable following the recent price action.”   Bitcoin’s price has been helped in recent months by the announcement that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator CME Group would start offering bitcoin futures. The company said last week the futures would launch by the end of the year though no precise date had been set.  So far, institutional investors have largely stayed away from the market, viewing it as too volatile, too risky and too complex to invest other people’s money into. But some say the launch of the CME futures could lure in more mainstream investors.   “Promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional money are supercharging the price,” said Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency data analysis website Cryptocompare.  BIGGER THAN WAL-MART   The latest price surge brought bitcoin’s “market cap” - its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system - to more than $163 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.   The market cap of all cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, topped $300 billion for the first time, the site said, making their estimated market value greater than that of Wal-Mart.   The staggering price increases seen in the crypto-market have led to multiple warnings from central bankers, investment bankers and other investors that it has reached bubble territory.  Some say that this could prompt regulators in the West to crack down on the market in a similar fashion to China, where bitcoin exchanges were shut down earlier this year.  “Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge but (they) have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved,” said David Futter, a fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, in London.   “If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.”    Bitcoin’s biggest rival, ether - sometimes referred to as Ethereum, the name for the project behind it - has seen even more stratospheric gains this year, up more than 6000 percent. It hit an all-time high just below $500 on Monday, with its market cap nearing $50 billion.  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Toby Chopra",0.12432380952380953,0.08951530612244898
326,Breakingviews: Bitcoin's defects will hasten its demise in 2015,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0UA0GT20141226,"December 26, 2014 11:12am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bitcoin’s defects will hasten its demise in 2015. The leading crypto-currency’s economies of scale in mining and its transaction system’s vulnerability to subversion by a dominant miner make it unsound. As seignorage declines it will become cost-uncompetitive for transactions. These flaws will cause its price to lose further altitude.  The digital currency is controlled not by a state but by an underlying algorithm by which participants can “mine” bitcoins through solving mathematical problems. The universe of miners can then validate “blockchains” of bitcoin transactions by majority vote, weighted by their mining effort. As a reward, miners receive more bitcoins, distributed randomly.  By combining their activities, the currency’s creators can increase their probability of receiving a bitcoin, which can be shared between them. Assuming miners are risk-averse, the system slants toward monopoly. This theoretical tendency is validated by the current bitcoin setup, in which a single mine, GHash.IO, which pools the interests of individual participants, currently controls about 39 percent of mining activity, according to Blockchain.com.  If a miner came to control more than half of bitcoin creation, it could choose which blockchains to validate; the participants would then depend upon its integrity, no differently than they depend on trust in a government in a fiat money system.  Over time, the rate of bitcoin production declines and the amount of “work” required to produce one increases. By early October, 2014, the “hash rate” per bitcoin had increased 60 billion-fold since January 2010. Moore’s Law, defining the increasing power of processors, counteracts this but not sufficiently; a July 2014 study by Australian researcher Hass McCook calculated that the cost of bitcoin production including equipment was about $600 per coin and the marginal cost of power was about $57 per coin. These figures compare with the current bitcoin price of around $325, suggesting that capacity will decline over time unless the price rises sharply.  If mining bitcoins is profitable, big miners can use this seignorage to subsidize transaction fees. Once mining profits disappear, transaction fees must subsidize mining, since only active miners can validate transactions. This makes bitcoin uncompetitive with other electronic transaction systems in the long term.  Bitcoin’s flaws are becoming more evident, which may explain why prices more than halved in 2014. That trend should continue.  - Bitcoin was trading around $325 on Dec. 26, down from a peak price of $1,151 in December 2013.   (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

327,REUTERS SUMMIT-Bubbly bitcoin not worth the wager - investors,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1NM3ND,"November 17, 2017 11:04am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin may have surged a staggering 700 percent since the start of the year but most investors at a Reuters Summit this week said they had not been tempted to play the volatile cryptocurrency.  The difficulty of assigning a fair value to a speculative instrument that is less than a decade old and lacks the fundamentals that drive other asset classes was the main reason for steering clear of bitcoin, investors speaking at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit said.  Others said the cryptocurrency’s use for criminal purposes such as money laundering was another reason to stay away, as was the widespread perception that the bitcoin rally was another bubble destined to burst.  “Can you live without bitcoins? Yes. Could you live without tulips in the Netherlands? Yes,” Sankaran Naren, CIO of ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company, said at the Reuters Summit in Mumbai, referring to the tulip mania bubble in the Netherlands in the 17th century.  While a single bitcoin is worth nearly $8,000 BTC=BTSP, Japan Post Bank (7182.T) Chief Investment Officer Katsunori Sago said he believed its fair value was about $100 and it would have to fall to that level before the bank would consider buying it.  The idea that the bitcoin market, which is now worth $130 billion, constituted a bubble was the broad consensus among participants at the investment summit, which took place in London, Mumbai, New York, Singapore and Tokyo.  Bitcoin was created in 2008 as a Web-based cryptocurrency to move money around quickly and anonymously but the market is not yet regulated by any mainstream financial institution.  While scores of digital currency hedge funds have been launched this year, institutional investors worry that bitcoin is too lightly regulated, too volatile and too illiquid to risk investing other people’s money in.  The difficulty in having an idea what bitcoin’s value should be also means that institutional investors are not just staying away from buying the currency, but also staying away from selling, or “shorting”, it.  “Bubbles can go on for much longer, and get much bigger, than anybody ever predicted before they start, and therefore when you’re shorting something you need to be very very careful,” Peter Fitzgerald, head of multi-assets at Aviva Investors, told the Reuters Summit in London.  Even the imminent launch of bitcoin futures by the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group Inc (CME.O), would not be enough to entice most mainstream investors. But it would draw in some.   Major British hedge fund firm Man Group (EMG.L) said it would add cryptocurrencies to its investment universe if the CME bitcoin future is launched in December, as planned.   CME Group said last month it would launch a futures contract for bitcoin later this year in response to increasing interest from clients.  Laurence Fink, CEO and founder of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc. (BLK.N), said he wondered why bitcoin got so much media attention, particularly given its use in money laundering.       “I don’t think about bitcoin; it’s just not even on my mind,” Fink told the Reuters Summit, though he allowed that while it’s a tiny product, “it’s fun to watch”.       Still, many investors at the summit said while they were shunning bitcoin and the hundreds of other cryptocurrencies launched in recent years, they were interested in investing in the technology known as blockchain that underpins them.  BlackRock’s Fink said blockchain did have a legitimate future, even if its widespread use was some way off.  Blockchain works as a tamper-proof shared database network that updates itself in real-time, automatically processing and settling transactions using computer algorithms with no need for third-party verification.   Banks and other financial firms are investing heavily in the technology, believing it could reduce costs and make their operations faster and more efficient.  “I travel a lot and I meet a lot of clients. Very rarely do I get asked about bitcoin - I don’t know where that excitement exactly resides,” Joachim Fels, global economic advisor and a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), which has about $1.69 trillion in assets under management, told the summit in New York.   “But we spend a lot of time internally to look at what’s behind this, to look at the ... implications of blockchain for the way how transactions are recorded and what it means in terms of potential for disruption in the financial sector,” he said.  Many summit participants said interest in cryptocurrencies in the mainstream investment universe was limited to high-net worth individuals and companies managing portfolios for individual wealthy families.  But Mike Novogratz, former star macro hedge fund manager at Fortree Investment Group and now CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, said institutional investors were only about six to eight months away from adopting bitcoin.  “The institutionalisation of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said at the summit in New York.

Paul was in his home state of Kentucky on Tuesday to launch his 2016 White House bid. [ID:nL2N0X40QO] His campaign website, Stand With Rand, went live to coincide with the launch.  The website’s donation page reminds individuals that they are allowed to contribute up to $2,700 per election cycle and gives them the option of using a credit card, the online service PayPal or bitcoin.  The move to allow bitcoin donations reflects the Kentucky senator’s tendency to embrace new technology, his courting of Silicon Valley donors and outreach to younger voters, which would be a core constituency of a successful Paul campaign.  Paul, a libertarian, supports a flat income tax, cutting government spending to balance the budget, lessening the authority of the Federal Reserve and preserving personal liberties.  His campaign slogan is: “Defeat the Washington Machine.”  Bitcoin users favor the digital currency due to low transaction costs and instantaneous transfer.

329,Bubble or breakthrough? Bitcoin keeps central bankers on edge,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DR0MQ,"November 27, 2017 03:21am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Central bankers say the success of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is just a bubble.  But it keeps them awake at night because these private currencies threaten their control of the banking system and money supply, which could undermine the monetary policies they use to manage inflation.  With bitcoin smashing through the $8,000 level for the first time this week after a 50 percent climb in eight days, they are also worried they will be blamed if the market crashes.  This is why several central banks are advocating regulations to impose control. Others are even looking at whether to introduce their own digital currency and are testing payment platforms.   “The problem with bitcoin is that it could easily blow up and central banks could then be accused of not doing anything,” European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters.  “So we’re trying to understand whether bank activity in relation to cryptocurrency trading needs to be better regulated.”  The global cryptocurrency market is worth $245 billion which is tiny compared to the trillion dollar plus balance sheets of the Bank of Japan, the U.S. Federal Reserve or the ECB.   These institutions issue yen, U.S. dollars and euros, both by creating physical cash or by crediting banks’ accounts, as is the case with their bond-buying programs.  Cryptocurrencies, however, are not centralized. They do not pass through regulated banks and traditional payment systems. Instead, they often use blockchain, an online ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of anonymous computers on the internet.  This has raised concerns about their vulnerability to hackers, as underlined by a score of incidents in recent months, and their use to finance crime.  Cryptocurrencies holders also have a claim on a private, rather than a public entity, which could go bust or stop functioning.  For these reasons, and given their low adoption by retailers, central banks have dismissed cryptocurrencies as risky commodities with no bearing on the real economy.  “Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said in September, comparing it to the Dutch 17th century trading bubble. “It’s an instrument of speculation.”   China and South Korea, where cryptocurrency speculation is popular, banned fundraising through token launches, whereby a newly cryptocurrency is sold to finance a product development.  Russia’s central bank said it would block websites selling bitcoin and its rivals while the ECB told European Union lawmakers last year “they should not seek... to promote the use of virtual currencies” because these could “in principle affect the central banks’ control over the supply of money” and inflation.  Yet Japan in April recognized bitcoin as legal tender and approved several companies as operators of cryptocurrency exchanges but required them register with the government.  The ECB, the Bank of Japan and Germany’s Bundesbank are already testing blockchain, admitting it may have a future use for the settling of payments.  The BOJ last year set up a section in charge of fintech to offer guidance to banks seeking new business opportunities, and  joined up with the ECB to study distributed ledger technology(DLT) like blockchain. They concluded that blockchain was not mature enough to power the world’s biggest payment systems.      Commercial banks have so far been lukewarm to existing digital currencies.  But with electronic payments already supplanting cash, they’re alert to the danger that they would lose business if their clients decided to switch to them.  For this reason, Swiss banking giant UBS is leading a consortium of six banks trying to create its own digital cash equivalent of each of the major currencies backed by central banks.  This would allow financial markets to make payments and settle transactions more quickly.  This poses risks for central bankers, as the guardian of the banking and payment system.  “(We could) wake up one day and most of the big banks have been eviscerated and most of that activity has moved elsewhere,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Reuters in a recent interview.  This could lead to a financial crisis if regulators lost sight of the activity, he said.  Some central banks such as Sweden’s Riksbank and the Bank of England are also looking at the merits of introducing their own digital currency.  Holders would have a direct claim on the central bank - just like with banknotes but without the inconvenience of storing large amounts of cash.  In Sweden, where most retail payments are electronic, the Riksbank said it was looking into an e-krona for small payments between consumers, companies and authorities.  “An e-krona would give the general public access to digital complement to cash guaranteed by the state and several payment services suppliers could connect to the e-krona system,” the Riksbank said.      A central bank digital currency (CBDC) could also change the way monetary policy is carried out by allowing central banks to inject liquidity directly into the real economy, bypassing the financial sector, if they want to boost inflation.  This could help make monetary policy more effective, according to a study by economists at the Bank of England.  But it could also be risky if depositors were tempted to convert their bank deposits into central bank money during a banking crisis, accelerating any run on commercial banks.  A senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said on Wednesday that although technology is revolutionizing banking, digital currencies will not replace physical money any time soon.  “It’s too far off,” Hiromi Yamaoka, head of the BOJ’s payment and settlement systems department, said on the sidelines of a forum on financial innovation hosted by Thomson Reuters.  “It would change the banking system too drastically.”      Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi in Frankfurt, Howard Schneider in Washington, David Milliken in London and Leika Kihara in Tokyo; editing by Anna Willard",-0.017414285714285705,0.07890245997388853
330,Mind your wallet: why the underworld loves bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2D09820140314,"March 14, 2014 01:51am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Criminals may already have made off with up to $500 million worth of bitcoins since the virtual currency launched in 2009 - and you can double that if it turns out they emptied Mt. Gox.  Internet criminals, security experts say, are attracted to bitcoin because of its stratospheric rise in value, because it’s easier to steal than real money, and because it’s easier to trade with other criminal elements. But, they add, bitcoin will survive the damage.  “It’s just growing pains,” says Keith Jarvis, a security researcher at Dell SecureWorks. “Bitcoin is large enough and has enough momentum behind it to survive any public relations damage from this (Mt. Gox) case or anything else.”  The fall of Mt Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange which filed for bankruptcy last month after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins to hackers,  is certainly the virtual currency’s biggest crisis.  But data collated by Reuters from specialist bitcoin industry websites and internet forums shows that more than 730,000 bitcoins were already missing to theft, hacking, cyber-ransom payments and other apparently criminal pursuits before Mt. Gox’s collapse. That’s nearly 6 percent of all bitcoins, and doesn’t include dozens, possibly hundreds, of unreported cases of individuals who have lost bitcoins from their computers or online exchanges to hackers.  For sure, there’s no way of telling who has these missing bitcoins, or whether they were converted to real money when the price was much lower. And of course some bitcoins may have been counted twice if criminals stole them from each other or they were put back into circulation and stolen again.  But there’s no question that bitcoins have attracted the attention of cyber-criminals - as a currency and an asset worth stealing.  A study by Pat Litke and Joe Stewart of Dell SecureWorks showed that as the price of bitcoin soared beyond $1,000 last year, so did the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoins from wallets - programs that hold bitcoins on user’s computers or smartphones. Of the 140 types of such software more than 100 appeared in the past year.  Writing such viruses, says Stewart, is easy. “There’s no sophistication involved in the storage of bitcoin in wallets. As for malware, it’s some of the easiest stuff to write.”  Indeed, this cyber-pocket picking wasn’t criminals’ first foray into bitcoins. Initially, they focused on using their control of large networks of infected computers - called botnets - to make their own bitcoins.  Bitcoins are created through a ‘mining’ process where a computer’s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. For a while, says Kirill Levchenko, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, criminals added malware to their botnets to turn infected computers into bitcoin miners.  This triggered predictions of doom for bitcoin - that the criminals would take over the mining of bitcoin through botnets and bring the whole currency crashing down. But as bitcoins become harder to mine - according to an algorithm that slows down their production the more people try to create them - this approach has proven less profitable.  In 2012-13, says Danny Huang, another researcher at the University of California, San Diego, they earned at least 4,500 bitcoins, a relatively small sum compared with the total produced. “Few botnets are mining bitcoins now,” he said.  Instead, they’ve turned to stealing them from wallets, or, more lucratively, from exchanges.  According to data compiled last year by academics Tyler Moore and Nicholas Christin, of 40 exchanges tracked 18 had closed, with customer balances wiped out in many cases - not always, they point out, due to fraud. Since then, according to public reports, more than a dozen others have been hacked.  Cyber-criminals have also made use of the ease with which bitcoins can be traded without any third party - such as a bank or online payments service like PayPal - to use it as at least one way of paying for services between themselves.  “Bitcoin made it much easier for them, because they have to trust each other even less. Even complete strangers can cooperate,” said Juraj Bednar, a bitcoin security expert in Slovakia.  But while bitcoin has its advantages, it’s not a perfect tool for the bad guys.  Take, for example, ransomware. Viruses which encrypt users’ data and then demand payment for a key to unlock it have become increasingly sophisticated, says Dell Secureworks’ Jarvis.  The most successful: CryptoLocker, which Jarvis believes is run by a Russian-speaking gang who are also behind a botnet called Gameover Zeus that targets financial websites.  Bitcoin often appears on CryptoLocker as an option for victims to pay up. Its appeal, says Bednar, lies in the fact that it needs no third party for the transaction to work.  But there have been problems. For one thing, the type of user to be infected by a virus wasn’t likely to be the type who is technologically savvy enough to be familiar with bitcoin. Also, as bitcoin rose in value, it has become a more expensive option for the victim, forcing the criminals to lower their bitcoin ransom demands to match prevailing exchange rates.  Then there’s bitcoin’s transparency. All transactions are visible, and while they’re just digits and letters, in theory they could be connected to an individual and the entire history of all the bitcoin’s transactions traced.  Italian computer engineer Michele Spagnuolo, for example, was able to trace a number of ransom payments for CryptoLocker. The gains have been impressive: he and academics from Politecnico di Milano speculate that up to 6,757 bitcoins - then worth around $6 million - could be linked to those behind CryptoLocker late last year. That estimate of their total takings, he says, could be very conservative.  But the fact that such payments can be traced would raise a red flag for cyber-criminals, says Daniel Cohen of RSA, the security division of EMC Corp, even though there are online services that can “launder” bitcoins to hide their origin. “Sure, there are bitcoin laundering services, but still if I tie a wallet to an identity I can see every single movement,” he said.  And, ironically, the success that some criminals have had in stealing bitcoins has made it less appealing to the underworld. RSA’s Cohen says his team monitoring underground forums has noticed criminals lately see bitcoin as “volatile, seizable and, with the recent thefts, unsafe.”  That’s not to say bitcoin is out of the woods.  While the protocols underlying bitcoin have proved themselves to work, the weak links have been the software containing the wallets, whether on exchanges or on individuals’ computers.  “The attacks on the exchanges did not in themselves indicate any particular weakness of bitcoin per se, but rather exploiting vulnerabilities within the exchanges,” says Raj Samani of Intel Corp’s internet security company McAfee.  Such holes are being addressed, says Dell Secureworks’ Stewart, pointing to such innovations as hardware wallets to replace software ones. “We’re just going to have to get into that mode of thinking,” he says.  For now, bitcoin users remain a vulnerable target.  That was illustrated when hackers breached Mt. Gox’s servers and its owner’s blog this week to post files purporting to be Mt. Gox’s transactions in bitcoin stretching back to 2011.  Amid the files lurked another surprise awaiting the unwary: a bitcoin-stealing virus.

Dish said it selected Coinbase as the payment processor for bitcoin transactions with customers who choose to pay their bills online with the bitcoin wallet of their choice.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by any government or central bank and is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control.   Users can transfer bitcoins to each other online and store the currency in digital “wallets”.  Coinbase, funded by venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Y Combinator, is one such digital wallet.   In March, it launched its Instant Exchange feature, which will be used by Dish to convert bitcoins to U.S. dollars. Dish’s third quarter starts on July 1.  While bitcoins may not be an alternative to established currencies, they can cut the cost of moving money around.  PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that credit card companies charge around 3 percent in transaction fees and PayPal’s commission can go as high as 4 percent. The same transactions via bitcoin firms such as Coinbase and BitPay are likely to be free.   However, there’s skepticism about the future of bitcoin, with critics pointing to recent setbacks such as the Mt. Gox bankruptcy.  Mt. Gox, at one time the biggest bitcoin exchange, abruptly stopped trading in February after it lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking into its faulty computer system.

That’s because bitcoin, the digital currency, has largely been supplanted by blockchain, the technology that underlies it, as the main interest of investors, technology companies and financial institutions.  “If there is a 100 percent opportunity in the blockchain,  bitcoin, or the currency, is only 1 percent of it,” said Jerry Cuomo, vice president, Blockchain Technologies at International Business Machines Corp. “So there is a whole 99 percent that has broad applications across the broad industries.”  Over the past year numerous Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, have declared their commitment to pursuing blockchain as a potential revolutionary technology for tracking and clearing financial transactions.  The blockchain technology works by creating permanent, public “ledgers” of all transactions that could potentially replace complicated clearing and settlement systems with one simple ledger.  Still, bitcoin is by far the largest implementation of blockchain technology and there is considerable debate as to whether one can truly develop without the other.  “Bitcoin is still the only blockchain-enabled, cross-border large scale, provable application that’s actually in production,” said Joseph Guastella, a principal at Deloitte Consulting in New York. “Bitcoin as a currency may not be as relevant as it was in many ways, but it actually is relevant as a proof case for the blockchain technology.”  Bitcoins are created through a “mining” process, in which specialized computers solve complex math problems in exchange for bitcoins. One bitcoin is equivalent to $444.75 late on Monday and trade on various exchanges around the world.  But bitcoin transaction volume has been in decline over the past six months amid a bitter split over technical changes in the protocol that are needed to increase the capacity of the system that produces them. Because the cryptocurrency has no formal governance, it relies on a core group of developers for direction - and they are sharply divided over the changes.  But that debate was of relatively little concern to the Blockchain enthusiasts gathered in New York.  Australian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself on Monday as the creator of controversial digital currency bitcoin.  “It’s irrelevant because his announcement doesn’t solve a problem or resolve a conflict,” said Bharat Solanki, managing director at Cambrian Consulting in New York.  “It probably helps to determine the origins of bitcoin but only for recognition,” Solanki said.  For Naoki Taniguchi, a global innovation expert at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in San Francisco, he does not really care about who created bitcoin.  “It’s all about the blockchain,” he said.

Shanghai-based BTC China, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, posted a notice about the new regulations on its website, two weeks after Beijing banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin, due to the risks involved.  “Due to new government regulations, BTC China will temporarily suspend CNY deposits. BTC deposits/withdrawals and CNY withdrawals are not affected, and will continue to operate in the interim,” BTC China said in the notice.  The platform could no longer handle new deposits because its third-party payment provider had abruptly cut off service, said Chief Executive Bobby Lee.  “It was disconnected against our will,” said Lee, adding that BTC China had switched to the provider on Sunday as a precautionary measure.  On Tuesday, the Chinese Business News reported that the government had asked third-party payment services to stop handling bitcoin transactions.  It was not immediately clear whether other exchange platforms were affected.  The yuan-bitcoin exchange rate on BT China has dropped 46 percent from Monday, and 60 percent since a peak on Dec. 1. The exchange rate on rival platform FXBTC.com has fallen 70 percent from its Nov. 30 peak.  Over the past two months, the value of bitcoin relative to the dollar has skyrocketed some 800 percent as speculators have piled into the currency, according to bitcoinity.org.  Bitcoin market operators say Chinese nationals are major market participants and hold an outsize share of the total number of bitcoins in circulation.  The government this month issued a statement banning financial institutions from trading in bitcoin, but did not ban individual trading. [ID: nL4N0JK1KZ]  The statement, on the website of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), said the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, which is not backed by a government or central bank.  The PBOC may have cause to be concerned about bitcoin, which is anonymous, untraceable, and can be carried on memory sticks or transmitted electronically, because it represents a potential hole in the country’s capital controls.  However, analysts point out that, given the tiny value of the total bitcoin in circulation relative to other currencies, it is unlikely to have much impact on the wider economy.",-0.07056666666666667,-0.014950430228208007

Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which is designed to operate like an exchange-traded fund, will initially sell $20 million worth of shares, with each share worth a fraction of a Bitcoin, a  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Monday.  The shares are aimed at investors “seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk,” the prospectus reads.  Bitcoins are a form of electronic money that is not managed by a single company or government. They are “mined” by software running a set of algorithms and their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system’s control over the minting of money.  The value of a Bitcoin has been extremely volatile since the start of the year, rising from $13 in January to a peak of $266 in April and back down to around $100 last week.  Bitcoins have been touted by some as the future of money and gained in prominence amid the euro zone sovereign debt crisis as more people questioned the safety of holding their cash in the bank.  But others dismiss the currency as a Ponzi Scheme and authorities worry about its lack of regulation. In May, U.S. authorities seized two accounts linked to a major operator in the Bitcoin digital currency market.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose feud with Zuckerberg was portrayed in the fictionalized 2010 film “The Social Network,” have amassed nearly $11 million worth of Bitcoins, according to a report in the New York Times in April.

338,Nordic investor creates world's biggest Bitcoin database,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0KU11E20140120,"January 20, 2014 10:07am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"STOCKHOLM, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A Nordic venture capital firm says it has built the world’s largest database of businesses dealing in Bitcoins in an effort to shed light on a virtual currency which has seen its value rocket in the past year.  Creandum said the database contained more than 300 companies trading Bitcoins - ranging from exchanges to payment processors and gambling companies - and was intended to give entrepreneurs and investors an overview of companies with a significant role in the Bitcoin system.  Bitcoin is essentially software code that defines units of value, which users can move back and forth among themselves. Unlike other virtual money transmitters, its value isn’t pegged to a hard currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro - it is determined by the demand for Bitcoins.  Since its launch in January 2009, the system has grown popular with people who lack confidence in the traditional banking system, though it has also aroused concerns it could be used for money laundering.  Creandum, which has invested in fast-growing Nordic tech firms such as online music streaming service Spotify and payment solutions firm iZettle, said it hoped to encourage Bitcoin enthusiasts to participate in the development of the currency.  “This year and next year the Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a payment mechanism, and it could go either way,” Creandum associate Joel Eriksson Enquist told Reuters.  ""Our hope is that the database will work like Wikipedia, with more and more contributors and more comprehensive data,"" he said of the open-source site which can be found at bitcoin.knackhq.com/btcdb.  Creandum has not invested in any Bitcoin-related companies but is looking at a couple of players and Enquist himself is holding onto 10 Bitcoins he bought last year for a little over $100 each - just for the fun of it.  The Bitcoin has recently traded above $1,000, up from $10 at the start of last year and fuelling concerns of a bubble.  Creandum said it may take another three years before it is clear whether Bitcoin is a bubble, or whether this is “the beginning of a new world”.  In December, the digital currency was dealt a blow when the People’s Bank of China banned financial institutions, though not individuals, from trading in Bitcoins.  U.S. prosecutors are also sitting on millions of dollars worth of the currency which had belonged to Silk Road, an online market that authorities say was a conduit for purchasing drugs and computer hacking services.  Creandum’s database lists 46 Bitcoin exchanges in North America, 24 in Europe and 21 in Asia. BTC China and Europe’s btc-e and Bitstamp are the biggest exchanges, with the three seeing 2.5 million Bitcoins traded on their platforms in the 30 days to Jan. 9.  While there are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones appearing every week, Bitcoin is by far the best known.  E-commerce site Overstock.com recently announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency. Dating site OKCupid also allows Bitcoins as a form of payment.

339,Venezuelans turn to bitcoins to bypass socialist currency controls,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0HX11O20141008,"October 08, 2014 10:14am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Tech-savvy Venezuelans looking to bypass dysfunctional economic controls are turning to the bitcoin virtual currency to obtain dollars, make Internet purchases — and launch a little subversion.  Two New York-based Venezuelan brothers hope this week to start trading on the first bitcoin exchange in the socialist-run country, which already has at least several hundred bitcoin enthusiasts.   Due to currency controls introduced by late president Hugo Chavez a decade ago, acquiring hard currency now means either requesting it from the state, which struggles to satisfy demand, or tapping a shadowy black market. Even small dollar transactions are out of the question for most Venezuelans.  While President Nicolas Maduro makes frequent tirades against black market traders, whom he sees as part of the “economic war” on his government and the reason for inflation and shortages, he has never said anything about bitcoin. The government declined to comment on bitcoin policy.  That has created a gray market for bitcoins, a digital currency which is not governed by a central bank or controlled by a single source. Bitcoin values have soared and fallen in the last year as a popular exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed and some developed countries began to mull bitcoin regulation. In Venezuela, using bitcoins can carry a scent of subversion.  “Bitcoin is a way of rebelling against the system,” said one bitcoin trader, Caracas-based software developer John Villar, 32, who discovered the usefulness of bitcoin when he wanted to buy a $10 cellphone battery on Amazon.  Unable to pay for it in dollars, he bought bitcoin off a friend using local currency. He then used the bitcoin to purchase an Amazon gift certificate, with which he bought the battery.  Gerardo Mogollon, a business professor who styles himself as ‘Dr. Bitcoin Venezuela,’ speaks at conferences and appears in online videos to urge Venezuelans to adopt the currency.  “I’m teaching people to use bitcoin to bypass the exchange controls,” said Mogollon, a 42-year-old professor at the University of Tachira’s graduate business school.   Currently, bitcoin trading in Venezuela is between enthusiasts who use internet forums and social media to make ad hoc deals.  Venezuela-born brothers Kevin and Victor Charles, now based in New York, are this week hoping to open the “SurBitcoin” exchange, which will match bitcoin buyers and sellers online.  The price of a bitcoin price has dropped 70 percent to under $350 from a peak last November, illustrating one risk of the digital currency. But Venezuela’s own bolivar currency has dropped nearly 60 percent versus the dollar on the black market here in the last year. And a black market dollar costs 16 times more bolivars than the strongest Venezuelan government rate.   “Even though bitcoin is volatile, it’s still safer than the national currency,” said Kevin Charles, 22, who has just completed an economics degree in neighboring Colombia. Many convert the bitcoin immediately into dollars, in any case.  One of the difficulties of the new exchange will be finding a supply of bitcoins. One hope is that expatriates will use the exchange to send money home, selling bitcoins for bolivars.  Another answer is for Venezuelans to make their own bitcoins.  There are currently more than 13 million bitcoins in existence worldwide, worth nearly $4.5 billion, according to the popular Coinbase trading platform.  New bitcoins are generated by a process known as “mining”, in which computers solve complex problems.  Running high-end computer systems takes a lot of electricity, which is a competitive advantage for Venezuelans. Bills that could run to hundreds or thousands of dollars a month in the United States would amount to dollars for the same amount of power in Venezuela, thanks to government subsidies.  In a heavily air-conditioned Caracas home, one miner surrounds himself with specialized equipment which cost thousands of dollars. He asked not to be identified for fear of theft.  “In Venezuela, we have a gold fever: a bitcoin fever!” he said.

340,Banks in Britain and U.S. ban Bitcoin buying with credit cards,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1FO0UL,"February 05, 2018 01:24pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain and the United States have banned the use of credit cards to buy Bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies”, fearing a plunge in their value will leave customers unable to repay their debts.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY.L), which issues just over a quarter of all credit cards in Britain, and Virgin Money VM.L said they would ban credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N).  The move is aimed at protecting customers from running up huge debts from buying virtual currencies on credit, if their values were to plummet, a Lloyds spokeswoman said.  Concerns have arisen among credit card providers because their customers have increasingly been using credit cards to fund accounts on online exchanges, which are then used to purchase the digital currencies.  However, other banks said on Monday they will continue to allow credit card customers to buy cryptocurrencies.  “We constantly review our protections for customers as a responsible bank and lender, and are keeping this matter under close review,” a spokeswoman for Barclays said.  Barclays is Britain’s leading credit card issuer with a market share of around 27 percent through its Barclaycard brand.  “At present UK customers can use both their Barclays debit card and Barclaycard credit card to purchase cryptocurrency legitimately,” the Barclays spokeswoman said.  Spain’s second-biggest bank BBVA (BBVA.MC) also said it has no restrictions in place on such purchases.    Last week Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second biggest payments network, said customers buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards fueled a 1 percentage point increase in overseas transaction volumes in the fourth quarter.  At that time Bitcoin was staging a spectacular rise in value, reaching a peak of $19,187 on Dec. 16 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   But the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has since fallen dramatically and on Monday was down by 11 percent to $7255 at 1719 GMT on Bitstamp, extending losses from Friday amid worries of a global regulatory clampdown.  The decision on whether to allow credit card users to buy cryptocurrencies is a credit risk decision made by the card-issuing banks, a spokesman for Mastercard said.  A spokeswoman for Chase bank said it is not currently processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies because of the volatility and risk involved, while a Citi spokeswoman confirmed a similar ban, but did not give a reason.  The bans extends only to credit card purchases, with debit card users still able to buy cryptocurrencies.   “Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email.  Lloyds did not say how it planned to enforce the ban, although the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday that its credit card customers will be blocked from buying Bitcoin online through a “blacklist” that will flag sellers.  A spokeswoman from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) declined to comment on the bank’s policy.  Europe’s biggest bank HSBC (HSBA.L) did not respond to requests for comment on whether it permits credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.  Concerns about the use of Bitcoin and other such currencies extend beyond the use of credit cards for borrowing.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain should take a serious look at digital currencies such as Bitcoin because of the way they can be used by criminals.

342,Cyber attack on bitcoin a big warning to currency's users,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1B2AN20140212,"February 12, 2014 05:51pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A massive cyber attack from unknown sources that has been spamming bitcoin exchanges is highlighting some of the dangers people can encounter when they exchange cash for digital currencies like the bitcoin, experts said on Wednesday.  The attack, which is technically known as a distributed denial of service attack, involved thousands of phantom transactions, forcing at least three of the online platforms that store bitcoins and trade them for traditional currencies to halt withdrawals of bitcoins until they can determine which transactions were real.  It showed that bitcoin, which exists solely in cyberspace and operates on a software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers, is as vulnerable to such an assault as any other Internet-based business. It exposes the higher risks involved in owning and trading the instrument compared with the dollar and other traditional currencies. Bitcoins slumped in value as a result of the disruptions.  “Bitcoin is still an experimental protocol in its infancy,” said Micky Malka, a venture capitalist who is on the board of Bitcoin’s trade group, the Bitcoin Foundation.  “It will grow and mature over time,” he added. “No one should be investing an amount they cannot afford to lose.”  This week’s attack was not the first, said Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for blockchain.info, a website that tracks bitcoin activity and provides online storage services for bitcoin users.  Antonopoulos is also a member of a group of core bitcoin programmers and is part of an emergency response team of programmers who have been working to fix the flaws in the code governing some bitcoin transactions that the attackers were exploiting. He said that work that should be completed by the middle of next week, echoing an estimate provided by a spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation who said its core developers were all participating in the effort to fix the code.  Bitcoin is a decentralized digital system of value transfers that is not governed by any central bank, company or government. No assets back the bitcoin, whose value has fluctuated widely as its visibility has increased. Last September, a bitcoin was worth around $150. By late December the value was near the $1,000 mark.  Regulators around the world are struggling how to categorize the bitcoin. Some want to call it an asset class, others a commodity. Bitcoin users call it a currency and many advocate for its mass adoption, claiming it can help solve problems created by expensive and time-consuming bank transactions.  Early adopters also liked the anonymity bitcoin has offered, since it can be transferred between users without any exchange of personal identification information. However, moves by various authorities to pursue bitcoin users who they say have laundered money using the currency and attempts to regulate bitcoin exchanges could soon lower the level of anonymity in transactions.  On Tuesday, Slovenia-based Bitstamp became the second major bitcoin exchange to halt customer withdrawals in the past several days, citing “inconsistent results” and blaming a denial-of-service attack.  That was a day after Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo and the best-known digital marketplace operator, said a halt on withdrawals would continue indefinitely. Traders reacted to the halt by sending the bitcoin value to its lowest level in nearly two months.  A Bulgaria-based bitcoin exchange also had to halt withdrawals, Antonopoulos said.  The price of bitcoins, which have gained wider acceptance in recent months, dropped in the wake of the attacks from around $850 late last month. On Wednesday, they were quoted down nearly 2 percent for the day at $656 per coin on the bitcoin tracking website CoinDesk.  “Anyone who plays in this space, you better have a plan for when an attack happens because it’s going to be a when, not an if,” said Brian Krebs, a Washington-based cyber security expert who runs the blog KrebsOnSecurity.com.  The lesson for investors was that the bitcoin wasn’t as liquid as initially advertised, said Jason Scharfman, a financial due diligence expert and managing partner at consulting firm Corgentum.  “These types of attacks, they’re effectively freezing some of the accounts because the exchanges don’t want to pay out to the wrong person,” he said. “If something’s frozen or there’s a question about me being able to redeem my bitcoins, the value of them drops.”  “Does this spook financial investors?” he added. “The answer is yes.”  Scharfman said one way to mitigate the risks of such attacks would be to spread holdings of bitcoins out among several different online storage facilities. That way if one were attacked the other might still have a chance at being safe.  Scharfman said the more regulatory scrutiny that bitcoin exchanges received, the safer they were likely to be.  “Regulation will sort of normalize which exchanges are the most secure. They’ll mandate security measures and smaller exchanges just won’t be able to afford it,” he said.  Reporting by Emily Flitter; Editing by Leslie Adler",-0.017358333333333326,0.06415105920314253

Bitcoin has seen eye-watering gains in recent months, having more than doubled in value in the past seven weeks alone. It is on track for a fifth consecutive quarter of increases — a run not seen since 2012-2013, when it was approaching $100 for the first time.    It hit as high as $7,354.10 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday BTC=BTSP, before settling back to $7,030 by 1630 GMT, still up over 4 percent on the day.   Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam expressed caution about the booming cryptocurrency, saying the current interest in it could eventually subside.  “From what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,” he said on Thursday.  The latest rally was driven in large part by news earlier this week that the world’s largest derivatives exchange operator CME Group (CME.O) is to launch bitcoin futures.  “The move by such a well-known, established exchange throws open the doors for institutions to get into bitcoin,” said analyst Arnaud Masset at Swissquote, a brokerage that offers bitcoin trading to retail clients.   “Still, traditional investors will remain cautious and will not rush.”  Thursday’s price move took bitcoin’s aggregate value or “market cap” — its price multiplied by the number of bitcoins released into circulation — to more than $122 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.   The aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies hit a record high of more than $194 billion, the website said, more than the market values of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined.   “This has been another incredibly bullish week for the cryptocurrency, with the visible upside attracting investors from all directions,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, a brokerage.   “It must be kept in mind that bitcoin’s exponential gains are not only phenomenal, but (also) somewhat frightening.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Catherine Evans",0.27564166666666673,0.19623015873015873

Unlike conventional fiat money and other digital currencies, Bitcoin runs through a peer-to-peer network, independent of central control. Bitcoins are currently worth $4.88 each on online currency exchanges, where they can be bought and sold for about 15 world currencies.  Users - an odd assortment of uber-geeks, anarchists, libertarians, scammers and forex traders - sent about $4.3 million worth to each other in the last 24 hours.  Banking and payment expert Simon Lelieveldt believes they are living on borrowed time.  “There is always a power base underlying a currency,” he said, speaking at the Digital Money Forum in London in March.  “Bitcoin is not going to fly because there is no central bank or power base. It’s doomed to fail.”  But its separation from power is precisely what attracts many users.  “Bitcoin is not run by people with hot sexual appetites for hotel maids. It is not run by corporations. It is not governed by people with budgets to meet. It is governed by a mathematical formula,” one trader and Bitcoin enthusiast told Reuters over a pint of Guinness in London’s financial district.  He also likes that there is an absolute limit of 21 million Bitcoins built into the system.  “If you try to print more than 21 million Bitcoins, you will be rejected by cold, loveless computers whirring away in nerds’ garages. It is a better form of money than we have right now, or than anyone has designed so far.”  The trader, who was not willing to be named, said he spent four hours a day on Bitcoin, describing it as his second job. He estimated 90 percent of traders have bought it, most “looking for a quick 2,000 percent”.  He, however, is playing the long game, accumulating as much as possible in the belief that one day, he will own a small but significant percentage of a world currency with a fixed supply.  He and three other traders are currently seeking Bitcoin startups to invest in, he said, adding he was hoping to put in $300,000 worth.  He is not alone. Workers at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in London and New York have been visiting online Bitcoin exchanges as often as 30 times a day, according to documents seen by Reuters. Neither bank wanted to comment.  Employees at almost all the major international banks and numerous trading and investment firms have shown interest.  Bitcoin has become the Wild West of finance, with a proliferation of websites offering loosely regulated replicas of the services familiar to those in the financial industry.  There is a Bitcoin stock exchange, where companies can make initial public offerings and pay dividends in Bitcoin.  One website offering Bitcoin options trading was ‘listed’ this month for an implied valuation of half a million dollars.  Perhaps the most notorious is Bitcoinica, a platform offering margin trading, short selling and stop orders run by 17-year-old Chinese high school student Zhou Tong.  Users can leverage their bets up to a ratio of 10:1 on Bitcoinica, meaning they can lose more than their initial investment.  Zhou Tong, who is professionally advised by a forex trader and the head of a Singapore-based algorithmic trading firm, now lends his name to international slang.  To be “Zhou Tonged” is to be wiped out financially.  The chorus of a YouTube rap laments a Bitcoin day trader rash enough to hold a position with no stop loss protection: “It’s so silly, how come you just lost funds? You got Zhou Tonged!”  THE ANTI-BANK SYSTEM  Its popularity with financial professionals highlights an irony at the heart of the Bitcoin usership; suspicion of the banking system is written into the program’s DNA.  It was released in January 2009 by a developer using the probable pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Embedded in the code of its first block of transaction history are the words ‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’.  This was a way of time-stamping the first Bitcoin transaction, but also a clue to the developer’s motivation.  Before disappearing as an online presence in January 2010, Nakamoto made clear his disapproval of quantitative easing measures and blamed banks for creating credit bubbles.  Such sentiments are common among users.  “There are no bailouts of banks on Bitcoin,” one put it.  The Greek owner of an island bar and restaurant who accepts payment in Bitcoin alongside euros told Reuters he liked the currency because it was the opposite of a banking system.  “I don’t put money in the banks,” said Gerald, who did not give his surname. “I trust the euro as a note, but I don’t trust banks. I don’t want them making money out of my earnings.”  Digital money consultant Jon Matonis, former head forex trader at Visa, said Bitcoin was a natural fit for societies that prefer cash payments.  “Try tell the Italians that they can’t use cash any more. Try tell the Greeks!” he said.  Bitcoin payments are difficult to trace back to a person’s identity, offering an anonymity that protects users from data-mining by advertising companies, but also facilitates illicit trade and has obvious potential for money launderers.  The currency gained notoriety alongside a website named Silk Road, where vendors offer to send heroin, LSD, or 9mm Beretta handguns in the post in exchange for Bitcoin.  Yet there are signs Bitcoin is finding a niche among ordinary people for everyday, legitimate transactions.  One British businessman in China said he regularly used it to deal with businesses in Asia, Europe and the Americas because of local restrictions on sending currency to foreign companies.  “I’ve been able to have cash in my bank account in a matter of hours using Bitcoin, rather than three days with traditional banking,” he said.  Quietly, a growing list of businesses are starting to accept it for a wide range of goods, from legal services to food.  Matonis says it could be a perfect ‘digital poker chip’ for online gambling and a competitive way for immigrants to send money back home.  Bitcoin poses a puzzle for regulators. It does not fit the UK Financial Services Authority’s definition of e-money as it is not issued on the receipt of funds, according to an FSA response to a Bitcoin business that requested to be regulated in the UK.  But the creation of Bitcoin could amount to “issuing payment instruments” as long as Bitcoins in fact count as money, which is “if and when they become widely used”, the FSA concluded.  A spokeswoman for the German Bundesbank told Reuters it was not classifying Bitcoins as e-currency.  She said EU law required only euros to be accepted as legal tender, but this was superseded by German law that allows those involved in a contract to determine its content. So Bitcoin is at least not illegal there.  The situation in the United States is even more complex, where financial regulation differs from state to state.  As Bitcoin is a huge distributed peer-to-peer system, any effort to enforce regulation would be difficult, though the exchanges, where Bitcoin is swapped for real-world currency, are potentially vulnerable.  A legal precedent could come from France, where the biggest online exchange, Mt Gox, is in dispute with Credit Mutuel’s Credit Industriel et Commercial.  Mt Gox sued CIC after the bank closed its account. CIC said the company was illegally behaving as a financial intermediary and that using their account made the bank an accomplice, according to court documents.  The court told the bank to reopen the account and compensate Mt Gox, but it was unable to determine whether Bitcoin is a virtual currency under French law and thus subject to relevant regulation. It has referred the question to another court.  “If exchanges which are trying to walk the path of legality are being closed, then less law-friendly exchanges will thrive,” commented Mt Gox head Mark Karpeles.  “This won’t stop Bitcoin. It may just kill any chance Bitcoin has to become a clean way of paying merchants, friends and family.”  Credit Mutuel declined to comment on the ongoing case.  The existence of Bitcoin is also an economic puzzle, raising questions about the definition of money itself.  Its value depends on users’ belief that it is worth something. So does all money, but in the case of Bitcoin this faith could be more fragile.  It also runs up against standard economic theory that people will not spend money if they expect it to increase in value; the 21 million limit means once all Bitcoins are in circulation, there are no internal inflationary pressures to devalue it.  More of a threat is the tsunami of other digital forms of money that are beginning to be offered by states and companies.  The Royal Canadian Mint, for example, is exploring how to issue digital currency in the future. Its chief financial officer Marc Brule said Bitcoin’s biggest problem was that it is not backed by anything.  “The system we would bring in would be backed by a fund,” he told Reuters. “Bitcoin may work for the small group of people that believe in its value, but that could change very suddenly.”  Without that backing or a similar power base, Bitcoin lives with the ever-present risk of failure.  “To be clear, I would say the same about the euro,” said payment expert Lelieveldt.",0.06993333333333333,0.04508810633810634
345,Lead developer quits bitcoin saying it 'has failed',https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0UT2II,"January 15, 2016 04:28pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid by 10 percent on Friday after one of its lead developers, Mike Hearn, said in a blogpost that he was ending his involvement with the cryptocurrency and selling all of his remaining holdings because it had “failed”.  Hearn, one of five senior developers who has spent more than five years working on the web-based currency, said he would no longer be taking part in development.  “Despite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly,” Hearn said in his post on blog-publishing platform Medium.   Along with Gavin Andresen, who was chosen by bitcoin’s elusive creator Satoshi Nakamoto as his successor when he stepped aside in 2011, Hearn has been locked for months in a battle with the other lead developers over whether the “blocks” in which bitcoin transactions are processed should be enlarged.  Each block currently has a capacity of one megabyte, which Hearn says is “an entirely artificial capacity cap”, and allows a maximum of just three payments to be processed per second.      In August, Hearn and Andresen released a rival version of the current software, called Bitcoin XT, which would increase the block size to 8 megabytes, allowing up to 24 transactions to be processed every second. While that is still a fraction of the 20,000 or so that Visa can process, it would increase every year, so that bitcoin could continue to grow.  But the new software has not been adopted by the “mining” computers that secure the network, the majority of which are in China, according to Hearn.   Hearn says the bitcoin network is about to run out of capacity as the volume of transactions increases. And when that happens, the network will become unreliable, with payments unable to be processed and vulnerable to fraud.  “If an IT system runs out of capacity like that then all kinds of things go wrong – all hell breaks loose,” he said in an interview with Reuters in late December.   Hearn reckons the bitcoin community has “failed” in its governance of the crytocurrency’s code.   “What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people,” he wrote.   Just months ago, in August, Hearn told Reuters that whether or not Bitcoin XT was adopted, the crypocurrency would live on. “If we thought it might be the end of bitcoin, we wouldn’t do it,” he said then.       Bitcoin was trading at around $390 on the itBit exchange BTC=ITBT by 2000 GMT, down from $430 before Hearn's blog post was published.   In his December interview, Hearn said that when people realised that the bitcoin network was at breaking point, the price would fall.    “The current price of bitcoin is supported almost entirely by people speculating on its future, in the assumption that this could be the money of tomorrow,” he said. “So if the network starts to collapse, then a lot of people are going to look at it and say: well maybe we’ve miscalculated (its) future value.”   Hearn is now working for the R3CEV consortium of banks working on using the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin in financial markets.  Stephan Tual, the former chief operating officer of blockchain firm Ethereum, who now works at blockchain-based app developer Slock.it, also reckons bitcoin’s future looks shaky.   “Bitcoin is outdated technology - almost prehistoric by crypto standards,” he said. “It’s because of petty quarrels such as these that it hasn’t been able to evolve in five years.”   Others were more upbeat.  “I’m not ready to declare that Bitcoin has failed,” wrote U.S. venture capitalist Fred Wilson.   “Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room... So if we are going to have a crisis, let’s get on with it. No better time than the present.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Ruth Pitchford",-0.17592962962962963,-0.0890342168119946

It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but have yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com.  The Bank of France said the price of bitcoin in legal currencies was inherently volatile and users may find it difficult to convert to real money.  The anonymity that bitcoin offer users also raises the risk that they could also be used for money-laundering and financing of terrorism, the central bank said in a publication.  “Even if bitcoin is not currently a credible investment vehicle and therefore do not pose a significant risk to financial stability, they represent a financial risk for those who hold them,” the Bank of France said.  Though the central bank saw no threat to its monopoly on the issuance of legal tender, bitcoin’s growing popularity has increasingly attracted the attention of authorities in several countries, including China and the United States.  The Chinese central bank warned financial institutions on Thursday against trading bitcoin, which has proven particularly popular in China.  The price of the digital currency rose over $1,000 last month for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble in the making.

Unlike conventional fiat money and other digital currencies, Bitcoin runs through a peer-to-peer network, independent of central control. Bitcoins are currently worth $4.88 each on online currency exchanges, where they can be bought and sold for about 15 world currencies.

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.  On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.  It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.  Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.  Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.   “As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.  Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.   But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.  “China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.  “As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.   Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.  A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year. Bitcoins and ether, another digital currency, are used to purchase tokens for ICOs.

But the new software has not been adopted by the “mining” computers that secure the network, the majority of which are in China, according to Hearn.   Hearn says the bitcoin network is about to run out of capacity as the volume of transactions increases. And when that happens, the network will become unreliable, with payments unable to be processed and vulnerable to fraud.  “If an IT system runs out of capacity like that then all kinds of things go wrong – all hell breaks loose,” he said in an interview with Reuters in late December.   Hearn reckons the bitcoin community has “failed” in its governance of the crytocurrency’s code.   “What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people,” he wrote.   Just months ago, in August, Hearn told Reuters that whether or not Bitcoin XT was adopted, the crypocurrency would live on. “If we thought it might be the end of bitcoin, we wouldn’t do it,” he said then.       Bitcoin was trading at around $390 on the itBit exchange BTC=ITBT by 2000 GMT, down from $430 before Hearn's blog post was published.   In his December interview, Hearn said that when people realised that the bitcoin network was at breaking point, the price would fall.    “The current price of bitcoin is supported almost entirely by people speculating on its future, in the assumption that this could be the money of tomorrow,” he said. “So if the network starts to collapse, then a lot of people are going to look at it and say: well maybe we’ve miscalculated (its) future value.”   Hearn is now working for the R3CEV consortium of banks working on using the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin in financial markets.  Stephan Tual, the former chief operating officer of blockchain firm Ethereum, who now works at blockchain-based app developer Slock.it, also reckons bitcoin’s future looks shaky.   “Bitcoin is outdated technology - almost prehistoric by crypto standards,” he said. “It’s because of petty quarrels such as these that it hasn’t been able to evolve in five years.”   Others were more upbeat.  “I’m not ready to declare that Bitcoin has failed,” wrote U.S. venture capitalist Fred Wilson.   “Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room... So if we are going to have a crisis, let’s get on with it. No better time than the present.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Ruth Pitchford",-0.17592962962962963,-0.0890342168119946
353,Texan pleads guilty to running bitcoin Ponzi scheme,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N11R0WQ20150921,"September 21, 2015 04:43pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - A Texas man accused of operating a Ponzi scheme involving bitcoins pleaded guilty on Monday in what prosecutors say was the first U.S. criminal securities fraud case related to the digital currency.  Trendon Shavers, who authorities said defrauded investors after raising more than $4.5 million worth of bitcoins while operating Bitcoin Savings and Trust, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of securities fraud.  “I know what I did was wrong, and I’m very sorry,” Shavers said in court.  Under a plea deal, Shavers has agreed not to appeal any sentence at or below 41 months in prison. Sentencing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled for Feb. 3.  Shavers, who went by “pirateat40” online, was arrested in November, two months after a federal judge in Texas ordered him to pay $40.7 million in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit.  Prosecutors said Shavers, who turned 33 on Monday, raised at least 764,000 bitcoins worth more than $4.5 million based on the average price of bitcoin during the period of the scheme from investors from September 2011 to September 2012. He promised interest rates of 7 percent per week or 3,641 percent a year.  The indictment said Shavers solicited the investments on the website Bitcoin Forum, offering to pay interest to investors who loaned bitcoins to Bitcoin Savings and Trust while he pursued a market arbitrage strategy.  Michael Ferrara, a prosecutor, in court on Monday said Shavers had invested some of the bitcoins with Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Tokoyo-based bitcoin exchange.  But Ferrara said Shavers, who lived in McKinney, Texas, largely instead used new investors’ bitcoins to pay back prior investors.  “In other words, he had the telltale signs of a Ponzi scheme,” Ferrara said.  In court papers, prosecutors had also accused Shavers of misappropriating bitcoins to buy a used BMW M5 sedan and a $1,000 steakhouse dinner in Las Vegas, and to go to spas and casinos.  At the peak of the scheme, Shavers controlled about 7 percent of bitcoins in public circulation, prosecutors said. In total, prosecutors said he misappropriated 146,000 bitcoins and caused 48 investors to suffer losses.  The case is U.S. v.

The rejection of two of the biggest names in the bitcoin industry is a potentially encouraging sign for the long-term prospects of the crypto-currency because this means the auction drew a lot of interest from other institutional as well as new investors.  Pantera Capital chief executive officer Dan Morehead told Reuters the firm was not able to purchase the bitcoins because their bid was below the market price.  “The point is when this auction was announced, bitcoin was trading at $634 and the general view was that the supply would take the price down,” Morehead said.  “But ultimately, the supply increased the demand for bitcoins and now the price was higher than when the auction was announced.”  On Friday, the U.S. Marshals Service auctioned off about 30,000 bitcoins seized during a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar where authorities say illegal drugs and other goods could be bought. The Marshals Service said it was notifying winners on Monday evening.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service said on Monday the 12-hour auction for about $17.7 million in bitcoin drew 45 registered bidders and received 63 bids but would not disclose  the bidding price of the coins.  “The award process is ongoing, and we will have no further announcements today,” said Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service.  Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive officer of    SecondMarket Holdings, which runs a bitcoin investment platform, confirmed in an email to Reuters on Monday that he tweeted earlier his firm had been outbid for the bitcoin auction on all blocks. Silbert had made no secret of his desire to bid in the auction, so his firm being outbid suggested interest was likely strong.  Bitcoin prices were up 6.8 percent on Monday at $639.32, according to the digital currency exchange CoinDesk. The currency’s price rose late in the afternoon in advance of expectations for the sale’s results.  “The bitcoins that were auctioned off would be in good hands,” said George Samman, chief operating officer, at BTC.sx, a bitcoin derivatives trading platform.  “The investors will provide the stability to the industry and reduce volatility in the market. These people will probably hold the bitcoin over the long haul and that’s good for the industry.”  Bitcoin is a virtual currency that has gained a following but also has come under scrutiny due to scams related to virtual currencies. However, its acceptance has grown, with satellite operator Dish and online travel agency Expedia recently saying they would accept payment in bitcoin.  Among those who said they registered to participate in the auctions were Bitcoin Shop Inc. and Coinbase. Both declined to comment.  Silbert had attracted a group of investors interested in getting a share of the bitcoin auction by offering lower bid sizes and a reduced upfront commitment. In a tweet last week he said he received 186 bids from 42 bidders.  Silk Road was shut after an FBI raid in September 2013 as agents took control of its server and arrested a Texas man, Ross Ulbricht, that the authorities said owned and operated the website. The auction was for 29,655 bitcoins contained in files residing on its servers, which were forfeited in January.

355,Bitcoin bank Flexcoin shuts after hacking theft,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2329B20140305,"March 05, 2014 03:26am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - Flexcoin, a Canada-based bitcoin bank, said it was closing down after losing bitcoins worth about $600,000 to a hacker attack enabled by flaws in its software code.  Flexcoin said in a message on its website that all 896 bitcoins stored online were stolen on Sunday. Its collapse came after Mt. Gox, once the world’s dominant bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan and said it may have lost some 850,000 bitcoins due to hacking.  ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately,"" Flexcoin said. (r.reuters.com/web47v)  It later posted an update on its site saying that the attack exploited a flaw in its code on transfers between users and involved inundating the system with simultaneous requests to move coins between accounts.  “Flexcoin has made every attempt to keep our servers as secure as possible, including regular testing,” it said, adding it had repelled thousands of attacks over the past few years. “But in the end, this was simply not enough.”  The Alberta, Canada-based firm, which said it is working with law enforcement agencies to trace the source of the hack, said it would return bitcoins stored offline, or in “cold storage”, to users.  Cold storage coins are held in computers not connected to the internet and therefore cannot be hacked.  Flexcoin said on February 25 it was not affected by Mt. Gox’s closure. “While the Mt. Gox closure is unfortunate, we at Flexcoin have not lost anything,” it had tweeted then.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional money, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion.  According to Bitstamp, one of the largest exchanges for trading bitcoins, a bitcoin was valued at about $658 on Wednesday.

According to sources, the deal was valued at $2 million, marking the first merger deal in the growing bitcoin exchange market.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive officer of Coinsetter, will become the CEO of Cavirtex. The transaction was an all-stock deal, Lukasiewicz told Reuters, although he declined to give the total value.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency created through a “mining” process where a computer’s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. It has been hailed as revolutionary by the currency’s advocates because of its lack of ties to a central bank and its potential as an alternative to credit cards to pay for goods and services.  Lukasiewicz said Coinsetter chief technology officer Marshall Swatt reached out to Cavirtex “just kind of on a hunch and it evolved form there.”  Cavirtex shut down in March following a breach that compromised security information including password hashes. Lukasiewicz said the exchange would resume operation later on Wednesday.  “We saw a lot of assets in Cavirtex not only in terms of entering the Canadian market, but being a leader in it,” he said. “But probably the most important asset was the exchange’s compliance-approved domestic bank account in Canada.”  He said banking relationships had become difficult to obtain for bitcoin companies and “bitcoin exchanges have become the connecting point between the traditional banking institutions and the bitcoin ecosystem.”   Coinsetter has an average daily volume of 1,200 bitcoins, or just over $290,000.  “(We) will create a ...

357,Think bitcoin's getting expensive? Try Zimbabwe,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1N92PQ,"November 13, 2017 02:00am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"HARARE (Reuters) - For most investors around the world, bitcoin is a volatile and highly speculative bet. For Zimbabweans, however, the cryptocurrency seems to offer rare protection from the onset of hyperinflation and financial implosion.  Some are turning to bitcoin out of desperation as their bank deposits lose value almost by the day, while others are using the online currency for housekeeping such as funding family members studying abroad.   The result is startling. Bitcoin's BTC=BTSP global surge to a record high of $7,888 last week - a sevenfold increase since the start of the year - has been spectacular enough. But on Harare's bitcoin exchange, Golix (golix.io), the price hit $13,900, a 40-fold jump in the same period.  Warnings abound internationally that bitcoin may be a bubble waiting to burst. But the dire state of the Zimbabwean financial system under President Robert Mugabe is encouraging risk-taking.  “I have now changed all my reserves to bitcoin because that is the only way I can protect my investment,” said Arnold Manhizwa, who works for an IT and telecoms company in Harare.  The government adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009 after a bout of hyperinflation rendered the Zimbabwean dollar worthless, wiping out savings in the now defunct national currency.   After a period of relative stability, acute shortages of dollar cash have set in, leaving Zimbabweans with electronic units in their bank accounts which are officially called dollars but have a far lower - and rapidly decreasing - value.  In January if they wanted to buy $100 in cash they had to transfer $120 out of their account to a seller on the parallel market. Now the price is $180 in what are nicknamed “zollars”.  GRAPHIC: Devalued zollars tmsnrt.rs/2mwbtLU  Nearly all domestic transactions are made via debit card or transfers using mobile phones. But some economists estimate inflation is more than 50 percent a month in zollar terms, far from the official, dollar-calculated rate of 0.38 percent.  Zimbabweans are therefore piling into anything they think might retain value. Prices of cars, real estate and stocks have all soared, with the Harare bourse's main industrial index .INDZI doubling in the last two months.  For people like Manhizwa, a 34-year-old father of two, bitcoin is almost a safe-haven asset. “If I have $500 in the bank I won’t get it back and I will be losing value, but when I have my bitcoin it is going up every day,” he told Reuters.  Manhizwa, who participates in online chatrooms discussing cryptocurrencies, says he deposited $20 in bitcoin for his newly-born daughter a few months ago. Now it’s worth over $200. “If I put that money in a bank right now in Zimbabwe I will be left with nothing,” he said.  Globally, the value of all cryptocurrencies is more than $170 billion and bitcoin, the biggest and best-known, has outperformed all traditional currencies every year since 2011, except for 2014. But many international investors still view it as an opaque instrument used by gun-runners and drug-dealers on the Dark Web that should be avoided.  The risks are clear. After reaching the record peak, the international price of bitcoin slid over $1,000 in less than 48 hours last week. In Zimbabwe, the Golix exchange’s website showed at one point on Sunday that the price had tumbled below $11,000, a drop of around eight percent in 24 hours.  But all this has to be compared with the zollar. “Many people view bitcoin, despite its volatile nature, as a better store of value,” said in-house Golix cryptocurrency analyst Taurai Chinyamakobvu.  The same is true in other financially troubled countries such as Venezuela, where the currency has also been eroded by rocketing inflation, pushing bitcoin prices sharply higher.  In Zimbabwe, bitcoin’s attraction looks set to endure after Mugabe fired vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, paving the way for his wife, Grace, to get to the front of the queue to succeed the 93-year-old.      Mnangagwa had been given a mandate by Mugabe in 2015 to steer the economy and had backed former finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who was trying to re-engage with foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund.  Besides acting as an inflation hedge, bitcoin’s attraction to Zimbabweans lies in the difficulty of making foreign payments due to banks capping or halting transactions by Mastercard and Visa cards.      With bitcoin, Zimbabweans can bypass the need to seek foreign currency from the bank, and can even buy goods or services from the growing number of overseas merchants that accept the digital currency.  The central bank, which has to approve official overseas transactions and prioritizes necessities such as fuel and medicines, has previously said Zimbabwe had a backlog of more than $500 million in pending foreign payments.  “A software developer that wants to buy a software download would never get that prioritized by their bank. They can use bitcoin to make payments,” Golix said in response to Reuters questions. “Others use it to send funds to their children in schools outside the country.”   Some better-off families send their sons and daughters for secondary and university education in countries such as South Africa or Britain but they are struggling to support them due to the currency shortage.      Golix data shows it handled bitcoin transactions worth $1 million in October.   But it is a market from which foreigners are largely absent. Technically, overseas-based investors could buy bitcoin on the international market and sell them for almost twice the price in Zimbabwe. The snag is that payment would be in zollars.  One analyst who is setting up a bitcoin trading desk at a Harare bank acknowledged that the local price appeared attractive, but added: “Once foreigners sell their bitcoin, they won’t have a way of getting their money out.”  Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Ed Cropley and David Stamp",0.05431590909090909,0.04454491341991342

The partnership between Payward and Mt. Gox was approved by the Tokyo district court on Wednesday. Kraken will not be paid for the arrangement but could win new clients as former account holders at Mt. Gox register to receive future distributions from the liquidation.   “We hope to revive bitcoin’s reputation and create a healthy market for it, ultimately leading to profit for us,” Ayako Miyaguchi, managing director of Kraken’s Japanese operations,　told reporters.

Gox also said $28 million were “missing” from its Japanese bank accounts.  Karpeles later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins.  The collapse of Mt. Gox was a setback for a five-year-old virtual currency that proponents see as a still-developing alternative to traditional money.

362,Bitcoin flounders in Australia as regulatory worries bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N11V2B420151004,"October 03, 2015 11:00pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"* Australian banks closed accounts of 13 bitcoin exchanges  * Businesses wary of currency’s potential crime links  * Australia estimated to hold 7 percent of bitcoin’s global value  By Byron Kaye and Swati Pandey  SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Australian businesses are turning their backs on bitcoin, as signs grow that the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal is fading.  Concerns about bitcoin’s potential crime links mean many businesses have stopped accepting it, a trend accelerated by Australian banks’ move last month to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.  The development is a blow to hopes of bitcoin fans that the currency can play a significant role in everyday business transactions in developed economies, with Australia once seen as one of its most promising markets. It is estimated to hold 7 percent of the currency’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.  “We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which ditched the currency in late 2014 after the firm was investigated by the federal tax office.  Forsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees via bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe found no wrongdoing but Forsyth was burned by the negative publicity and bailed out before ever taking a bitcoin payment.  Although most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. already refuse to keep bitcoin-affiliated accounts, developments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system.  The move makes it much harder for people to convert regular currencies in to or out of bitcoin, threatening its long-term value.  “It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer Adrian Lee.  The banks’ shutdown appears at odds with a government inquiry which in August recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin. The Australian anti-money laundering agency, AUSTRAC, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.  The so-called “Big Four” banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank  - directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.  Tony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, wouldn’t confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said in an email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base”.  Australia’s organised crime agency has said it is concerned the currency’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and selling illicit drugs.  In the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but lack of industry co-ordination has left room for individual lenders to support the currency, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and tech-focused Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank.  The 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.  The remaining four have had their accounts frozen, and now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into several smaller bank accounts to avoid detection by their banks.  Buyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining four exchanges, said it is still considering its options.  “It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange.  Smith declined to identify which bank his firm is now using from fear of repercussions but said he plans to move the business offshore.  Two sources told Reuters that regional lender Bank of Queensland still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite” but did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.  Some industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.  At least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, told Reuters they were considering exiting the currency.  “If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of off-road vehicle maker Tomcar Australia, which has sold one car using bitcoin since introducing it in November 2014.  Grant Fairweather, owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when a group of digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.  “They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather, who sells about A$100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.  An online clothing retailer told Reuters she had made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013 and asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it”.

363,"Bitcoin price zooms through $1,000 as enthusiasm grows",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9AQ0YR20131127,"November 27, 2013 02:28pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The price of the digital currency bitcoin soared above $1,000 for the first time on Wednesday, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month that some see as a growing bubble in an asset that is still a mystery to many.  Bitcoin hit a high of $1,073 on Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the best-known operator of a bitcoin digital marketplace, compared with just below $900 the previous day.  At the beginning of the month, bitcoin, a prominent digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank, traded at around $215. The spike in its price has some believing that it has become overvalued in a short period of time, owing to its limited supply and increasing demand.  “A narrow asset class and lots of liquidity is the perfect environment for a rapid burst up in value, and then corrections,” said Sebastien Galy, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.  Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day, every day. The supply of the currency, which is “mined” by solving math problems, is limited, and recently stood at 12 million bitcoins, worth about $12.9 billion at recent prices.  Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets and is not run by any person or group. Its value depends on people’s confidence in the currency. It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but has yet to become an accepted form of payment on the websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com.  Earlier in the month, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on virtual currencies, with some officials expressing concern that it is notable for its use in criminal activity and that there is a lack of regulatory oversight.  But bitcoin advocates say last week’s Senate hearing gave more legitimacy to the currency, in part fueling the gains.  “It isn’t just the bitcoin community saying that bitcoin is used for good things and there’s a lot of great potential. We have members of Congress and government agencies who all agree,” said Jinyoung Lee Englund, spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation in Washington.  Bitcoin is valued by many users for its anonymity. But government officials expressed concerns that many virtual currency services do not have the proper controls in place to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering.  “Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others and confused the heck out of the rest of us,” Senator Thomas Carper told the Senate Homeland Security Committee earlier this month.  In October, federal authorities shut down an online marketplace called Silk Road that was used for purchasing drugs and hiring hit men. Authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road.  More than 200 bitcoin businesses and other merchants are participating in a bitcoin Black Friday shopping event, where users can buy everything from airplane tickets to Christmas trees to organic beer.

364,Australia to auction $11.5 million confiscated bitcoins,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0YL091,"May 29, 2016 11:59pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Around A$16 million ($11.49 million) worth of confiscated bitcoins will be auctioned in Sydney next month, the first such auction outside the United States, as demand for the digital currency surged to its highest in nearly two years.  The sale will take place on June 20-21 and involve 24,518 coins, said auction organizer financial services group Ernst and Young on Monday.   U.S. Marshals auctioned off more than 170,000 bitcoins in 2014 and 2015, confiscated after the closure of Silk Road, a black market website.   Bitcoin has proved popular among users of underground market places and criminals because transactions are anonymous and need not involve any formal institution.   Ernst and Young said the bitcoin was “confiscated as proceeds of crime” but declined to identify its client. Local news reports have previously said that the bitcoin was confiscated from an Australian man convicted of commercial drug trafficking in 2014.   A spokesperson for the department of justice in Victoria state declined to comment, citing commercial considerations.    EY partner Adam Nikitins said the company expects interest from asset investment managers, currency exchanges, investment banks and hedge funds in North America and Europe.  “The number of bitcoin transactions since 2012 has quadrupled and parties are seeing more opportunities and uses for the technology,” said Nikitins.  The auction is not limited to Australian nationals. On Friday, the price of bitcoin rose to $530, the highest level since August 2014. Trades involving the Chinese yuan are estimated to account for as much as 95 percent of bitcoin’s trading volume. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation amounts to around $8 billion.($1 = 1.3930 Australian dollars)  ($1 = 1.3951 Australian dollars)  Reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff; additional reporting by Cecile Lefort in Sydney; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",0.24328999999999995,0.11714285714285717
365,"Lead developer quits bitcoin saying it ""has failed""",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N14Z2S0,"January 15, 2016 04:17pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid by 10 percent on Friday after one of its lead developers, Mike Hearn, said in a blogpost that he was ending his involvement with the cryptocurrency and selling all of his remaining holdings because it had “failed”.  Hearn, one of five senior developers who has spent more than five years working on the web-based currency, said he would no longer be taking part in development.  “Despite knowing that bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly,” Hearn said in his post on blog-publishing platform Medium.   Along with Gavin Andresen, who was chosen by bitcoin’s elusive creator Satoshi Nakamoto as his successor when he stepped aside in 2011, Hearn has been locked for months in a battle with the other lead developers over whether the “blocks” in which bitcoin transactions are processed should be enlarged.  Each block currently has a capacity of one megabyte, which Hearn says is “an entirely artificial capacity cap”, and allows a maximum of just three payments to be processed per second.      In August, Hearn and Andresen released a rival version of the current software, called Bitcoin XT, which would increase the block size to 8 megabytes, allowing up to 24 transactions to be processed every second. While that is still a fraction of the 20,000 or so that Visa can process, it would increase every year, so that bitcoin could continue to grow.  But the new software has not been adopted by the “mining” computers that secure the network, the majority of which are in China, according to Hearn.   Hearn says the bitcoin network is about to run out of capacity as the volume of transactions increases. And when that happens, the network will become unreliable, with payments unable to be processed and vulnerable to fraud.  “If an IT system runs out of capacity like that then all kinds of things go wrong – all hell breaks loose,” he said in an interview with Reuters in late December.   Hearn reckons the bitcoin community has “failed” in its governance of the crytocurrency’s code.   “What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked ‘systemically important institutions’ and ‘too big to fail’ has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people,” he wrote.   Just months ago, in August, Hearn told Reuters that whether or not Bitcoin XT was adopted, the crypocurrency would live on. “If we thought it might be the end of bitcoin, we wouldn’t do it,” he said then.       Bitcoin was trading at around $390 on the itBit exchange BTC=ITBT by 2000 GMT, down from $430 before Hearn's blog post was published.   In his December interview, Hearn said that when people realised that the bitcoin network was at breaking point, the price would fall.    “The current price of bitcoin is supported almost entirely by people speculating on its future, in the assumption that this could be the money of tomorrow,” he said. “So if the network starts to collapse, then a lot of people are going to look at it and say: well maybe we’ve miscalculated (its) future value.”   Hearn is now working for the R3CEV consortium of banks working on using the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin in financial markets.  Stephan Tual, the former chief operating officer of blockchain firm Ethereum, who now works at blockchain-based app developer Slock.it, also reckons bitcoin’s future looks shaky.   “Bitcoin is outdated technology - almost prehistoric by crypto standards,” he said. “It’s because of petty quarrels such as these that it hasn’t been able to evolve in five years.”   Others were more upbeat.  “I’m not ready to declare that Bitcoin has failed,” wrote U.S. venture capitalist Fred Wilson.   “Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room... So if we are going to have a crisis, let’s get on with it. No better time than the present.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Ruth Pitchford",-0.17592962962962963,-0.0890342168119946
366,Canada gold mine on sale for $2 mln in bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0OT13Y20140612,"June 12, 2014 04:25pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"June 12 (Reuters) - Gold, the hard asset long seen as the ultimate hedge against risk, has fallen so much out of favor in recent years that the owner of a mine in Canada’s historic Yukon gold belt wants to sell the property for $2 million in bitcoin, a virtual currency.  The tiny, producing mine is being offered for sale by an unidentified seller on BitPremier, a self-described bitcoin marketplace for “luxury items and opportunities”.  The mine, located right in Dawson City, the heart of the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, has the potential to produce up to 4,000 ounces of gold a year, worth $5.9 million at current prices. The sale includes $1 million worth of equipment.  ""A well-respected, fully compliant and profitable company, any new buyer could recoup their initial investment in as little as two mining seasons,"" the sales advertisement says. It does not say whether the owner would consider any other form of payment besides bitcoins. here  Prices for gold have slumped by a third in the past 2-1/2 years after a decade-long rally, leaving many mines struggling to stay profitable.  Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of so-called virtual currencies created by computers and accepted by some retailers as payment on the Internet or in shops. Enthusiasts are drawn to bitcoin’s ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control, and use the digital currency as a hedge against currency fluctuations. But critics say the near anonymity of transactions makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.  Recent mishaps, including a bankruptcy fling from Mt Gox, a bitcoin exchange, has brought the technology under heightened scrutiny and seen the value of one bitcoin slide to about $610 from above $1,000 late last year.

According to sources, the deal was valued at $2 million, marking the first merger deal in the growing bitcoin exchange market.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive officer of Coinsetter, will become the CEO of Cavirtex. The transaction was an all-stock deal, Lukasiewicz told Reuters, although he declined to give the total value.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency created through a “mining” process where a computer’s resources are used to perform millions of calculations. It has been hailed as revolutionary by the currency’s advocates because of its lack of ties to a central bank and its potential as an alternative to credit cards to pay for goods and services.  Lukasiewicz said Coinsetter chief technology officer Marshall Swatt reached out to Cavirtex “just kind of on a hunch and it evolved form there.”  Cavirtex shut down in March following a breach that compromised security information including password hashes. Lukasiewicz said the exchange would resume operation later on Wednesday.  “We saw a lot of assets in Cavirtex not only in terms of entering the Canadian market, but being a leader in it,” he said. “But probably the most important asset was the exchange’s compliance-approved domestic bank account in Canada.”  He said banking relationships had become difficult to obtain for bitcoin companies and “bitcoin exchanges have become the connecting point between the traditional banking institutions and the bitcoin ecosystem.”  Coinsetter has an average daily volume of 1,200 bitcoins, or just over $290,000.  “(We) will create a ... Canadian bitcoin exchange with low latency trade execution, margin trading and growing interaction with customers through our Toronto office,” said Swatt.

368,SEC says bitcoin funds raise 'investor protection issues',https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F80A0,"January 19, 2018 08:16am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday raised alarm about the safety of bitcoin-themed investments, telling the fund industry they want answers to their concerns before endorsing more than a dozen proposed products based on cryptocurrencies.  A top division chief at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission detailed the agency’s concerns about the wild-trading investment in a letter to two trade groups representing fund managers who unleashed a range of proposals for funds holding bitcoin or related assets.  The SEC’s division of investment management demanded answers to at least 31 detailed questions about how mutual funds or exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin would store, safeguard, and price that asset.  They also asked whether investors can understand the risks and how to address concerns that bitcoin markets could be manipulated. (bit.ly/2DpXsaj)  “There are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to investors,” said the letter signed by Dalia Blass, the SEC’s director of the division of investment management.  Bitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the red-hot asset. A host of companies are jostling to launch exchange-traded funds which would open up the cryptocurrency to a broad retail market.  The SEC in March denied a request to list an ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, owners of the Gemini bitcoin exchange.  The Winklevoss fund is seeking to invest in bitcoin directly. Other fund firms staked their hopes on recently launched U.S.-listed bitcoin futures contracts, which promised a more stable base for ETFs than the largely unregulated virtual currency spot market. Many of those proposals were withdrawn last week at the request of the SEC.  Bitcoin was last down a fraction of a percent for the day at $11,228 on the Bitstamp exchange, but it has tumbled more than 40 percent from its peak in December.  Jeremy Senderowicz, a lawyer who represented one proposal for a cryptocurrency product before the SEC, said the SEC statement is a “really big deal” by making public concerns that fund managers would have had to address on a case-by-case basis, behind the scenes.  “It shows that they’re going to have to take some time to consider the industry’s responses before they change their minds on it,” said Senderowicz, a partner at Dechert LLP.  “It gives a template for how to get to a yes.”  Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Jacqueline Wong",0.11146470588235294,0.08557384064737006
369,Bitcoin flounders in Australia as regulatory worries bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0RY02H20151004,"October 03, 2015 11:29pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian businesses are turning their backs on bitcoin, as signs grow that the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal is fading.       Concerns about bitcoin’s potential crime links mean many businesses have stopped accepting it, a trend accelerated by Australian banks’ move last month to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.  The development is a blow to hopes of bitcoin fans that the currency can play a significant role in everyday business transactions in developed economies, with Australia once seen as one of its most promising markets. It is estimated to hold 7 percent of the currency’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.      “We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which ditched the currency in late 2014 after the firm was investigated by the federal tax office.      Forsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees via bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe found no wrongdoing but Forsyth was burned by the negative publicity and bailed out before ever taking a bitcoin payment.  Although most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. already refuse to keep bitcoin-affiliated accounts, developments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system.  The move makes it much harder for people to convert regular currencies in to or out of bitcoin, threatening its long-term value.   “It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer Adrian Lee.  The banks’ shutdown appears at odds with a government inquiry which in August recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin. The Australian anti-money laundering agency, AUSTRAC, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.  The so-called “Big Four” banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank - directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.  Tony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, wouldn’t confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said in an email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base”.  Australia’s organized crime agency has said it is concerned the currency’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and selling illicit drugs.  In the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but lack of industry co-ordination has left room for individual lenders to support the currency, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and tech-focused Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank.  The 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.   The remaining four have had their accounts frozen, and now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into several smaller bank accounts to avoid detection by their banks.   Buyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining four exchanges, said it is still considering its options.   “It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange.  Smith declined to identify which bank his firm is now using from fear of repercussions but said he plans to move the business offshore.  Two sources told Reuters that regional lender Bank of Queensland still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite” but did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.  Some industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.    At least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, told Reuters they were considering exiting the currency.  “If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of off-road vehicle maker Tomcar Australia, which has sold one car using bitcoin since introducing it in November 2014.  Grant Fairweather, owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when a group of digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.   “They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather, who sells about A$100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.  An online clothing retailer told Reuters she had made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013 and asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it”.

Sheng Songcheng, adviser to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), made the comments in an interview with financial magazine Yicai published late Thursday.  “Bitcoin does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency as it is a string of code generated by complex algorithms...But I do not deny that virtual currencies have technical value and are a type of asset,” he said.  His comments come after the Chinese central bank increased scrutiny of the country’s bitcoin exchanges earlier this year, a move that prompted the companies to stop margin lending, introduced trading fees and issue rules to rein in users.  Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000. China has classified it as a “virtual good”.  Squaring in on bitcoin, Sheng said expectations that bitcoin supply would be capped in the year 2140 would make it difficult for it to become a medium of exchange that could meet modern economic development needs as money supply should be related to economic needs.  He also said that Chinese monetary authorities should study issuing a central bank virtual currency that it could regulate and run properly.

371,Bitcoin trading shrivels under Chinese government's glare,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1FF05D,"February 10, 2017 05:49am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trading volumes at China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges have plummeted after the central bank put the virtual currency market under sharper scrutiny a month ago in a move that coincided with official efforts to stem capital outflows.  China had been the world’s leading venue for bitcoin trading, with analytics site Bitcoinity estimating that the  OkCoin, Huobi and BTCC exchanges had accounted for more than 90 percent of the global bitcoin market on Jan. 11.   But data compiled by analytics platform Sosobtc showed the number of bitcoins traded on the three exchanges slumped from 13.6 million on Jan. 6 to just over 120,000 on Feb. 9.   The People’s Bank of China launched checks into the three exchanges last month and they have responded by saying that they would improve their systems to prevent money laundering and the use of bitcoin to trade against the yuan.     On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China said it had also warned smaller bitcoin exchanges that it would shut them down if they violated regulations.   While the yuan CNY=CFXS weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP has soared to near-record highs.   That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency offers, has prompted some market operators to believe bitcoin had become an attractive, if niche, option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.  The three main exchanges have introduced trading fees, stopped allowing margin lending and increased scrutiny of user identities, making it far less attractive for automated, high speed trades which had previously accounted for the lion’s share of their business.  The absence of trading fees had provided an advantage over overseas rivals earlier, but that advantage has now gone, traders said.   Business has virtually dried up on Beijing-based high-speed bitcoin trading platform BotVS, according to chief executive Chen Zhenguo.  “With the transaction fees the profits you can get from hedging (Bitcoin) are too low...You might as well put your money in Yu’e Bao,” he said, referring to a money market fund run by an Alibaba Group (BABA.N) affiliate.   Other traders voiced similar sentiments.  Cai Wenhao, business manager at Sosobtc, said trading volume levels in China would likely normalize to around those seen on exchanges elsewhere, like the Hong Kong-based Bitifinex and U.S.-based Coinbase.

Cryptocompare, a data website that analyses bitcoin trading across dozens of exchanges globally, said around 50 percent of trading volume over the past 24 hours had been on the bitcoin/Japanese yen exchange rate.  “The Japanese have recently warmed their approach towards bitcoin by treating it legally as a form of payment - a ratification and bringing into the regulatory fold,” said Charles Hayter, the website’s founder.    “China’s clampdown on exchanges can also be seen as a positive move for the industry too,” he added.   Chinese authorities have increased scrutiny of exchanges this year and have forced them to start charging trading fees, after becoming concerned about bitcoin speculation and its potential use in money laundering.  Bitcoin surged as much as 3 percent on Tuesday on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, where trading is dollar-denominated, to hit $1,437 BTC=BTSP, its highest since its 2008 launch. That marked a more than 200 percent increase from its price in early May last year.   Its current levels put the total value of all bitcoins in circulation - the so-called “market cap” - close to $25 billion, putting its worth on a par with a large-cap company.

374,Nordic investor creates world's biggest Bitcoin database,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0K16O20140121,"January 21, 2014 01:58pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Nordic venture capital firm says it has built the world’s largest database of businesses dealing in Bitcoins in an effort to shed light on a virtual currency which has seen its value rocket in the past year.  Creandum said the database contained more than 300 companies trading Bitcoins - ranging from exchanges to payment processors and gambling companies - and was intended to give entrepreneurs and investors an overview of companies with a significant role in the Bitcoin system.  Bitcoin is essentially software code that defines units of value, which users can move back and forth among themselves. Unlike other virtual money transmitters, its value isn’t pegged to a hard currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro - it is determined by the demand for Bitcoins.  Since its launch in January 2009, the system has grown popular with people who lack confidence in the traditional banking system, though it has also aroused concerns it could be used for money laundering.  Creandum, which has invested in fast-growing Nordic tech firms such as online music streaming service Spotify and payment solutions firm iZettle, said it hoped to encourage Bitcoin enthusiasts to participate in the development of the currency.  “This year and next year the Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a payment mechanism, and it could go either way,” Creandum associate Joel Eriksson Enquist told Reuters.  ""Our hope is that the database will work like Wikipedia, with more and more contributors and more comprehensive data,"" he said of the open-source site which can be found at bitcoin.knackhq.com/btcdb .  Creandum has not invested in any Bitcoin-related companies but is looking at a couple of players and Enquist himself is holding onto 10 Bitcoins he bought last year for a little over $100 each - just for the fun of it.  The Bitcoin has recently traded above $1,000, up from $10 at the start of last year and fuelling concerns of a bubble.  Creandum said it may take another three years before it is clear whether Bitcoin is a bubble, or whether this is “the beginning of a new world”.  In December, the digital currency was dealt a blow when the People’s Bank of China banned financial institutions, though not individuals, from trading in Bitcoins.  U.S. prosecutors are also sitting on millions of dollars worth of the currency which had belonged to Silk Road, an online market that authorities say was a conduit for purchasing drugs and computer hacking services.  Creandum’s database lists 46 Bitcoin exchanges in North America, 24 in Europe and 21 in Asia. BTC China and Europe’s btc-e and Bitstamp are the biggest exchanges, with the three seeing 2.5 million Bitcoins traded on their platforms in the 30 days to January 9.

Likening bitcoin demand to the tulip bulb mania in 17th century Holland, Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said the mystique behind the cryptocurrency has caused its price to surge.  “If you don’t understand it, you get much more excited,” Buffett said on CNBC television. “People like to speculate, they like to gamble.”  He said investors now are much better off owning U.S. stocks, whose prices are elevated but not in a “bubble,” and it would take a “nanosecond” for him to choose stocks over 10- or 30-year U.S. government bonds now yielding around 3 percent.  Charlie Munger, Buffett’s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, is also no bitcoin fan, describing it as “worthless artificial gold.” He likened it to Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting, calling it “the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.”   Buffett, 87, and Munger, 94, spoke two days after they presided at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which was expected to have drawn more than 40,000 people.  It was the first meeting since Berkshire elevated longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen, making them top contenders to replace Buffett as chief executive.  Buffett said their promotions have been “very, very good” for the company. Berkshire has said its board knows who would become chief executive if the need arose.  One of its members, Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, said on CNBC “it’s not a horse race” between Abel and Jain.  Buffett renewed his desire to spend some of Berkshire’s low-yielding cash on a major acquisition. He said he would be happier if Berkshire had $30 billion of cash and equivalents, not the $108.6 billion it reported holding at the end of March.  “If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie and I really liked, we’d get it done,” he said.  Buffett revealed last week Berkshire had bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter, adding to the 165.3 million it already owns. It now has a 5 percent stake in the iPhone maker, trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.  Buffett said he would be happy to see the Apple share price fall if it would spur repurchases.  Munger, meanwhile, said Berkshire may have been “a little too restrained” in buying Apple, saying “it’s reasonably priced and strong.” He added: “I wished we owned more of it.”  Buffett also said the list of CEO candidates has been “narrowed down” for the healthcare venture between Berkshire, Amazon.com and JPMorgan Chase.

377,"Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1CH0YQ,"October 13, 2017 03:26pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.   Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.   Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.   Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.  But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.    “People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.    “The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.  On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.  But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.  Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news — whether negative or positive — drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.     Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of JP Morgan blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.   But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.    “Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.    CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY  By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.  Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.  “For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”   Other cryptocurrencies — whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin — also rallied. Their total value — or market capitalization — climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.   Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.   “Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.

378,U.S. states take lead in writing bitcoin rules,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0O30HF20140517,"May 17, 2014 04:03pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"CHICAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - A task force of U.S. state regulators is working on the first bitcoin rule-book, the head of the group said, hoping to protect users of virtual currency from fraud without smothering the fledgling technology.  Numerous companies in the United States enable customers to pay for goods and services in virtual currencies. But since bitcoins are not regulated by the federal government, users face a maze of rules in the 50 states.  “We may be looking at some type of model definitions, or model laws or regulations, and very likely recommendations to either our federal colleagues or to Congress,” David Cotney, Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, told Reuters on the sidelines of a public hearing into the issue on Friday.  Cotney was appointed in February to head the new Emerging Payments Task Force, a group of nine members of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). He said the task force had given itself roughly a year to complete the task.  The task force was hoping for a clearer definition of which operators needed to be regulated and which ones did not, Cotney said in the interview.  “Who’s in and who’s out? So if we can offer that (it) would be a ... big step,” he said. Cotney’s group also looks at other new payment technologies, such as mobile phone payments, and PayPal, an online money transfer service.  Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of so-called virtual currencies created by computers and governed by the Bitcoin Foundation, outside the control of any government. Some retailers accept bitcoins as payment on the Internet or in shops.  But recent mishaps have brought the technology under heightened scrutiny. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of client bitcoins.  State regulators say they will not stand in the way of virtual currency operators entering their states, but they want to ensure the business is safe.  Task force member Benjamin Lawksy, the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, in January said his department was working on a “BitLicense”. California is another state that has shown interest.  So far, federal regulators have been relatively mum. The Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) last year classified administrators or exchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters, which puts them under the remit of state regulators.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is studying whether it has jurisdiction, given that some firms are considering offering bitcoin derivatives. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has designated bitcoin as property, not currency.   (Reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by David Gregorio)",0.12786799999999998,0.06566666666666665

Sheng Songcheng, adviser to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), made the comments in an interview with financial magazine Yicai published late Thursday.  “Bitcoin does not have the fundamental attributes needed to be a currency as it is a string of code generated by complex algorithms...But I do not deny that virtual currencies have technical value and are a type of asset,” he said.  His comments come after the Chinese central bank increased scrutiny of the country’s bitcoin exchanges earlier this year, a move that prompted the companies to stop margin lending, introduced trading fees and issue rules to rein in users.  Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000. China has classified it as a “virtual good”.  Squaring in on bitcoin, Sheng said expectations that bitcoin supply would be capped in the year 2140 would make it difficult for it to become a medium of exchange that could meet modern economic development needs as money supply should be related to economic needs.  He also said that Chinese monetary authorities should study issuing a central bank virtual currency that it could regulate and run properly.

386,Nordic investor creates world's biggest Bitcoin database,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0K16O20140121,"January 21, 2014 01:58pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Nordic venture capital firm says it has built the world’s largest database of businesses dealing in Bitcoins in an effort to shed light on a virtual currency which has seen its value rocket in the past year.  Creandum said the database contained more than 300 companies trading Bitcoins - ranging from exchanges to payment processors and gambling companies - and was intended to give entrepreneurs and investors an overview of companies with a significant role in the Bitcoin system.  Bitcoin is essentially software code that defines units of value, which users can move back and forth among themselves. Unlike other virtual money transmitters, its value isn’t pegged to a hard currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro - it is determined by the demand for Bitcoins.  Since its launch in January 2009, the system has grown popular with people who lack confidence in the traditional banking system, though it has also aroused concerns it could be used for money laundering.  Creandum, which has invested in fast-growing Nordic tech firms such as online music streaming service Spotify and payment solutions firm iZettle, said it hoped to encourage Bitcoin enthusiasts to participate in the development of the currency.  “This year and next year the Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a payment mechanism, and it could go either way,” Creandum associate Joel Eriksson Enquist told Reuters.  ""Our hope is that the database will work like Wikipedia, with more and more contributors and more comprehensive data,"" he said of the open-source site which can be found at bitcoin.knackhq.com/btcdb .  Creandum has not invested in any Bitcoin-related companies but is looking at a couple of players and Enquist himself is holding onto 10 Bitcoins he bought last year for a little over $100 each - just for the fun of it.  The Bitcoin has recently traded above $1,000, up from $10 at the start of last year and fuelling concerns of a bubble.  Creandum said it may take another three years before it is clear whether Bitcoin is a bubble, or whether this is “the beginning of a new world”.  In December, the digital currency was dealt a blow when the People’s Bank of China banned financial institutions, though not individuals, from trading in Bitcoins.  U.S. prosecutors are also sitting on millions of dollars worth of the currency which had belonged to Silk Road, an online market that authorities say was a conduit for purchasing drugs and computer hacking services.  Creandum’s database lists 46 Bitcoin exchanges in North America, 24 in Europe and 21 in Asia. BTC China and Europe’s btc-e and Bitstamp are the biggest exchanges, with the three seeing 2.5 million Bitcoins traded on their platforms in the 30 days to January 9.  While there are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones appearing every week, Bitcoin is by far the best known.  E-commerce site Overstock.com recently announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency. Dating site OKCupid also allows Bitcoins as a form of payment.

387,Bitcoin's promise: a financial revolution the web's been waiting for,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2J27Y20140320,"March 20, 2014 05:05pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - Bitcoin may not be the messiah of a new currency its hardcore fans yearn for, but it may herald the deeper financial revolution the internet has been waiting for.  While computers and smartphones have brought the web to more than a third of the world’s population, online commerce still largely depends on a banking system that has changed little over recent decades, some of it relying on computer code written before the web was born.  The growing interest in bitcoin, a digital currency that requires no centralized body to handle transactions, is beginning to change all that.  “The rise of bitcoin has changed everyone’s idea of what a good payment system should be,” says Manu Sporny, CEO of web payments company Digital Bazaar, who is spearheading an effort to get the industry together to agree on standards for handling online transactions. “Bitcoin raised the bar, so everyone’s got to come in and match that in some way.”  A key moment, Sporny and others say, will be a meeting in Paris next week hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, one of the key bodies for setting internet standards.  Gathering for the first time to discuss web payment standards will be telecom operators such as Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica and AT&T, payment companies including SWIFT, PayPal and Gemalto, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin can claim some credit for this buzz of activity.  Much of the focus on bitcoin has been on its meteoric rise in value - soaring from $30 a year ago to above $1,000 late in the year - which has been only slightly dented by the collapse last month of Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange, with half a billion dollars’ worth of bitcoins missing.  But bitcoin as a currency might be a distraction.  Underpinning the digital currency is a combination of key computing principles - decentralized timestamping, public key cryptography and a proof of work system - that promise to revolutionize transactions.  Says Peter Vessenes, CEO of bitcoin start-up CoinLab and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting its adoption: “Those three could be turned into money, but they could also do a lot of other things.”  What interests some, and worries others, among those due to attend the Paris meeting is the promise bitcoin offers in cutting the cost of moving money around.  “If they can have it cheaper, they will make it cheaper,” said Marcus Swanepoel of Switchless, a Singapore-based company offering to integrate bitcoin processes into traditional banks and telecom companies.  Bitcoin poses a challenge for those used to handling consumer transactions: PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that credit card companies charge around 3 percent in transaction fees. PayPal’s cut can go as high as 4 percent. Those same transactions via bitcoin firms such as Coinbase and BitPay, which bypass central financial institutions, are as likely to be free.  However, Visa Inc’s head of innovation Jim McCarthy told an investors’ conference this month that while there were things to be learned about bitcoin, “I don’t see those as the things that are going to tip the apple cart anytime soon.”  MasterCard and Visa will not be at the Paris meeting, noted Sporny.  Indeed, there’s plenty of skepticism that bitcoin will amount to anything, with critics pointing to recent setbacks such as Mt. Gox and the libertarian bent of some of its supporters, as indicators it’s little more than a Ponzi scheme.  Some of bitcoin’s doubters come from within. Mike Hearn, a key contributor to the code underpinning bitcoin, dismisses talk of Ponzi schemes, but worries about complacency. “A lot of people seem to believe it’s a done deal, a dead cert. And I don’t see it that way at all.”  Hearn says that if bitcoin is going to challenge or win over the banking mainstream it needs to adopt better security while making it easier to use. And then, it needs to reach out to overcome the banking world’s anxiety about regulators and its perceived links to crime.  “The banking blockage, where all banks are afraid of touching bitcoin because they’re afraid of getting whacked by governments, is still the biggest challenge that bitcoin faces,” he said.  Switchless’ Swanepoel believes this fear is already dissipating. Standard Bank of South Africa, for example, recently ran a pilot using Switchless technology to integrate bitcoin trading into the bank’s own currency systems.  He sees similar interest among telephone operators and post offices looking for a cheap way to build a system to handle monetary transactions. But if bitcoin does make it into these behemoths, it’s likely to accompany existing technologies. “You don’t see bitcoin as something that would eliminate how things are done at the moment,” Swanepoel said in a phone interview. “They’re more likely to sit side by side.”  Start-up Ripple, for example, offers a way for users to buy and sell currencies using some bitcoin technologies but not its computer-hogging method of confirmation, called mining. End users needn’t know or care that they’re using a system with bitcoin roots.  “Then people won’t even know they’re using it, they’ll be using brands that they trust that will be using these protocols. All they’ll know is that they suddenly get to send money to India for free, instantly,” said Ripple CEO Chris Larsen.  Bitcoin’s biggest potential market may be among the millions of people with limited access to proper banking services.  Bitcoin naturally lends itself to the idea of a mobile wallet, and of small payments that have so far been too expensive for mass adoption. Users of dogecoin, a variant of bitcoin, for example, raised funds for the Jamaican bobsled team and three Indian athletes to go to last month’s Winter Olympics, and this week raised more than $30,000 to build wells in Kenya.  Bitcoin and its offshoots also offer a way round government currency controls - either by converting fiat currency to a virtual currency that can be sent overseas, or by bypassing the local currency entirely.  Next week, an Icelander who calls himself Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson will start releasing a new crypto-currency he has created himself, Auroracoin, to all Icelanders who want some. The idea, he said in an email interview, “is to free the Icelandic people from fiat currency and currency controls” by giving them access to a currency that can be traded online or, in theory, used to pay for goods and services.  Icelanders have been restricted from converting their cash into foreign currency since the 2008 financial crisis. Each Icelander can download their allocation of Auroracoins, worth about $500 at current prices, from a website.  “Hopefully this is the beginning of a lasting revolution, where the power over money is removed from the elite and placed in the hands of the people,” Baldur said.  Revolutionary talk aside, the legacy of bitcoin could be in the way it can decentralize any kind of transaction. The record of all transactions using the bitcoin protocol are stored in something called a blockchain - a log of where all bitcoins have changed hands.  Forget bitcoin as merely a currency, said the foundation’s Vessenes, and think of it as a decentralized way to confer and agree ownership.  The smallest unit of bitcoin, the satoshi, could be a token that represents ownership of a share - with details of who should be paid a dividend, or who can vote at shareholder meetings - all built directly into the token. Ownership of a car could be managed the same way, so it only responds to someone who can prove possession and ownership of that token.  “Money, or what one perceives as money, is just a form of disintermediated trust,” says Pindar Wong, a Hong Kong-based consultant who has been working on internet-based payment technologies. “There’s a whole scope of innovation here and we’re just touching the tip of a very big iceberg.”  Additional reporting by Sophie Knight in Tokyo; Editing by Ian Geoghegan",0.08754901960784316,0.05320250827603769
388,Australia to auction $11.5 mln confiscated bitcoins,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N18R019,"May 29, 2016 11:52pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Around A$16 million ($11.49 million) worth of confiscated bitcoins will be auctioned in Sydney next month, the first such auction outside the United States, as demand for the digital currency surged to its highest in nearly two years.  The sale will take place on June 20-21 and involve 24,518 coins, said auction organizer financial services group Ernst and Young on Monday.   U.S. Marshals auctioned off more than 170,000 bitcoins in 2014 and 2015, confiscated after the closure of Silk Road, a black market website.   Bitcoin has proved popular among users of underground market places and criminals because transactions are anonymous and need not involve any formal institution.   Ernst and Young said the bitcoin was “confiscated as proceeds of crime” but declined to identify its client. Local news reports have previously said that the bitcoin was confiscated from an Australian man convicted of commercial drug trafficking in 2014.   A spokesperson for the department of justice in Victoria state declined to comment, citing commercial considerations.    EY partner Adam Nikitins said the company expects interest from asset investment managers, currency exchanges, investment banks and hedge funds in North America and Europe.  “The number of bitcoin transactions since 2012 has quadrupled and parties are seeing more opportunities and uses for the technology,” said Nikitins.  The auction is not limited to Australian nationals. On Friday, the price of bitcoin rose to $530, the highest level since August 2014. Trades involving the Chinese yuan are estimated to account for as much as 95 percent of bitcoin’s trading volume. The market value of all bitcoin in circulation amounts to around $8 billion.($1 = 1.3930 Australian dollars)  ($1 = 1.3951 Australian dollars)  Reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff; additional reporting by Cecile Lefort in Sydney; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",0.24328999999999995,0.11714285714285717
389,Bitcoin's promise: a financial revolution the web's been waiting for,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0MH0AD20140320,"March 20, 2014 05:00pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"March 21 (Reuters) - Bitcoin may not be the messiah of a new currency its hardcore fans yearn for, but it may herald the deeper financial revolution the internet has been waiting for.  While computers and smartphones have brought the web to more than a third of the world’s population, online commerce still largely depends on a banking system that has changed little over recent decades, some of it relying on computer code written before the web was born.  The growing interest in bitcoin, a digital currency that requires no centralized body to handle transactions, is beginning to change all that.  “The rise of bitcoin has changed everyone’s idea of what a good payment system should be,” says Manu Sporny, CEO of web payments company Digital Bazaar, who is spearheading an effort to get the industry together to agree on standards for handling online transactions. “Bitcoin raised the bar, so everyone’s got to come in and match that in some way.”  A key moment, Sporny and others say, will be a meeting in Paris next week hosted by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, one of the key bodies for setting internet standards.  Gathering for the first time to discuss web payment standards will be telecom operators such as Deutsche Telekom , Telefonica and AT&T, payment companies including SWIFT, PayPal and Gemalto, as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin can claim some credit for this buzz of activity.  Much of the focus on bitcoin has been on its meteoric rise in value - soaring from $30 a year ago to above $1,000 late in the year - which has been only slightly dented by the collapse last month of Mt. Gox, a leading bitcoin exchange, with half a billion dollars’ worth of bitcoins missing.  But bitcoin as a currency might be a distraction.  Underpinning the digital currency is a combination of key computing principles - decentralized timestamping, public key cryptography and a proof of work system - that promise to revolutionise transactions.  Says Peter Vessenes, CEO of bitcoin start-up CoinLab and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting its adoption: “Those three could be turned into money, but they could also do a lot of other things.”  What interests some, and worries others, among those due to attend the Paris meeting is the promise bitcoin offers in cutting the cost of moving money around.  “If they can have it cheaper, they will make it cheaper,” said Marcus Swanepoel of Switchless, a Singapore-based company offering to integrate bitcoin processes into traditional banks and telecom companies.  Bitcoin poses a challenge for those used to handling consumer transactions: PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that credit card companies charge around 3 percent in transaction fees. PayPal’s cut can go as high as 4 percent. Those same transactions via bitcoin firms such as Coinbase and BitPay, which bypass central financial institutions, are as likely to be free.

390,Bitcoin slides on 'fraud' warning from JPMorgan's Dimon,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1BO232,"September 13, 2017 12:48pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid by more than 10 percent on Wednesday, as investors sold the cryptocurrency after a warning by JPMorgan (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon that it “is a fraud” and will eventually “blow up”.  Bitcoin, the original and still the biggest cryptocurrency, has been on a tear in recent months, hitting a record high just below $5,000 at the start of September after a more than fivefold increase in price since the start of the year.   But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been falling since early last week, when China banned the issuance of new digital coins for fundraising purposes - a phenomenon known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs.   ICOs have fueled a rapid ascent in the value of all cryptocurrencies, from about $17 billion at the start of the year - with bitcoin making up around 90 percent of that - to a record high close to $180 billion at the beginning of September, of which bitcoin represented less than half.   Following the ICO ban, the market was further spooked by reports early this week that Chinese authorities were planning to forbid any trading of cryptocurrencies and by a warning on ICOs from Britain’s financial watchdog, raising fears of a wider crackdown.  Dimon’s warning triggered a further 11 percent collapse in the price of bitcoin, which had already lost around 15 percent of its value in 10 days.   “He joins a long line of market commentators that have been critical of bitcoin and it potentially being in a bubble, so his comments could have been the tipping point,” said James Butterfill, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities in London.   The cryptocurrency tumbled to as low as $3,720.01 on the Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP before recovering to trade around $3,810 by 1524 GMT, still down 8.7 percent on the day.   Most other digital currencies were down also, with bitcoin’s main rival ether - often called Ethereum, the name given to the project behind the currency - down 10 percent on the day, according to Coinmarketcap, an industry website.   Dimon told an investor conference in New York that if any of his traders were found trading bitcoin he would “fire them in a second”, and that bitcoin was “worse than tulips bulbs,” referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s.  “This is not the first time that Jamie Dimon has spoken against the currency - the last time he had a similar go on the currency was in November 2015,” said ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam. “Since then, the currency has had a remarkable run.”   “Most importantly, given that the CEO does not think that shorting this trade would yield a more favorable outcome shows that the cryptocurrency has a lot more room to run.”  (This version of the story was refiled to fix garbled third paragraph)  Reporting by Jemima Kelly, editing by Larry King",-0.07989166666666665,0.10041441197691199
391,RPT-Bitcoin flounders in Australia as regulatory worries bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N12403420151004,"October 04, 2015 05:00pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Repeats story that ran Sunday with no changes to text)  * Australian banks closed accounts of 13 bitcoin exchanges  * Businesses wary of currency’s potential crime links  * Australia estimated to hold 7 percent of bitcoin’s global value  By Byron Kaye and Swati Pandey  SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Australian businesses are turning their backs on bitcoin, as signs grow that the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal is fading.  Concerns about bitcoin’s potential crime links mean many businesses have stopped accepting it, a trend accelerated by Australian banks’ move last month to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.  The development is a blow to hopes of bitcoin fans that the currency can play a significant role in everyday business transactions in developed economies, with Australia once seen as one of its most promising markets. It is estimated to hold 7 percent of the currency’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.  “We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which ditched the currency in late 2014 after the firm was investigated by the federal tax office.  Forsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees via bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe found no wrongdoing but Forsyth was burned by the negative publicity and bailed out before ever taking a bitcoin payment.  Although most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. already refuse to keep bitcoin-affiliated accounts, developments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system.  The move makes it much harder for people to convert regular currencies in to or out of bitcoin, threatening its long-term value.  “It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer Adrian Lee.  The banks’ shutdown appears at odds with a government inquiry which in August recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin. The Australian anti-money laundering agency, AUSTRAC, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.  The so-called “Big Four” banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank  - directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.  Tony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, wouldn’t confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said in an email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base”.  Australia’s organised crime agency has said it is concerned the currency’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and selling illicit drugs.  In the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but lack of industry co-ordination has left room for individual lenders to support the currency, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and tech-focused Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank.  The 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.  The remaining four have had their accounts frozen, and now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into several smaller bank accounts to avoid detection by their banks.  Buyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining four exchanges, said it is still considering its options.  “It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange.  Smith declined to identify which bank his firm is now using from fear of repercussions but said he plans to move the business offshore.  Two sources told Reuters that regional lender Bank of Queensland still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite” but did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.  Some industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.  At least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, told Reuters they were considering exiting the currency.  “If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of off-road vehicle maker Tomcar Australia, which has sold one car using bitcoin since introducing it in November 2014.  Grant Fairweather, owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when a group of digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.  “They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather, who sells about A$100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.  An online clothing retailer told Reuters she had made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013 and asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it”.

China had been the world’s leading venue for bitcoin trading, with analytics site Bitcoinity estimating that the  OkCoin, Huobi and BTCC exchanges had accounted for more than 90 percent of the global bitcoin market on Jan. 11.   But data compiled by analytics platform Sosobtc showed the number of bitcoins traded on the three exchanges slumped from 13.6 million on Jan. 6 to just over 120,000 on Feb. 9.   The People’s Bank of China launched checks into the three exchanges last month and they have responded by saying that they would improve their systems to prevent money laundering and the use of bitcoin to trade against the yuan.     On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China said it had also warned smaller bitcoin exchanges that it would shut them down if they violated regulations.   While the yuan CNY=CFXS weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP has soared to near-record highs.   That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency offers, has prompted some market operators to believe bitcoin had become an attractive, if niche, option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.  The three main exchanges have introduced trading fees, stopped allowing margin lending and increased scrutiny of user identities, making it far less attractive for automated, high speed trades which had previously accounted for the lion’s share of their business.  The absence of trading fees had provided an advantage over overseas rivals earlier, but that advantage has now gone, traders said.   Business has virtually dried up on Beijing-based high-speed bitcoin trading platform BotVS, according to chief executive Chen Zhenguo.  “With the transaction fees the profits you can get from hedging (Bitcoin) are too low...You might as well put your money in Yu’e Bao,” he said, referring to a money market fund run by an Alibaba Group (BABA.N) affiliate.   Other traders voiced similar sentiments.  Cai Wenhao, business manager at Sosobtc, said trading volume levels in China would likely normalize to around those seen on exchanges elsewhere, like the Hong Kong-based Bitifinex and U.S.-based Coinbase.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who famously accused Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, said they used bitcoins to buy tickets for a high-altitude voyage on billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic commercial spaceflight venture.  The brothers, Olympic rowers who earned MBA degrees from Oxford University, have become bitcoin evangelists and investors and are planning to launch a fund to make it easy to trade the digital currency on the stock market.  In a blog post, Tyler Winklevoss compared Branson’s space endeavor and bitcoin entrepreneurs to major historical figures who changed the way the world was perceived, like Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Nicolaus Copernicus.  “It is in this vein that Cameron and I contemplate our tickets into space - as seed capital supporting a new technology that may forever change the way we travel, purchased with a new technology that may forever change the way we transact,” he wrote.  Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of Branson’s London-based Virgin Group, is selling rides on its SpaceShipTwo for $250,000.  The twins are not the first to sign up for Virgin Galactic using bitcoins, but it is the highest-profile flight booking to date using the currency. Last November, Branson announced that a flight attendant from Hawaii had become the first person to pay for a seat with bitcoins.  Bitcoin, a digital currency that is traded on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control, has seen its value soar in the past year as it gains attention from growing numbers of investors, entrepreneurs and regulators.  But the virtual currency’s struggle for legitimacy has been shaken by recent debacles, including the collapse last week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s dominant bitcoin exchange.  Few major retailers have begun accepting payment in bitcoins, and critics say the currency’s high volatility makes it unsuitable for everyday transactions.  The six-passenger, two-pilot SpaceShipTwo is hauled into the air by a twin-hull carrier jet and then released.  The upcoming flights are designed to reach altitudes of more than 65 miles (100 km) above Earth, high enough to see the curvature of the planet set against the blackness of space.",0.031786666666666664,0.07535227272727271

Cryptocompare, a data website that analyses bitcoin trading across dozens of exchanges globally, said around 50 percent of trading volume over the past 24 hours had been on the bitcoin/Japanese yen exchange rate.  “The Japanese have recently warmed their approach towards bitcoin by treating it legally as a form of payment - a ratification and bringing into the regulatory fold,” said Charles Hayter, the website’s founder.    “China’s clampdown on exchanges can also be seen as a positive move for the industry too,” he added.   Chinese authorities have increased scrutiny of exchanges this year and have forced them to start charging trading fees, after becoming concerned about bitcoin speculation and its potential use in money laundering.  Bitcoin surged as much as 3 percent on Tuesday on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, where trading is dollar-denominated, to hit $1,437 BTC=BTSP, its highest since its 2008 launch. That marked a more than 200 percent increase from its price in early May last year.   Its current levels put the total value of all bitcoins in circulation - the so-called “market cap” - close to $25 billion, putting its worth on a par with a large-cap company.  Bitcoin analysts said the price had also been boosted by a request by the BATS exchange that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission review its March decision not to approve a bitcoin-tracking ETF set up by the Winklevoss brothers.

397,Bitcoin bank Flexcoin shuts down after theft,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2329B20140304,"March 04, 2014 06:13pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - Bitcoin bank Flexcoin said on Tuesday it was closing down after it lost bitcoins worth about $600,000 to a hacker attack.  Flexcoin said in a message posted on its website that all 896 bitcoins stored online were stolen on Sunday.  ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately,"" the company said. (r.reuters.com/web47v)  Alberta, Canada-based Flexcoin, which is working with law enforcement agencies to trace the source of the hack, said it would return bitcoins stored offline, or in “cold storage”, to users.  Cold storage coins are held in computers not connected to the Internet and therefore cannot be hacked.  Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, saying it may have lost some 850,000 bitcoins due to hacking into its faulty computer system.  Flexcoin said on February 25 it was not affected by Mt. Gox’s closure. “While the Mt. Gox closure is unfortunate, we at Flexcoin have not lost anything,” it had tweeted.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional money, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion.  According to Tuesday’s price on Bitstamp, one of the largest exchanges for trading bitcoins, the crypto-currency was valued at about $668.57.

Thursday's drop to as low as $9,022 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP left bitcoin trading at less than half the peak price of almost $20,000 it reached in December. It slid more than 26 percent last month, in its worst monthly performance since January 2015.  Other cryptocurrencies, including Ripple, the third-largest by market value, and Bitcoin Cash, have also racked up double-digit declines in the last 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com, which tracks the industry. Ethereum was up slightly on the day.  Last year’s explosive rise in the value of digital coins and the flood of new retail investors drawn to the market have rattled global regulators nervous about a sector used largely for speculation.  Officials have said cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to launder money. India, which has likened the market to a Ponzi scheme, on Thursday vowed to eliminate their use..  The Indian finance minister said his government would take “all measures” to remove crypto-assets in “financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system”, Arun Jaitley told parliament.  “Sentiment towards cryptocurrencies is turning sour with negative headlines pouring out from left, right and center,” said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at FOREX.com   “Concerns that Facebook is banning ads and major crypto exchanges shutting down have really silenced the hype and some people are probably having second thoughts about investing their hard-earned cash into digital currencies.”   Facebook (FB.O) said in a post on its website this week that it was banning all advertising that “promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency”.  It was not clear whether the ban would affect all cryptocurrency adverts on the social media site. Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.   A $530 million hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck late last week has also weighed on the market, along with a subpoena U.S. regulators sent to two of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency players, Bitfinex and Tether.   In a development welcomed by cryptocurrency investors, the finance minister of South Korea, a major hub for digital coin trading, said on Wednesday there was no plan to outlaw their buying and selling after regulators had earlier pledged to do so.  Critics call cryptocurrencies a speculative mania that will end in tears for thousands of retail investors. Supporters say the price volatility is a distraction from the value of the underlying technology.  Those backers believe cryptocurrencies and the “blockchain” technology underpinning them will transform the way money is stored and transferred, upending the conventional banking system.   “Short-term pessimism misses the point that it [regulation] could make the ecosystem thrive in the long term,” said Charles Hayter, founder of London-based Cryptocompare.  International regulators are set to debate how to address the risks posed by the market at the next G20 meeting in March.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney said this week that the G20 needed to consider how easily digital coins should be converted into other central-bank issued currencies, as well as the role of anonymity, as “a lot of the underlying use of these currencies has been illicit activity”.   Bitcoin rallied more than 1,000 percent last year as speculators piled in. The price was less than $500 as recently as early 2016.

399,"Bitcoin rockets above $5,000 to all-time high",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1CH0YQ,"October 13, 2017 03:26pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.   Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.   Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.   Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.  But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.    “People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.    “The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.  On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.  But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.  Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news — whether negative or positive — drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.     Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of JP Morgan blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.   But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.    “Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.    CRYPTO-RIVALS ALSO RALLY  By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.  Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.  “For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”   Other cryptocurrencies — whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin — also rallied. Their total value — or market capitalization — climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.   Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.   “Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price.

400,"Bitstamp to resume withdrawals, steadying nervous bitcoin market",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1D1NJ20140214,"February 14, 2014 04:19pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the bitcoin exchanges that recently suspended withdrawals of the digital currency on Friday said it planned to allow redemptions to resume later in the day, restoring some confidence to the shaken market.  Slovenia-based Bitstamp, among the largest bitcoin exchanges, said on its website that developers had come up with a solution to thwart the cyber attacks against its platform that had forced the hiatus. It suspended withdrawals on Tuesday, days after one of the best known exchanges, Mt. Gox, suspended withdrawals indefinitely.  “After additional testing, we plan to enable bitcoin withdrawals later today,” Bitstamp’s statement said.  Mt. Gox has not yet resumed withdrawals and has not issued a public update on the matter since Monday.  Bitcoin prices continued their pattern of volatile trading on Friday, and prices varied widely by exchange. On Mt. Gox, where trading has continued despite the withdrawal suspension, the price plunged to as low as $302 early on Friday, but recovered later in the day following the Bitstamp announcement, last trading at $443, down about 7.5 percent from Thursday.  “The news that Bitstamp is resuming withdrawals restored some confidence and prompted people to buy back bitcoin,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldWideMarkets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. “The fear trade seems to have dissipated.”  At CoinDesk, which this week excluded Mt. Gox data from its Bitcoin Price Index, the currency’s price was substantially higher. There, bitcoin was quoted at $647.12, up more than 8 percent on the day.  Adding to the choppiness were reports that the online drugs marketplace Silk Road 2 had been hacked and drained of about $2.7 million worth of the digital currency. CNN said the site’s administrator posted the news late on Thursday.  The first Silk Road site, which like its successor was accessible only using a special program that hides users’ physical locations, was shut down last year by U.S. law enforcement authorities, and the man authorities say was behind its operations was arrested and charged with narcotics trafficking and money laundering.  “There should be no impact on bitcoin prices based on the reduction of illegal activity,” said Sebastien Galy, currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York. “It really indicates that there’s nervousness in the market.”  Galy said seasoned traders likely bought bitcoin after its price dropped.  “Professional traders would recognize that there is overselling based on irrational fears,” he said.

401,RPT-Bitcoin flounders in Australia as regulatory worries bite,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N12403420151004,"October 04, 2015 05:00pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Repeats story that ran Sunday with no changes to text)  * Australian banks closed accounts of 13 bitcoin exchanges  * Businesses wary of currency’s potential crime links  * Australia estimated to hold 7 percent of bitcoin’s global value  By Byron Kaye and Swati Pandey  SYDNEY, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Australian businesses are turning their backs on bitcoin, as signs grow that the cryptocurrency’s mainstream appeal is fading.  Concerns about bitcoin’s potential crime links mean many businesses have stopped accepting it, a trend accelerated by Australian banks’ move last month to close the accounts of 13 of the country’s 17 bitcoin exchanges.  The development is a blow to hopes of bitcoin fans that the currency can play a significant role in everyday business transactions in developed economies, with Australia once seen as one of its most promising markets. It is estimated to hold 7 percent of the currency’s $3.5 billion global value, a sizeable figure in a country of just 24 million people.  “We’ve got a squeaky clean reputation, and that’s actually worth a lot more to us than dipping into this,” said James Snodgrass, principal of Sydney’s Forsyth Real Estate, which ditched the currency in late 2014 after the firm was investigated by the federal tax office.  Forsyth had offered to collect home deposits and other realtor fees via bitcoin to cater to international buyers. The tax office probe found no wrongdoing but Forsyth was burned by the negative publicity and bailed out before ever taking a bitcoin payment.  Although most mainstream banks in Europe and the U.S. already refuse to keep bitcoin-affiliated accounts, developments in Australia represent the first coordinated shutdown of bitcoin exchanges by a country’s banking system.  The move makes it much harder for people to convert regular currencies in to or out of bitcoin, threatening its long-term value.  “It really runs on people using bitcoin, and if nobody uses it then it’s worthless,” said University of Technology Sydney senior finance lecturer Adrian Lee.  The banks’ shutdown appears at odds with a government inquiry which in August recommended removing sales tax for people who buy bitcoin. The Australian anti-money laundering agency, AUSTRAC, told Reuters that banks have no legal obligation to close bitcoin accounts.  The so-called “Big Four” banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank  - directed inquiries about bitcoin to the Australian Bankers’ Association.  Tony Pearson, the association’s acting chief executive, wouldn’t confirm the coordinated rejection of bitcoin but said in an email that its “lack of transparency and regulatory oversight raises a number of risks for users and also poses risks for the payments system, the integrity of the financial system and the erosion of the tax base”.  Australia’s organised crime agency has said it is concerned the currency’s untraceable nature makes it attractive for money laundering and selling illicit drugs.  In the U.K. and the U.S., most large banks have already cut ties with bitcoin account holders, but lack of industry co-ordination has left room for individual lenders to support the currency, including Germany’s Fidor Bank AG, which operates in Britain, and tech-focused Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank.  The 13 Australian bitcoin exchanges whose accounts were closed by the banks have shut operations.  The remaining four have had their accounts frozen, and now face three options: close, move overseas or spread their business into several smaller bank accounts to avoid detection by their banks.  Buyabitcoin.com.au, one of the remaining four exchanges, said it is still considering its options.  “It makes it, obviously, hard to take payments from our customers, but we have a couple of relationships left,” said Andrew Smith, general manager of the Melbourne-based exchange.  Smith declined to identify which bank his firm is now using from fear of repercussions but said he plans to move the business offshore.  Two sources told Reuters that regional lender Bank of Queensland still held some bitcoin accounts. The bank said in an email that “virtual currencies fall outside of our risk appetite” but did not deny or confirm it had these accounts.  Some industry watchers believe ambivalence may be bitcoin’s biggest problem.  At least six Australian retail businesses, which as recently as 2014 courted publicity for offering sales by bitcoin, told Reuters they were considering exiting the currency.  “If governments begin to aggressively attack the whole idea of cryptocurrencies and give it a bad name, it might have an adverse effect on our brand by accepting it,” said David Brim, co-founder of off-road vehicle maker Tomcar Australia, which has sold one car using bitcoin since introducing it in November 2014.  Grant Fairweather, owner of the Metropolitan Hotel in Sydney, said he started accepting bitcoin when a group of digital currency fans chose his pub as their regular meeting venue.  “They tell me that it’s doing quite well, but that doesn’t transpose into here,” said Fairweather, who sells about A$100 ($70) worth of drinks via bitcoin from the meetings and does no other bitcoin trade.  An online clothing retailer told Reuters she had made no bitcoin sales since introducing the service in 2013 and asked not to be named, saying “since bitcoin’s going out anyway, we’d rather not throw our name back into it”.

402,FEATURE-Bitcoin catches on in tech-savvy Romania,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0PT4CA20140728,"July 28, 2014 06:45am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BUCHAREST, July 28 (Reuters) - In a well-lit office with red window frames in downtown Bucharest, Romania’s first bitcoin ATM attracts many who until it opened in May had to buy or sell the digital currency face-to-face or through wire transfers.  The interest in bitcoin in Romania stands out in a region where national currencies are widely seen as poor substitutes for the euro.  Tech-savvy and still deeply distrustful of officialdom 25 years after the end of communism, many Romanians are unfazed by warnings about the cryptocurrency.  In the western town of Oradea, 370 miles (595 km) away from the capital, the first bitcoin exchange in the country has drawn more than 2,000 clients in the seven months since it opened, with transactions totalling 5.12 million lei ($1.57 million).  But Romania ranks as the European Union’s second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin.  Bitcoin is still an infant in Europe relative to the United States, where hundreds of start-ups backed by some Wall Street traders and venture capitalists have propelled consumer and media interest. Activity in virtual currencies around Europe is concentrated in London, Amsterdam and Berlin.  Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility.  “It is an industry in its early stages,” said George Rotariu, who opened the ATM in Bucharest in collaboration with Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and plans to expand to more Romanian cities. “You need a legislative framework to supply services or have a business in this field,” he said.  “We groped around in the legislation and interpreted some policies,” said Horea Vuscan, a local politician who owns the Oradea bitcoin operator BTCXchange.  “We are now in talks with officials because I don’t know where we fit in, a bourse, bank, money transfer firm.”  Bitcoin is stored entirely on computers, not backed by any government or central bank. It lets owners hold, trade and move money from place to place almost as cheaply as sending email.  Its use has raised concerns for governments around the world, especially after Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world’s leading bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after saying some 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing.  A report by Bank of America last year found bitcoin showed promise as a low-cost way to do e-commerce and as an alternative to traditional money transfer services, but could also be used to evade high taxes, capital controls and confiscation.  In July, the European Banking Authority, the EU’s banking watchdog, urged national policymakers to discourage credit and payment institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies pending a regulatory framework.  “Using bitcoin in Romania is not regulated and carries very large risks,” said the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority (ASF). “The risk of fraud is also not to be ruled out.”  It said the industry “would need to have a visible economic significance in Romania, which it does not”, before regulation is considered, adding it would enforce any EU-approved rules.  Some EU states, including Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany or Poland have found ways to tax bitcoin transactions.  But Romania collects just under 60 percent of its regular tax goal. That amounts to roughly 33 percent of economic output, well below the bloc’s 46 percent average.  “There is some preoccupation with bitcoin,” one finance ministry official said. “But a legal framework is some time away and only after that will we analyse the need for a fiscal one.”  The number of Romanian service providers accepting bitcoins - which are divisible to eight decimal places - has risen slowly to a handful of coffeeshops, gyms, restaurants and beauty salons, according to service tracker coinmap.org.  “I want to bring bitcoin to street level, I want everyone to have a phone app where they keep their coins and use it everywhere, in coffee shops, restaurants, grocery shops, just like a regular wallet,” BTCXchange owner Vuscan said.  But before it can gain greater traction, bitcoin needs to address its volatility; it has swung from 1,170 lei ($370) to 3,406 lei ($1,100) this year, according to Oradea’s BTCXchange.  Vuscan’s exchange works only for Romanian leu deals, but he plans to open it to euro and dollar transactions, hoping to join larger European bitcoin exchanges such as Slovenia’s Bitstamp.  BTCXchange is registered as a standard company. Vuscan enforced some safeguards - users are required to have a bank account and there are self-imposed policies against money laundering. But there are no legal or regulatory safeguards.  Bitcoin’s rise in Romania is partially due to its status as one of Europe’s active technology hubs. The country has attracted investors including Oracle, IBM and Intel.  But while Romania boasts pockets of super-fast internet networks, only 58 percent of households have internet access, below the EU average. A 2012 Verizon report also said Romania was the world’s second-biggest hacking centre after China.  Vuscan says his exchange is safe and he will reimburse clients if their bitcoins get stolen. “I can hardly wait for them to try,” he said when asked about hacker attacks.

403,Chinese bitcoin exchanges say to strengthen scrutiny of customers,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15O1CR,"February 09, 2017 12:27pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Two of China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges said they were taking measures to stop withdrawals of the cryptocurrency from their platforms, as capital outflows prompt the Chinese central bank to step up its scrutiny of the industry.   OkCoin and Huobi said in statements published on their websites late on Thursday that they would halt withdrawals of bitcoins completely, while the other big exchange BTCC said it would subject withdrawals to a 72-hour review.   Earlier in the day, the exchanges had issued statements saying they would strengthen oversight of customers’ identities and sources of funds. They had also said they would upgrade their anti-money laundering systems, but that withdrawals of Chinese yuan would not be affected.   These measures come after China’s central bank said it called nine of the country’s smaller bitcoin exchanges in to a Wednesday meeting to discuss risks in the bitcoin market, and warned them they risked closure if they seriously violated regulations or took part in activities such as margin lending.   Bitcoin prices on European exchange Bitstamp were down 0.8 percent on Friday, trading at $975.61.  Beijing signaled it was keeping a closer eye on the bitcoin industry last month by launching checks into BTCC, Huobi and OkCoin, amid growing government efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on China’s currency, the yuan.   While the yuan weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price has soared to near-record highs.]  That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency offers, has prompted some to believe bitcoin has become an attractive option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.  BTCC, Huobi and OkCoin last month stopped margin lending and introduced trading fees after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) launched checks into them.  In their Thursday statements, they also said they may freeze assets or limit trading by users who were found to flout rules. The statements contained links to documents published by China’s banking regulator warning investors about market risks.   News of meetings between the various exchanges and the PBOC, and other government agencies has caused the bitcoin price to swing wildly.  On Wednesday, the price fell from a one-month high after sources at bitcoin exchanges in China said the PBOC had summoned some exchanges to a closed-door meeting, before recovering all of those losses in U.S. and European time.  The PBOC said the nine exchanges involved in the Wednesday meeting were CHBTC, BtcTrade, HaoBTC, Yunbi, Yuanbao, BTC100, Jubi, BitBays and Dahonghuo. Industry insiders said the majority of these exchanges allowed other cryptocurrencies to be traded on their platforms besides bitcoin.   BtcTrade, Bitbays and BTC100 declined to comment on the meeting. Reuters was unable to immediately reach the other six platforms for comment.  The Chinese actions will ultimately be good for the industry, said Charles Hayter, Chief Executive Officer of London-based digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare.  “The PBOC moves to regulate Bitcoin more stringently will bring short-term woes but will ultimately strengthen the ecosystem,” he said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  According to Hayter, trading between the Chinese yuan and bitcoin has fallen to around 26 percent of the bitcoin-fiat currency market from 98 percent at the start of the year.

404,"Bitcoins are property, not currency, IRS says regarding taxes",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2O1LR20140325,"March 25, 2014 07:03pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wading into a murky tax question for the digital age, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service said on Tuesday that bitcoins and other virtual currencies are to be treated, for tax purposes, as property and not as currency.  “General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency,” the IRS said in a statement, meaning that bitcoins would be taxed as ordinary income or as assets subject to capital gains taxes, depending on the circumstance.  Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, started circulating in 2009. Its present market value is around $8 billion, with up to 80,000 transactions occurring daily, according to accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Recent incidents have brought the currency under new regulatory scrutiny, such as the failure of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.  Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control or backing by any government or central bank, which its proponents like, but which also has led to calls for more guidance on U.S. tax treatment.  The IRS supplied that in its statement, which dealt a blow to bitcoin “miners,” who unlock new bitcoins online. The IRS said miners must include the fair market value of the virtual currency as gross income on the date of receipt.  This change “is a disincentive to start looking for bitcoins,” said John Barrie, a partner with law firm Bryan Cave LLP, who advises charities that receive bitcoins as donations.  The IRS also said that virtual currency is not to be treated as legal-tender currency to determine if a transaction causes a foreign currency gain or loss under U.S. tax law.  For other forms of gains or losses involving virtual currency, the IRS explained how to determine the U.S. dollar value of virtual currency and said taxable gains or losses can be incurred in related property transactions.  “The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer,” the IRS said.  If a taxpayer holds virtual currency as capital - like stocks or bonds or other investment property - gains or losses are realized as capital gains or losses, the agency said.  However, when virtual currency is held as inventory or other property mainly for sale to customers in a trade or business, ordinary gains or losses are generally incurred, the IRS said.  Capital gains and losses are taxable and deductible at different rates and amounts than ordinary gains and losses.  Democratic Senator Tom Carper, who chaired a Senate committee hearing last year on bitcoin, said in a statement that the IRS guidance “provides clarity for taxpayers who want to ensure that they’re doing the right thing and playing by the rules when utilizing bitcoin and other digital currencies.”  New bitcoins come from a process called mining. Computer programmers around the world compete to crack an automatically generated code and the first to do so is rewarded with a small stash. This happens about every 10 minutes.  Some online retailers will accept bitcoins as payment. The maximum potential number of bitcoins in circulation is 21 million, compared with around 12 million currently.  On the IRS guidance, William Lewis, a lawyer in Sunnyvale, California, who represents a start-up company creating a platform for virtual currencies, said: “This is going to be unfavorable to bitcoin miners because they’re going to have to include in income the fair market value of the virtual currency on the date they mined it.  “It’s going to make life difficult for a lot of people who have been mining over the past year, who have to go back and see what the values were on those dates when they mined it.”  Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Steve Orlofsky",0.1670333333333333,0.012926553898776118
405,FEATURE-Bitcoin catches on in tech-savvy Romania,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0PT4CA20140728,"July 28, 2014 06:45am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BUCHAREST, July 28 (Reuters) - In a well-lit office with red window frames in downtown Bucharest, Romania’s first bitcoin ATM attracts many who until it opened in May had to buy or sell the digital currency face-to-face or through wire transfers.  The interest in bitcoin in Romania stands out in a region where national currencies are widely seen as poor substitutes for the euro.  Tech-savvy and still deeply distrustful of officialdom 25 years after the end of communism, many Romanians are unfazed by warnings about the cryptocurrency.  In the western town of Oradea, 370 miles (595 km) away from the capital, the first bitcoin exchange in the country has drawn more than 2,000 clients in the seven months since it opened, with transactions totalling 5.12 million lei ($1.57 million).  But Romania ranks as the European Union’s second-poorest state and among the weakest in collecting taxes and fighting fraud, making it poorly equipped to manage the bitcoin.  Bitcoin is still an infant in Europe relative to the United States, where hundreds of start-ups backed by some Wall Street traders and venture capitalists have propelled consumer and media interest. Activity in virtual currencies around Europe is concentrated in London, Amsterdam and Berlin.  Romanian entrepreneurs envision a future where the bitcoin is as common as grocery shopping. But they say it needs a legal framework to gain credibility.  “It is an industry in its early stages,” said George Rotariu, who opened the ATM in Bucharest in collaboration with Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and plans to expand to more Romanian cities. “You need a legislative framework to supply services or have a business in this field,” he said.  “We groped around in the legislation and interpreted some policies,” said Horea Vuscan, a local politician who owns the Oradea bitcoin operator BTCXchange.  “We are now in talks with officials because I don’t know where we fit in, a bourse, bank, money transfer firm.”  Bitcoin is stored entirely on computers, not backed by any government or central bank. It lets owners hold, trade and move money from place to place almost as cheaply as sending email.  Its use has raised concerns for governments around the world, especially after Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world’s leading bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after saying some 850,000 bitcoins had gone missing.  A report by Bank of America last year found bitcoin showed promise as a low-cost way to do e-commerce and as an alternative to traditional money transfer services, but could also be used to evade high taxes, capital controls and confiscation.  In July, the European Banking Authority, the EU’s banking watchdog, urged national policymakers to discourage credit and payment institutions from buying, holding, or selling virtual currencies pending a regulatory framework.  “Using bitcoin in Romania is not regulated and carries very large risks,” said the Romanian Financial Supervision Authority (ASF). “The risk of fraud is also not to be ruled out.”  It said the industry “would need to have a visible economic significance in Romania, which it does not”, before regulation is considered, adding it would enforce any EU-approved rules.  Some EU states, including Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany or Poland have found ways to tax bitcoin transactions.  But Romania collects just under 60 percent of its regular tax goal. That amounts to roughly 33 percent of economic output, well below the bloc’s 46 percent average.  “There is some preoccupation with bitcoin,” one finance ministry official said. “But a legal framework is some time away and only after that will we analyse the need for a fiscal one.”  The number of Romanian service providers accepting bitcoins - which are divisible to eight decimal places - has risen slowly to a handful of coffeeshops, gyms, restaurants and beauty salons, according to service tracker coinmap.org.  “I want to bring bitcoin to street level, I want everyone to have a phone app where they keep their coins and use it everywhere, in coffee shops, restaurants, grocery shops, just like a regular wallet,” BTCXchange owner Vuscan said.  But before it can gain greater traction, bitcoin needs to address its volatility; it has swung from 1,170 lei ($370) to 3,406 lei ($1,100) this year, according to Oradea’s BTCXchange.  Vuscan’s exchange works only for Romanian leu deals, but he plans to open it to euro and dollar transactions, hoping to join larger European bitcoin exchanges such as Slovenia’s Bitstamp.  BTCXchange is registered as a standard company. Vuscan enforced some safeguards - users are required to have a bank account and there are self-imposed policies against money laundering. But there are no legal or regulatory safeguards.  Bitcoin’s rise in Romania is partially due to its status as one of Europe’s active technology hubs. The country has attracted investors including Oracle, IBM and Intel.  But while Romania boasts pockets of super-fast internet networks, only 58 percent of households have internet access, below the EU average. A 2012 Verizon report also said Romania was the world’s second-biggest hacking centre after China.  Vuscan says his exchange is safe and he will reimburse clients if their bitcoins get stolen. “I can hardly wait for them to try,” he said when asked about hacker attacks.

406,Bitcoin trading shrivels under Chinese government's glare,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15P15U,"February 10, 2017 05:58am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trading volumes at China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges have plummeted after the central bank put the virtual currency market under sharper scrutiny a month ago in a move that coincided with official efforts to stem capital outflows.  China had been the world’s leading venue for bitcoin trading, with analytics site Bitcoinity estimating that the  OkCoin, Huobi and BTCC exchanges had accounted for more than 90 percent of the global bitcoin market on Jan. 11.   But data compiled by analytics platform Sosobtc showed the number of bitcoins traded on the three exchanges slumped from 13.6 million on Jan. 6 to just over 120,000 on Feb. 9.   The People’s Bank of China launched checks into the three exchanges last month and they have responded by saying that they would improve their systems to prevent money laundering and the use of bitcoin to trade against the yuan.     On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China said it had also warned smaller bitcoin exchanges that it would shut them down if they violated regulations.   While the yuan CNY=CFXS weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP has soared to near-record highs.   That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency offers, has prompted some market operators to believe bitcoin had become an attractive, if niche, option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.  The three main exchanges have introduced trading fees, stopped allowing margin lending and increased scrutiny of user identities, making it far less attractive for automated, high speed trades which had previously accounted for the lion’s share of their business.  The absence of trading fees had provided an advantage over overseas rivals earlier, but that advantage has now gone, traders said.   Business has virtually dried up on Beijing-based high-speed bitcoin trading platform BotVS, according to chief executive Chen Zhenguo.  “With the transaction fees the profits you can get from hedging (Bitcoin) are too low...You might as well put your money in Yu’e Bao,” he said, referring to a money market fund run by an Alibaba Group (BABA.N) affiliate.   Other traders voiced similar sentiments.  Cai Wenhao, business manager at Sosobtc, said trading volume levels in China would likely normalize to around those seen on exchanges elsewhere, like the Hong Kong-based Bitifinex and U.S.-based Coinbase.

407,U.S. watchdog calls bitcoin 'Wild West' of finance,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0GB1KF20140811,"August 11, 2014 02:12pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virtual currencies such as bitcoin are the “Wild West” of financial products because of risks including huge swings in exchange rates, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Monday.  “Virtual currencies are not backed by any government or central bank, and at this point consumers are stepping into the Wild West when they engage in the market,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement.  In a consumer advisory, the agency noted that bitcoin fell as much 80 percent against the U.S. dollar in a single day this year, exposing investors to massive potential losses.  Other risks include the fact that online or virtual currencies have been a target for hackers while some virtual currency companies have provided little help in cases where funds were lost or stolen, the CFPB said.  Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, started circulating in 2009. Incidents that have brought the currency under new regulatory scrutiny include the failure of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.  Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control or backing by any government. That is something its proponents like, but it has led to calls for more oversight and guidance on issues including U.S. tax treatment.  The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network last year classified administrators or exchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters, which puts them under the remit of state regulators.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal regulator, is studying whether it has jurisdiction, given that some firms are considering offering bitcoin derivatives.  And the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has designated bitcoin and other virtual currencies as property, not currency, for tax purposes, a decision that made it less attractive to for investors to hold much value in bitcoins.  But the CFPB, a federal agency set up after the 2007-09 financial crisis, had so far been mum on the issue, causing a rebuke from the Government Accountability Office, which said last month the CFPB should step up its role in overseeing bitcoin.  The GAO’s report had been requested by Senator Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, and the head of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. Carper is conducting his own investigation into bitcoin.          Reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Tom Brown",-0.03754285714285714,0.07658858998144712

Asia’s moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin’s 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.  Even after a tumble from last week’s record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone - driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.  Over the last two weeks, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.  “After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.  “Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore,” she said. “This worries me, so I started bitcoins.”  Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region’s thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.  “Right now, it’s a form of speculation, like stocks,” said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. “I don’t think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.”  The risks, though, are rising too.  Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy.  In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchanges operate under money service operator licenses - like money changers - while in South Korea they are regulated similar to online shopping malls, trading physical goods. Often there are no rules on investor protection.  Park and Higo were drawn into bitcoin by friends. Others are attracted through seminars, social media groups and blogs penned by amateur investors.  Noboru Hanaki, a 27-year-old Japanese web marketer and bitcoin investor, said his personal finance blog gets around 30,000 page views each month. The most popular post is an explanation of bitcoin, he said, noting that when the bitcoin price surged last month, readership of the article doubled.  Rachel Poole, a Hong Kong-based kindergarten teacher, said she read about bitcoin in the press, and bought five bitcoins in March for around HK$40,000 ($5,100) after studying blogs on the topic. She kept four as an investment and has made HK$12,000 tax-free trading the fifth after classes.  “I wish I’d done it earlier,” she said.  Not everyone’s making money.   The bitcoin frenzy has spawned scams, with police in South Korea last month uncovering a $55 million cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that sucked in thousands of homemakers, workers and self-employed businessmen seduced by slick marketing and promises of wealth.  Seminars in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong promote similar multi-level marketing schemes that require investors to pay an upfront membership fee of as much as $9,000. Members are encouraged to promote the cryptocurrency and bring in new members in return for some bitcoins and other benefits.  One such Tokyo scheme offered members-only shopping websites that accept bitcoin, 24-hour assistance for car and computer problems, and bitcoin-based gifts when a member gets married, has a baby - or even dies, according to marketing materials seen by Reuters.  Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and a bitcoin investor, warned amateur investors against speculating in the digital currency.  “Trading carries huge risk: there is no investor protection and plenty of market manipulation and insider trading. Some of the exchanges cannot be trusted in my opinion.”  Some larger exchanges have voluntarily adopted security measures and compensation guarantees, according to their websites, although there are dozens of smaller platforms operating more or less unchecked.  In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has set up a task force to explore regulating cryptocurrencies, but it has not set a timeline for publishing its conclusions, an official there said.  In Japan - where memories are still fresh of the spectacular 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time - the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it supervises bitcoin exchanges, but not traders or investors.  “The government is not guaranteeing the value of cryptocurrencies. We are asking for bitcoin exchanges to fully explain the risk of sharp price moves,” an FSA official said.

410,"Bitcoin's alleged architect troubled by financial, tax issues",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0TT2WR20151210,"December 10, 2015 04:19pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australian Craig Steven Wright is the latest in a line of men alleged to be the mysterious creator of bitcoin, a digital currency that has attracted the interest of banks, speculators, criminals and regulators.  Wired magazine, which along with fellow U.S. publication Gizmodo published a story outing Wright based on a stash of leaked documents and emails, called him a genius.  But interviews with those who have done business with Wright, and a closer inspection of documents published by the two technology websites paint a more complex picture. They point to a smart but sometimes abrasive figure facing growing legal and financial problems at least in part caused by his involvement with bitcoin.  While it was not immediately possible to support or refute claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto - the person or group credited with writing the paper, protocols and software that led to bitcoin - some of those who worked with Wright raised questions about the timing of the leak and the likelihood that he was Nakamoto.  “It can’t be him, there’s no way he could have kept quiet about it this long,” said a former senior employee at Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence, who also detailed Wright’s difficulties with authorities over his Australian businesses’ bitcoin dealings.  The former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, citing legal issues, said the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014 had a direct effect on Hotwire, which is registered in Australia and is in the hands of administrators attempting to unravel disputes with the Australian Tax Office (ATO).  The collapse of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin coincided with a decision by the ATO, according to the documents, not to regard Wright’s bitcoin as money and that the digital currency therefore was taxable like any other commodity. This punctured Hotwire’s hopes it could recover more than A$3 million in tax credits and helped sink the company.  “Their cash flow disappeared right around the time Mt. Gox collapsed,” the former employee told Reuters, adding that staff at Hotwire were told that Wright had funds in a bitcoin trust, in which he was a beneficiary along with other unnamed parties.  “When they were trying to find cash flow after they were hit by Mt. Gox, they couldn’t sell the bitcoins in the trust to get the cashflow because they couldn’t break this wallet as there are other trustees.”  Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters’ attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful. Wright’s blog was taken down on Wednesday, his Twitter and Google+ accounts were deleted and access to his full LinkedIn profile restricted.  Attempts to reach Wright’s lawyer were unsuccessful and another former Hotwire employee said all staff had been instructed not to speak to the media.  Wright’s whereabouts are unknown. The landlord at his rented Sydney home told a Reuters reporter that Wright had been due to move out with his family before Christmas to move to London, where he recently attended a conference and was, according to his LinkedIn profile, enrolled for a Master’s degree at University of London.  The ATO was behind raids by Australian police on Wednesday on Wright’s home and office in Sydney. It declined to provide any further detail on the raids, citing legal confidentiality.  Administrator McGrath Nicol told creditors last month that the ATO slapped a A$1.7 million fine on Hotwire over its tax refund claims. The former Hotwire employee said Wright once paid in bitcoin to buy a banking platform from a Middle Eastern seller. He then sought to claim a goods and services tax return, or import credit, in cash worth millions of dollars which the ATO denied.  Bitcoin experts say that unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto would be significant for the industry. Not only would the proven founder likely hold some sway over the future of the bitcoin protocol, but Nakamoto may also hold enough bitcoin to influence the price of bitcoin.  “What people are looking for essentially is the Bill Gates of bitcoin,” said David Glance, a director of innovation at the University of Western Australia and noted bitcoin expert, who doubts that Wright is Nakamato, pointing to pro-capitalist, anti-hacking columns Wright wrote for The Conversation, a local publication, in 2011.  After ditching several directorships in July, Wright remains a director of three companies, including Hotwire, which had sought to launch the world’s first bitcoin bank.  McGrath Nicol noted in one report that the merging of bitcoin and cash transactions in the web of companies involving Wright “has made our review more difficult.”  Wright’s attempt to go offline in recent days contrasts with the outgoing, self-promoting figure painted by former employees, neighboring businesses at his Sydney offices and other acquaintances.  His Youtube account, now also deleted, contained videos of him rowing in the gym attempting to break records, while his LinkedIn profile contained a long list of academic qualifications.   Asked about a statement on that profile that Wright was “engaged as digital forensic expert and trainer with the Australian Federal Police”, the AFP said Wright was engaged to provide a technical report to support an investigation.  “He was really outgoing, we used to call him Mr. Bitcoin,” said an employee of a neighboring business while Wright’s offices were searched.

411,China bars banks from bitcoin transactions,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9B407L20131205,"December 05, 2013 06:23am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s government banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin on Thursday, in what analysts said was a restrained first step towards regulating the digital currency that has exploded in popularity in China and soared in value in recent months.  A statement by the central bank and four other agencies said that, while the computer-generated currency does not yet pose a threat to China’s financial system, it carries risks. It did not, however, curtail the use of bitcoin by individuals.  “I think it’s measured and it’s positive,” said Zennon Kapron, of the financial consultancy Kapronasia. “It does add legitimacy to the idea that it could be a nationwide accepted currency.”  The value of bitcoins on Chinese exchanges fell after the announcement, however, with one expert predicting the price could halve in the short-term. Digital currencies are generally highly volatile.  Bitcoins have seen their value relative to the dollar skyrocket some 800 percent in the past two months as speculators have piled into the currency, according to bitcoinity.org.  While there is no official data available, bitcoin market operators say Chinese nationals are major participants in the market and hold an outsized share of the total number of bitcoins in circulation. Shanghai-based BTC China has recently become the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume.  A statement on the website of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said that the government would act to prevent money laundering risks from bitcoin, which is not backed by a government or central bank.  The PBOC may have cause to be concerned about bitcoins, which are anonymous, untraceable, and can be carried on memory sticks or transmitted electronically, because they represent a potential hole in the country’s capital controls.  However, analysts point out that, given the tiny value of the total bitcoins in circulation relative to other currencies, it is unlikely to have much impact on the wider economy.  More cause for worry is the way these digital currencies have engendered a new wave of creative criminality focused on hacking online platforms and stealing bitcoins stored there, and their potential for use in money laundering, bribery and purchases of illicit products such as drugs and weapons.  The government will require trading platforms that deal in virtual currencies such as bitcoin to register with telecommunications authorities, it said.  The notice was issued jointly by the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission and China Insurance Regulatory Commission.  “This is an industry that will need to be governed or regulated. The safety and the well-being of the common user has to be taken into consideration. All this is expected,” said Ron Cao, Managine Director at Lightspeet Venture Partners, which recently invested $5 million in BTC China.  “‘We’ve got a long way to go. This thing needs to be regulated at some point. We’re studying it. Don’t jump into it.’ My read is that’s the tone of the message.”  Bitcoin traders sold on the Chinese government’s announcement.  On the Chinese platform FXBTC.com, the yuan-bitcoin exchange rate dropped as much as about 20 percent after the news before rebounding slightly to around 5,800 yuan per bitcoin in heavy trading.  On BTC-e, the dollar-bitcoin rate had fallen about 11 percent to about $945 from $1,063 before the news.  Cao said he would not be surprised to see the value of bitcoins fall as much as 50 percent over the next week or two.  Many bitcoin proponents say the currency’s volatility will have to flatten out before it can be adopted more widely as a near-frictionless means of payment and regulation may help.  More regulation was likely, although the initial ban on financial institutions may eventually be lifted, analysts said.  “I would be cautious about jumping the gun and taking today’s announcement as indicative as how the space will be regulated in the future,” said Mark Natkin, of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting.  “Once they have a better idea of how the market works and which players are likely to emerge as the leading players, then they’ll come out with firmer regulations, with more specific licensing requirements,” and possibly minimum capital requirements for firms entering the sector, he said.

412,Europe's first regulated bitcoin product launches in Gibraltar,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1051JN,"July 25, 2016 09:28am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s first regulated bitcoin product - an asset-backed exchange-traded instrument that will invest exclusively in the digital currency - begins trading this week on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange and Germany’s Deutsche Boerse.  The Web-based currency can be used to send money instantly around the world, free of charge and with no need for third-party checks. It is accepted by several major online retailers and is used in more than 200,000 daily transactions.  Its value has been highly volatile, peaking at more than$1,200 in late 2013 before crashing after the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange. It has since stabilized somewhat, trading at around $655 on Monday, up more than 50 percent this year.  BitcoinETI will be available through regulated brokerages across Europe, and settlement will be handled through Clearstream and Euroclear, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange said, rather than via bitcoin’s shared ledger system - the blockchain.  In the United States, where regulation of bitcoin and financial technology more broadly tends to be more onerous, twins Cameron and Tyles Winklevoss - entrepreneurs who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their idea - have been waiting for approval for a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund for three years.  Their proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would be the first ETF issued by a U.S. entity that invests solely in bitcoin.  Another ETF issued by New York-based ARK Investment Management last year became the first ETF to invest in bitcoin, but it also invests in other fintech companies.  The new European ETI, issued by Gibraltar-based iStructure PCC and sponsored by one of its subsidies, Revoltura, comes as a result of talks between stakeholders, including the Financial Services Commission - Gibraltar’s regulator - and the British Overseas Territory’s government.  “By listing the ETI on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, which is an EU-regulated market, we are able to bring a high level of transparency and liquidity to investors,” said Revoltura CEO Ransu Salovaara.

413,"China's OkCoin, Huobi exchanges to stop bitcoin withdrawals",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15P0HE,"February 10, 2017 01:07am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Two of China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges said they were taking measures to stop withdrawals of the cryptocurrency from their platforms, as capital outflows prompt the Chinese central bank to step up its scrutiny of the industry.   OkCoin and Huobi said in statements published on their websites late on Thursday that they would halt withdrawals of bitcoins completely, while the other big exchange BTCC said it would subject withdrawals to a 72-hour review.   Earlier in the day, the exchanges had issued statements saying they would strengthen oversight of customers’ identities and sources of funds. They had also said they would upgrade their anti-money laundering systems, but that withdrawals of Chinese yuan would not be affected.   These measures come after China’s central bank said it called nine of the country’s smaller bitcoin exchanges in to a Wednesday meeting to discuss risks in the bitcoin market, and warned them they risked closure if they seriously violated regulations or took part in activities such as margin lending.   Bitcoin prices on European exchange Bitstamp were down 0.8 percent on Friday, trading at $975.61.  Beijing signaled it was keeping a closer eye on the bitcoin industry last month by launching checks into BTCC, Huobi and OkCoin, amid growing government efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on China’s currency, the yuan.   While the yuan weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price has soared to near-record highs.]  That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency offers, has prompted some to believe bitcoin has become an attractive option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.  BTCC, Huobi and OkCoin last month stopped margin lending and introduced trading fees after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) launched checks into them.  In their Thursday statements, they also said they may freeze assets or limit trading by users who were found to flout rules. The statements contained links to documents published by China’s banking regulator warning investors about market risks.   News of meetings between the various exchanges and the PBOC, and other government agencies has caused the bitcoin price to swing wildly.  On Wednesday, the price fell from a one-month high after sources at bitcoin exchanges in China said the PBOC had summoned some exchanges to a closed-door meeting, before recovering all of those losses in U.S. and European time.  The PBOC said the nine exchanges involved in the Wednesday meeting were CHBTC, BtcTrade, HaoBTC, Yunbi, Yuanbao, BTC100, Jubi, BitBays and Dahonghuo. Industry insiders said the majority of these exchanges allowed other cryptocurrencies to be traded on their platforms besides bitcoin.   BtcTrade, Bitbays and BTC100 declined to comment on the meeting. Reuters was unable to immediately reach the other six platforms for comment.  The Chinese actions will ultimately be good for the industry, said Charles Hayter, Chief Executive Officer of London-based digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare.  “The PBOC moves to regulate Bitcoin more stringently will bring short-term woes but will ultimately strengthen the ecosystem,” he said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  According to Hayter, trading between the Chinese yuan and bitcoin has fallen to around 26 percent of the bitcoin-fiat currency market from 98 percent at the start of the year.

414,Bitcoin pioneer calls for regulatory guidance from EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0F827J20140703,"July 03, 2014 02:24pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe should update its laws to reflect the rise of digital currencies, the head of a bitcoin start-up said, after a successful U.S. auction of bitcoins was seen as a sign of their broadening appeal.  The virtual currency has come under the scrutiny of regulators in both the United States and Europe following a series of high-profile scandals such as the bankruptcy of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  But authorities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have not yet taken a uniform approach to regulating the nascent digital currency, and have limited themselves to issuing warnings about its risks for investors.  “One of the challenges is that without clear guidance from the EU, from the UK, it will limit industry development,” said Jeremy Allaire, head of Circle, a bitcoin consumer finance company that allows people to use and store bitcoins online.  “Unless they have a clear view of where does this (bitcoin) fit, how do we know what the rules are?” he said in an interview with Reuters.  Launched in 2009, bitcoin offers a way for people to conduct transactions over the Internet. Its backers say its anonymity - users do not need to reveal any card or financial details when making payments - protects people from fraud. Critics say this also makes it easier to commit crimes like buying illegal drugs online.  Last October U.S. authorities seized 144,000 bitcoins online in a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar that authorities said had been used for illegal drug transactions. Some of those bitcoins were auctioned off last week.  Allaire said bitcoins could be regulated in the same way as  other payment services such as PayPal, with strict consumer protection safeguards so people would feel safer using them.  The EU’s law regulating payment services should be updated to reflect the use of bitcoins, he added.  Bitcoin supporters maintain that digital currencies are set to expand further and that as they become more mainstream the price volatility and scams that have so far bedevilled them will decrease.   In June online travel agency Expedia began accepting bitcoins as a form of payment.  “As bigger exchanges get built and you see it move from retail and speculative investors to more traditional institutional investors ... you’ll see greater price stability,” said Allaire.  Last week’s auction of almost 30,000 bitcoins by the U.S. law enforcement authorities attracted bids from several high-profile investors, such as U.S. investment firm Pantera Capital.   The auction was won by one bidder, Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper, who called it a vote of confidence by the U.S. government in the nascent crypto-currency.   Allaire said authorities on both sides of the Atlantic were starting to come to terms with the rise of digital currency after initially shunning it.  “A number of these regulatory bodies have started to analyze it and look at the risks,” he said. “Most scratched their heads at the beginning and said ‘do I need to care about this? I just want it to go away.’”  Editing by Mark Trevelyan",0.11539285714285714,0.030867346938775513
415,Bitcoin firms explore U.S. rules for derivative exchanges,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0MG1AJ20140319,"March 19, 2014 07:35pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Companies have inquired in the past month about regulations that would govern exchanges for bitcoin derivatives, a top U.S. regulator said on Wednesday, a sign such virtual currencies could become a more mainstream financial product.  Regulators have stepped up their efforts to rein in bitcoin after incidents such as the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.  The novelty of the technology has made it hard for regulators to categorize bitcoin, but trading derivatives such as futures or swaps would subject companies to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “Let me tell you, (if) they’ve got a derivatives contract, we have jurisdiction... and we should regulate it,” Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters in an interview.  In the past 30 days, a number of companies requested information to see what the rules were for setting up a market place to trade bitcoin derivatives, Chilton said.  “These are people that are inquiring about what they should do if they wanted to request (official) status,” he said.  He declined to name the companies, which have not officially filed any paperwork to get legal status, he said.  Chilton is set to leave the commission on Friday after more than six years with the regulator.  Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control, or any backing, by a government or a central bank - something its proponents like, but that also makes it vulnerable to mishaps.  New York state’s top financial services regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, has been the most vocal about regulating bitcoin, saying last week that he wants prospective virtual currency exchange operators to submit formal applications.  The CFTC, which regulates futures and swaps, is also studying whether it should regulate the new electronic currencies, its head said last week.

416,"Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18T0K2,"June 02, 2017 04:20pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (Corrects June 2 story to remove reference to bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ status in Japan as “legal tender.”)  By Minami Funakoshi and Joyce Lee  TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Long the preserve of geeky enthusiasts, bitcoin is going mainstream in Asia, attracting Mrs Watanabe - the metaphorical Japanese housewife investor - South Korean retirees and thousands of others trying to escape rock-bottom savings rates by investing in the cryptocurrency.  Asia’s moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin’s 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.  Even after a tumble from last week’s record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone - driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.  Over the last two weeks, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.  “After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.  “Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore,” she said. “This worries me, so I started bitcoins.”  Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region’s thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.  “Right now, it’s a form of speculation, like stocks,” said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. “I don’t think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.”  The risks, though, are rising too.  Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy.  In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchanges operate under money service operator licenses - like money changers - while in South Korea they are regulated similar to online shopping malls, trading physical goods. Often there are no rules on investor protection.  Park and Higo were drawn into bitcoin by friends. Others are attracted through seminars, social media groups and blogs penned by amateur investors.  Noboru Hanaki, a 27-year-old Japanese web marketer and bitcoin investor, said his personal finance blog gets around 30,000 page views each month. The most popular post is an explanation of bitcoin, he said, noting that when the bitcoin price surged last month, readership of the article doubled.  Rachel Poole, a Hong Kong-based kindergarten teacher, said she read about bitcoin in the press, and bought five bitcoins in March for around HK$40,000 ($5,100) after studying blogs on the topic. She kept four as an investment and has made HK$12,000 tax-free trading the fifth after classes.  “I wish I’d done it earlier,” she said.  Not everyone’s making money.   The bitcoin frenzy has spawned scams, with police in South Korea last month uncovering a $55 million cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that sucked in thousands of homemakers, workers and self-employed businessmen seduced by slick marketing and promises of wealth.  Seminars in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong promote similar multi-level marketing schemes that require investors to pay an upfront membership fee of as much as $9,000. Members are encouraged to promote the cryptocurrency and bring in new members in return for some bitcoins and other benefits.  One such Tokyo scheme offered members-only shopping websites that accept bitcoin, 24-hour assistance for car and computer problems, and bitcoin-based gifts when a member gets married, has a baby - or even dies, according to marketing materials seen by Reuters.  Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and a bitcoin investor, warned amateur investors against speculating in the digital currency.  “Trading carries huge risk: there is no investor protection and plenty of market manipulation and insider trading. Some of the exchanges cannot be trusted in my opinion.”  Some larger exchanges have voluntarily adopted security measures and compensation guarantees, according to their websites, although there are dozens of smaller platforms operating more or less unchecked.  In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has set up a task force to explore regulating cryptocurrencies, but it has not set a timeline for publishing its conclusions, an official there said.  In Japan - where memories are still fresh of the spectacular 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time - the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it supervises bitcoin exchanges, but not traders or investors.  “The government is not guaranteeing the value of cryptocurrencies. We are asking for bitcoin exchanges to fully explain the risk of sharp price moves,” an FSA official said.  Some professional investors say bitcoin can be a useful hedge to help diversify a portfolio, but investors should be cautious.  “This is an extremely volatile and innovative asset class,” said Pietro Ventani, managing director of APP Advisers, an asset allocation strategy firm.

The SEC announced in a filing its decision denying Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s NYSE Arca exchange the ability to list and trade the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded product (ETP) that would trade like a stock and track the digital asset’s price. Previously, the regulatory agency said it had concerns with a similar proposal by investors Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss.  “The Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,” the SEC said in its filing, echoing language from its decision earlier this month on the application by CBOE Holdings Inc’s Bats exchange to list The Bitcoin ETF proposed by the Winklevoss brothers. On Friday, Bats asked the SEC to review its decision not to allow that fund to trade.  “We are reviewing the SEC’s order and evaluating our next steps,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, chief executive officer of SolidX Partners Inc, a U.S. technology company that provides blockchain services. NYSE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bitcoin had scaled to a record of more than $1,300 this month, higher than the price of an ounce of gold, as investors speculated that an ETF holding the digital currency could woo more people into buying the asset.  But after denial of the Winklevoss-proposed ETF, the digital currency’s price plunged as much as 18 percent. It has rebounded partially since then and was at $1,041 on Tuesday, roughly unchanged from the previous day.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.  Yet bitcoin presents a new set of risks to investors given its limited adoption, a number of massive cybersecurity breaches affecting bitcoin owners and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.  There is one remaining bitcoin ETP proposal awaiting a verdict from the SEC.

The tiny, producing mine is being offered for sale by an unidentified seller on BitPremier, a self-described bitcoin marketplace for “luxury items and opportunities”.  The mine, located right in Dawson City, the heart of the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, has the potential to produce up to 4,000 ounces of gold a year, worth $5.9 million at current prices. The sale includes $1 million worth of equipment.  “A well-respected, fully compliant and profitable company, any new buyer could recoup their initial investment in as little as two mining seasons,” the sales advertisement says. It does not say whether the owner would consider any other form of payment besides bitcoins.   Prices for gold have slumped by a third in the past 2-1/2 years after a decade-long rally, leaving many mines struggling to stay profitable.   Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of so-called virtual currencies created by computers and accepted by some retailers as payment on the Internet or in shops.

Draper, a major backer of Vaurum, will partner with the startup to use the coins as a liquidity source for Vaurum’s trading platforms in emerging markets, Draper told reporters in Palo Alto on Wednesday.  “If they thought that they were going to try to put the kibosh on bitcoin, I think they would have just buried these,” Draper said, referring to the government’s stance on the currency. “Instead, they decided that this was of real value to society.”  The bitcoins, a virtual currency that is “mined” by computers solving complex algorithms, were seized last year by the Marshals Service in a crackdown on illegal online activity.       Acceptance of bitcoin has been growing as more merchants allow customers to pay for goods and services with the currency.  The U.S. Marshals Service auctioned off 29,655 bitcoins at an estimated worth of about $18 million in an online, sealed-bid auction that drew more than 40 bidders, including a number of well-known players in the crypto-currency. Terms of the sale have not been disclosed, but the success gives the virtual currency more legitimacy as a means of exchange.  The bitcoins auctioned off were part of 144,000 bitcoins seized in October in a raid on Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar that authorities said had been used for illegal drug transactions and other goods.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service said it will not conduct another auction of bitcoins unless there is a court order for the agency to do so.  Draper told reporters his next fund will sport “a very high concentration” of bitcoin related investments.      “Of course, no one is totally secure in holding their own country’s currency. We want to enable people to hold and trade bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies,” the Vaurum statement said.          Draper is from a prominent Silicon Valley family, the son of one of the nation’s first venture capitalists and father of another. In 1985 he founded Draper Associates, which would grow into Draper Fisher Jurvetson, known for investments such as online communication service Skype, electric carmaker Tesla and Chinese web services company Baidu.  Like many in Silicon Valley, Draper has embraced bitcoin. With its open internet architecture and growing use as an alternative currency, it appeals to venture capitalists fond of open and disruptive technologies.   Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures back bitcoin wallet Coinbase and Lightspeed Ventures backs bitcoin exchange BTC China.  In addition to Draper, Vaurum has backing from former AOL Chief Executive Officer Steve Case and Battery Ventures.

The company made $34.1 million in revenue from the new bitcoin offering in the first quarter of this year, but its bitcoin costs were $33.9 million, according to a May shareholder letter.  Proponents of bitcoin say that it can help democratize finance by offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and conduct transactions more cheaply.

Bitcoins are created through a “mining” process involving computer algorithms on equipment owned or rented out by companies such as Iceland-based Genesis. Bitcoins, which are worth more than $400 each, can be purchased from trading exchanges such as BitStamp and Kraken.  The Logos Fund was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Genesis said in a statement. The fund will issue “pooled investment fund interests” to investors in an offering expected to last more than a year.  Genesis will initially seed the fund with $1 million of its own capital, co-founder and Chief Executive Marco Streng said, adding that investors have expressed an interest in putting in $100 million.  The mininum investment for the fund is $25,000.  “The fund would be clearly focused on bitcoin mining, but we can also purchase bitcoins directly from the exchanges,” said Streng said in an interview.  Streng cited strong investor interest despite challenges facing the sector, whose profits have been pressured by growing competition.  More than $1 billion has been invested in bitcoin-related startups since 2013.  Bitcoin on Thursday traded at $416.01 on the BitStamp platform, down 1.8 percent.

427,Regulator mulls setting rules for digital currency Bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9450Y520130506,"May 06, 2013 06:32pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. derivatives regulator is considering whether the Bitcoin virtual currency should be subject to its rules, a top official at the agency said.  Bart Chilton, one of five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said he had asked staff to explore whether consumers needed more protection from any mishaps with Bitcoin, whose value collapsed last month.  “Here’s what I know for sure: we could regulate it if we wanted. That is very clear,” Chilton told Reuters in an interview on Monday. The Financial Times was first to report on Chilton’s plans.  Bitcoin, a digital currency that can be moved via computer or smartphone without a financial intermediary, has gained in prominence as people start to question the safety of holding their cash in the bank. It shot up in value in March, when investors took fright at the next turn of the euro zone debt crisis.  But the price of one “coin” plunged to $130 from a record high of $260 on April 10.  The CFTC’s remit has been vastly expanded after the 2007-09 financial crisis when it was tasked with writing rules for the $650 trillion swaps market.  “There is potentially a federal role here, and we have to make sure that we’re on guard that whatever is traded is appropriately regulated,” Chilton said.  Chilton is an often outspoken Democrat on the CFTC’s board, and the adoption of any regulation he is pushing for depends on the support of the others on the board, as well as what the CFTC’s lawyers and other experts say.  A spokesman for the CFTC declined to comment.  The absence of physical Bitcoins meant people investing in the currency to speculate on a rise in its value could not be said to participate in cash markets, Chilton said, bringing them within the remit of the CFTC’s mandate.  “If you’re buying Bitcoin and you are hoping that their value increases ... and you could purchase something with them in a day or a week or a month or a year, that is clearly a derivative of the actual Bitcoin,” Chilton said.  The U.S. Treasury Department in March said that Bitcoin exchanges would be subject to the same money laundering rules that govern money services business like Western Union.

430,UPDATE 1-JPMorgan's Dimon regrets calling bitcoin a 'fraud' - Fox,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1P4434,"January 09, 2018 09:25am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon regrets having called bitcoin a “fraud” but would still not be interested in the cryptocurrency, he said in an interview on Fox Business on Tuesday.  Dimon, known for his candid comments, slammed the viability of bitcoin in September. “The currency isn’t going to work. You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart,” he had said at a conference.  The buzz generated by Dimon’s comments spurred more interest in the alt-currency. Bitcoin rose around 30 percent in one month following Dimon’s speech, where he also compared the currency to tulips bulbs in a reference to the famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Dimon's comments were followed by a more tempered view from Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who said the bank was ""very open minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated."" (reut.rs/2mies8H)  Despite Dimon’s criticism, several banks, exchange operators and companies eagerly embraced bitcoin, sparking a spectacular rise in the ctyptocurrency.  On Tuesday, bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down nearly 5 percent at $14,202 in early trading. It traded at $909 a year ago and breached $19,000 in December.  Exchange operators such as CME Group Inc (CME.O) and Cboe Global Markets Inc CBOE.O opened their platforms to allow bitcoin futures trading, while Square Inc (SQ.N) rolled out a bitcoin buying/selling feature on its app to a select few. (reut.rs/2AHz1Q1) (reut.rs/2AK55Tq)  Dimon and Lake, however, have commended blockchain - the technology used by bitcoin and other digital currencies - a view echoed by Citigroup Inc (C.N) CFO John Gerspach and many others across the industry.

433,U.S. states take lead in writing bitcoin rules,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4G08P20140517,"May 17, 2014 04:05pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A task force of U.S. state regulators is working on the first bitcoin rule-book, the head of the group said, hoping to protect users of virtual currency from fraud without smothering the fledgling technology.  Numerous companies in the United States enable customers to pay for goods and services in virtual currencies. But since bitcoins are not regulated by the federal government, users face a maze of rules in the 50 states.  “We may be looking at some type of model definitions, or model laws or regulations, and very likely recommendations to either our federal colleagues or to Congress,” David Cotney, Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, told Reuters on the sidelines of a public hearing into the issue on Friday.  Cotney was appointed in February to head the new Emerging Payments Task Force, a group of nine members of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS). He said the task force had given itself roughly a year to complete the task.  The task force was hoping for a clearer definition of which operators needed to be regulated and which ones did not, Cotney said in the interview.  “Who’s in and who’s out? So if we can offer that (it) would be a ... big step,” he said. Cotney’s group also looks at other new payment technologies, such as mobile phone payments, and PayPal, an online money transfer service.  Bitcoin is the most prominent of a group of so-called virtual currencies created by computers and governed by the Bitcoin Foundation, outside the control of any government. Some retailers accept bitcoins as payment on the Internet or in shops.  But recent mishaps have brought the technology under heightened scrutiny. Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of client bitcoins.  State regulators say they will not stand in the way of virtual currency operators entering their states, but they want to ensure the business is safe.  Task force member Benjamin Lawksy, the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, in January said his department was working on a “BitLicense”. California is another state that has shown interest.  So far, federal regulators have been relatively mum. The Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) last year classified administrators or exchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters, which puts them under the remit of state regulators.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is studying whether it has jurisdiction, given that some firms are considering offering bitcoin derivatives. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has designated bitcoin as property, not currency.  Reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by David Gregorio",0.12786799999999998,0.06566666666666665

437,"Regulatory fears hammer bitcoin below $10,000, half its peak",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F60CH,"January 17, 2018 03:11pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell as much as 20 percent on Wednesday, piercing below $10,000, while other cryptocurrencies took similar spills due to investor fears that regulators could clamp down on them in an effort to curb speculation.  The world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency at one point lost 30 percent of its value since Tuesday. Bitcoin, despite some stabilization in late U.S. trading, was half its record peak of almost $20,000 set on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange a month ago.  Ethereum and Ripple, the No. 2 and No. 3 virtual currencies, tumbled after reports South Korea and China could ban cryptocurrency trading, sparking worries of a wider regulatory crackdown.  “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies.   “You have more regulatory uncertainty ... and because of these falls, you have these other fallouts,” he said, referring to the collapse of some cryptocurrencies in the recent slump in prices.  Analysts at Citi said on Wednesday bitcoin could halve again in value amid the current rout, adding that a possible fall to a range between $5,605 and $5,673 “looks very likely to be very speedy”.  With South Korea, Japan and China all making noises about a regulatory swoop, and officials in France and the United States vowing to investigate cryptocurrencies, there are concerns that global coordination on how to regulate them will accelerate.  Officials are expected to debate the rise of bitcoin at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina in March.    “Cryptocurrencies could be capped in the current quarter ahead of the G20 meeting in March, where policymakers could discuss tighter regulations,” said Shuhei Fujise, chief analyst at Alt Design.  The current rout in bitcoin and other digital currencies was a far cry from their dramatic run-up in 2017 when mainstream investors jumped on the bandwagon and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital, token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand.  “Bitcoin is deciding whether this is the moment to crash and burn,” said Steven Englander, head of strategy at New York-based Rafiki Capital.  Bitcoin has plummeted before.   There have been nine instances including the current selloff going back to 2011 where bitcoin’s price was halved on the Bitstamp exchange. The last time was from November 2014 to January 2015.  On Wednesday, bitcoin fell as low as $9,222 on Bitstamp, its lowest price since Dec. 1, as CBOE and CME bitcoin futures tumbled to contract lows.  The latest market losses stemmed from reports that South Korea’s finance minister said banning trading in cryptocurrencies is still an option and that Seoul plans a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.  Separately, a senior Chinese central banker said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services.  “My conjecture is that cryptocurrency holders are trying to decide whether to abandon bitcoin because its limitations mean it will be superseded by better products or bet that it can thrive despite them,” Englander said.  While many observers say the recent falls show that the bubble has burst, those backing the nascent markets say that regulation is welcomed and wild price swings to be expected.  “The volatility of bitcoin - and other cryptocurrencies - is an expected, and important, part of the journey to becoming a mature asset class. We expect the volatility to continue throughout 2018 but fundamentally believe that bitcoin is still in a bull market,” said Christopher Keshian, co-founder of $APEX Token Fund.   Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 15 percent since Tuesday, according to website CoinMarketCap.  Ripple, the third-biggest, has lost 18 percent of its value over the past 24 hours and was quoted at $1.03, down from a high of $3.81 on Jan. 4.     “The run-up in bitcoin created a mystique of one-way trading which is being shaken, but the pricing requires faith that there will always be demand,” Englander wrote in a research note.  “This is far from guaranteed given the existence of alternatives with better characteristics.”     Graphic - A Rollercoaster Month for Bitcoin: reut.rs/2DHtz2Q  Reporting by Tommy Wilkes in London and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo, Writing by Vidya Ranganathan and Tommy Wilkes; Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London and Richard Leong in New York; editing by Mark Heinrich and Nick Zieminski",-0.09551515151515151,0.013129254303496726

Some websites help to arrange private transactions between buyers and sellers.  LocalBitcoins.com is a popular website through which buyers and sellers advertise bitcoins, setting their own prices and conducting trades privately. It is operated by two brothers in Helsinki who say it has about 350,000 active users from nearly every country.  The website has recently been facilitating trades worth as much as $72 million a week and may surpass $1 billion worth of bitcoin transactions this year, according to Nikolaus Kangas, its 31-year-old chief executive. His older brother Jeremias, a programmer, set up LocalBitcoins five years ago. It now has about 15 employees and is looking to hire more.  Here’s how it works: Bitcoin buyers and sellers place advertisements on LocalBitcoins. The website holds a seller’s bitcoins in escrow. A seller releases them to a buyer upon being paid. LocalBitcoins collects a one percent fee in bitcoins for each completed transaction. This year those fees may add up to more than $10 million worth of bitcoins.  Many of the customers are unknown to the two Finns. Providing identification is voluntary. Nikolaus Kangas said about 70 percent of active clients provide ID details; the rest give only a username and email address.  “Right now we don’t require it,” he said. “We’ve been considering making ID mandatory.”  While some LocalBitcoins sellers require bitcoin buyers to identify themselves, some have openly advertised that they don’t. “I accept funds without any security check,” stated one seller who went by the user name “wmarbitr” and advertised in Russian and English. The website said he had conducted more than 3,000 confirmed trades on LocalBitcoins with more than 4,200 buyers and sellers.

439,"UPDATE 3-Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies tumble on govt crackdown worries",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1PB1U1,"January 16, 2018 12:03pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid as much as 18 percent on Tuesday to a four-week low, as worries about a regulatory crackdown on the market spread after reports suggested it was still possible that South Korea could ban trading in cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin’s slide triggered a selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day at one point, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next biggest, Ripple, plunging by as much as a third.  Bitcoin traded as low as $11,191.59 (£8,127) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  In New York trading, it edged up to $12,078, but that was still down 11.2 percent, leaving it on track for its biggest one-day fall since September.   “With reports on a renewed crackdown on the cryptocurrency in China fuelling anxiety over future restrictions, further losses could be on the cards (for bitcoin) in the near term,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM in the UK.  “The sharp depreciation witnessed in bitcoin today should remind investors on how explosively volatile and unpredictable the cryptocurrency can be,” he added.   South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.  South Korea said on Monday its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalised, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market.  That came amid news that a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies and prohibit individuals and businesses from providing related services.  China shut down exchanges operating on the mainland last year - a move that also sparked a selloff, though the market later recovered.   “It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting (bitcoin), with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.  “But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,” he said.  Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum.   The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down around 40 percent from a record high near $20,000 hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its total market value - the unit price multiplied by the number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.  “From a technical standpoint, bitcoin is under pressure on the daily charts,” said Otunuga. “The breakdown below $12,000 may encourage a further decline towards $11,000 and $10,000, respectively.”  A director at Germany’s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community.  The latest plunge in the market came as wealth management firm deVere Group, which has $12 billion under advisement, said it was launching a cryptocurrency app that would allow users to store, transfer and exchange five of the biggest digital coins, citing “soaring global demand.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly in London and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Robin Pomeroy and Frances Kerry",-0.08699444444444443,0.011828750467639355

442,Egypt's first bitcoin exchange to begin trading this month,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1L33NK,"August 17, 2017 06:52am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"* Exchange will allow trade in Egyptian pounds  * Bitcoin value has surged in recent months  * Egypt has not yet regulated digital currency  By Eric Knecht  CAIRO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Egypt’s first bitcoin exchange will go live later this month, the founders of Bitcoin Egypt said, linking the Middle East’s most populous country with a cryptocurrency that has surged in value in recent months.  Many governments around the world are still mulling how to regulate and classify bitcoin, a volatile digital currency that has captured the interest of speculative investors worldwide as its value has soared, roughly quadrupling since the start of 2017 and trading at around $4,400 on Thursday.  Egypt, most of whose 93 million people have no bank accounts but where electronic payments have grown in recent years, lacks regulations for digital currency. This means local retailers cannot accept it as payment but users on an exchange may be left to trade freely, potentially cashing in on its ascent.  “We’re still waiting on the Egyptian government to set some kind of regulations...Without any laws, bitcoin is not legal money in Egypt,” said Bitcoin Egypt founder Rami Khalil.  He said the exchange has picked up about 300 pre-registrations from users ahead of its launch.  The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, the country’s financial markets regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.  Khalil and co-founder Omar Abdelrasoul see their platform connecting a community of several thousand bitcoin enthusiasts who will for the first time be able to trade in Egyptian pounds, which have roughly halved in value since November after flotation under an International Monetary Fund loan programme.  “Cryptoassets are happening whether (the Egyptian government) joins in or not. And by not joining they’re missing out on a very big market. Currently bitcoin is about a $70 billion market,” said Khalil.  Cryptocurrencies allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks.  Bitcoin’s lack of central authority makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls. This has helped it proliferate in China, the world’s most active bitcoin market, but has led some governments to crack down on its use to prevent money laundering.  Those same dynamics could propel bitcoin in Egypt, where a shortage of hard currency after the 2011 uprising sharply restricted bank transfers. Though liquidity at banks has improved and capital controls have been lifted in recent months, businesses still resort to a black market for dollars to obtain currency not available in the formal banking system.  “We’re trying to get people used to the idea of bitcoin, to ready the market so that in a couple of years we will reach a greater number of users. But for now we are trying to let people know what cryptocurrency is,” said Abdelrasoul. (Reporting by Eric Knecht; editing by Mark Heinrich)",0.20871578947368422,0.06579235335814285

444,"Regulatory fears hammer bitcoin below $10,000, half its peak",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F60CH,"January 17, 2018 03:11pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell as much as 20 percent on Wednesday, piercing below $10,000, while other cryptocurrencies took similar spills due to investor fears that regulators could clamp down on them in an effort to curb speculation.  The world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency at one point lost 30 percent of its value since Tuesday. Bitcoin, despite some stabilization in late U.S. trading, was half its record peak of almost $20,000 set on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange a month ago.  Ethereum and Ripple, the No. 2 and No. 3 virtual currencies, tumbled after reports South Korea and China could ban cryptocurrency trading, sparking worries of a wider regulatory crackdown.  “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies.   “You have more regulatory uncertainty ... and because of these falls, you have these other fallouts,” he said, referring to the collapse of some cryptocurrencies in the recent slump in prices.  Analysts at Citi said on Wednesday bitcoin could halve again in value amid the current rout, adding that a possible fall to a range between $5,605 and $5,673 “looks very likely to be very speedy”.  With South Korea, Japan and China all making noises about a regulatory swoop, and officials in France and the United States vowing to investigate cryptocurrencies, there are concerns that global coordination on how to regulate them will accelerate.  Officials are expected to debate the rise of bitcoin at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina in March.    “Cryptocurrencies could be capped in the current quarter ahead of the G20 meeting in March, where policymakers could discuss tighter regulations,” said Shuhei Fujise, chief analyst at Alt Design.  The current rout in bitcoin and other digital currencies was a far cry from their dramatic run-up in 2017 when mainstream investors jumped on the bandwagon and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital, token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand.  “Bitcoin is deciding whether this is the moment to crash and burn,” said Steven Englander, head of strategy at New York-based Rafiki Capital.  Bitcoin has plummeted before.   There have been nine instances including the current selloff going back to 2011 where bitcoin’s price was halved on the Bitstamp exchange. The last time was from November 2014 to January 2015.  On Wednesday, bitcoin fell as low as $9,222 on Bitstamp, its lowest price since Dec. 1, as CBOE and CME bitcoin futures tumbled to contract lows.  The latest market losses stemmed from reports that South Korea’s finance minister said banning trading in cryptocurrencies is still an option and that Seoul plans a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.  Separately, a senior Chinese central banker said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services.  “My conjecture is that cryptocurrency holders are trying to decide whether to abandon bitcoin because its limitations mean it will be superseded by better products or bet that it can thrive despite them,” Englander said.  While many observers say the recent falls show that the bubble has burst, those backing the nascent markets say that regulation is welcomed and wild price swings to be expected.  “The volatility of bitcoin - and other cryptocurrencies - is an expected, and important, part of the journey to becoming a mature asset class. We expect the volatility to continue throughout 2018 but fundamentally believe that bitcoin is still in a bull market,” said Christopher Keshian, co-founder of $APEX Token Fund.   Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 15 percent since Tuesday, according to website CoinMarketCap.  Ripple, the third-biggest, has lost 18 percent of its value over the past 24 hours and was quoted at $1.03, down from a high of $3.81 on Jan. 4.     “The run-up in bitcoin created a mystique of one-way trading which is being shaken, but the pricing requires faith that there will always be demand,” Englander wrote in a research note.  “This is far from guaranteed given the existence of alternatives with better characteristics.”     Graphic - A Rollercoaster Month for Bitcoin: reut.rs/2DHtz2Q  Reporting by Tommy Wilkes in London and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo, Writing by Vidya Ranganathan and Tommy Wilkes; Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London and Richard Leong in New York; editing by Mark Heinrich and Nick Zieminski",-0.09551515151515151,0.013129254303496726
445,Chinese bitcoin exchanges resume withdrawals after freeze,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18S42X,"June 01, 2017 05:18am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Major Chinese bitcoin exchanges have started to resume allowing withdrawals of the cryptocurrency after nearly a four-month freeze that followed increased scrutiny from the central bank.  Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTCChina, said in a statement on Thursday that his exchange had started “testing” withdrawals after upgrading its “know your customer” and anti-money laundering systems.  Huobi, another exchange, said in a statement it would resume withdrawals on Thursday.  Two industry sources said OkCoin, China’s third major cryptocurrency exchange, had resumed allowing withdrawals. A spokeswoman for OkCoin declined to comment but referred Reuters to an industry news outlet that reported on the resumption.  As the popularity of bitcoin spread, China quickly evolved into the world’s leading venue for bitcoin trading. But volumes collapsed after the People’s Bank of China began looking into the market more closely and conducting checks of the exchanges at the start of this year.  Major exchanges halted withdrawals of bitcoins in early February, introduced trading fees and stepped up scrutiny of clients amid discussions with authorities.  While withdrawals were suspended, investors could buy and sell bitcoins on Chinese exchanges but were barred from transferring them or downloading and removing them.  One of the industry sources said the decision to resume withdrawals was made after the central bank had signaled that it was not forbidden. BTCChina and OkCoin were allowing customers to withdraw a maximum of 10 bitcoins a day, the source said.  It remained unclear when more formal regulation of the industry would begin, the person added.  The decision to resume withdrawals comes with the price of bitcoin near an all-time high. Prices on European exchange Bitstamp were around $2,400 on Thursday - up nearly 150 percent from the start of the year.  The intensified regulator interest in bitcoin coincided with a clampdown on capital outflows, as authorities sought to relieve downward pressure on the yuan currency and stop the depletion of China’s foreign exchange reserves.  Bitcoin’s relative anonymity prompted some industry observers to say it had become an attractive, if niche, option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals could buy each year.  The yuan has stymied forecasts it would continue to fall after losing about 6.5 percent against the dollar last year. It is up more than 2 percent since the start of the year.

448,Prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur charged with money laundering,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0Q15N20140128,"January 27, 2014 07:31pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road.  Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin’s biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said on Monday.  Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1 million bond.  “At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent,” his lawyer Keith Miller said.  The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired with a Florida resident, Robert Faiella, who ran an illegal exchange, to sell more than $1 million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which was shuttered by authorities last year.  Faiella, 52, is also charged in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was arrested at his home in Coral Gables, Florida. At his court hearing on Monday in federal court in Florida, Faiella consented to detention until Wednesday, at which point there will be a bail hearing.  Shrem could not be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Faiella’s house and declined to be identified said, “Nobody wants to talk.”  Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital “wallets.”  The criminal complaint says that Shrem, in addition to knowing that Faiella’s business was funneling money into Silk Road, also used Silk Road himself to buy drugs, including marijuana-infused brownies.  “When Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,” Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement emailed to the press on Monday. “We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”  Bharara has said recently that prosecutors are not going after Bitcoin itself and view it as they view any other currency in which transactions are sometimes made illegally.  U.S. law enforcement officials have vowed to pursue any criminal activity in the nascent Bitcoin world as regulators try to formulate their approach to the digital currency.  The charging of a prominent Bitcoin Foundation official may be a blow to Bitcoin’s prospects, though it did not have a huge immediate impact on trading. Bitcoins were exchanging hands at $970 late on Monday, down from prices above $1,000 earlier this month but up from around $150 four months ago on the Tokyo-based exchange MtGox.  Winklevoss Capital, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, invested in BitInstant in 2012 and led a capital-raising effort last May that raised $1.5 million. The twins, who are best known for their failed lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in which they had claimed he had stolen their idea for an online social networking platform at Harvard, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  “When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,” the Winkelvoss twins said in a statement. “Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest,” they said. “We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.”  As part of the conditions of his bail, Shrem will be confined to his parents’ home in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. A report prepared by the court for his bail hearing listed his net worth at $6 million, according to U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. Serrin Turner, an assistant U.S. attorney, opposed bail, saying Shrem had a “strong incentive to flee” and the means to do so.  Bitcoin insiders said Shrem’s arrest showed just how hard it is to get away with illegal activity using Bitcoin, which has an ownership chain built into its software so that each unit can be tied to the users who have acquired or spent it.  “Using bitcoin for illicit transactions is really, really dumb,” said Patrick Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation’s general counsel. “Bitcoins are so easy to track.”  According to the charges, Faiella, going by “BTCKing” online, sold bitcoins to Silk Road users and passed on purchase orders he received from the site to Shrem, who filled them, transferring funds to Faiella’s account at an unidentified bitcoin exchange service based in Japan.  The charging document says that Shrem failed to report suspicious activity to regulators “with respect to numerous Bitcoin purchases” Faiella made from BitInstant.  The document contains email conversations between Shrem and BitInstant’s co-founder, who is not identified in the charges but is listed on BitInstant’s website as Gareth Nelson, in which Shrem tried to hide his dealings with Faiella by pretending to ban him from BitInstant’s exchange platform.  “You are hereby banned from our services,” he wrote in an email to BTCKing that he copied to Nelson.  According to the complaint, Shrem then privately wrote to BTCKing, without including Nelson. “Your email address is banned,” Shrem wrote, “but you can use a different one.”  Bitcoins have been gaining wider acceptance recently. The Sacramento Kings basketball team earlier this month became the first professional sports franchise to say it would allow purchases using bitcoins. Last month, ecommerce site Overstock.com announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency.  Created in 2009 by a developer or team of developers going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, the bitcoin’s earliest adopters have included people expressing a desire to conduct their affairs in a realm outside of government-sanctioned commercial spaces.  Some of that sentiment is visible in the charges against Shrem and Faiella. In one online interaction, Shrem tried to assure Faiella he was being discreet.  “The art of hiding is making people think you are someone else,” he wrote. Faiella replied: “You must understand that the people that we pay taxes to have a long reach and I like to stay away from that.”  Reporting by Emily Flitter in New York; Additional reporting by Nate Raymond in New York and Brett Wolf in St. Louis; Editing by Leslie Adler",-0.01976346153846153,0.007817356254856257
449,Bitcoin Foundation hit by resignations over new director,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4F02B20140516,"May 16, 2014 06:09pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the most prominent trade group pushing adoption of the electronic currency Bitcoin begins its annual conference on Friday, it is being roiled by controversy.  At least 10 members of the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation have resigned over last week’s election of onetime Disney child star and current Bitcoin entrepreneur and financier Brock Pierce as a new director, officials at the group said.  Some of the members cited Pierce’s troubled past. That includes allegations in lawsuits from three employees of Pierce’s first company, bankrupt web video business Digital Entertainment Network, that he provided drugs and pressured them for sex when they were minors.  Pierce has denied the accusations, which first surfaced in 2000.  “The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations,” Pierce told Reuters via email.  Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney’s “First Kid,” paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands.  While Bitcoin Foundation officials played down the defections, several members who resigned from the Foundation assailed its governance track record.  “The track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal,” said Patrick Alexander, a resigning Foundation member in a post on its discussion pages. “I no longer want to be associated with these people.” Attempts to reach him for additional comment were unsuccessful.  Though it is highly volatile, the value of the electronic currency in existence has skyrocketed into the billions of dollars as the number of businesses accepting it has increased and investors have sought to create new ways for it to be used.  More than 1,000 Bitcoin investors, business people and enthusiasts are expected to attend the conference in Amsterdam.  The programming effort that governs how Bitcoin works is led by Gavin Andresen, who is chief scientist at the Foundation and gets a salary from it. The Foundation also plays an important role for Bitcoin in lobbying on its behalf in various jurisdiction as authorities grapple with how to police the semi-anonymous currency.  Other members who resigned called on the board to more carefully vet future candidates as well as remove Pierce from the board.  Bitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck said that his group had more than 1,500 members and would bounce back from the latest controversy.  “Democracy is messy sometimes,” Murck said. “If in the future members decide they want to have a vetting process, that’s great.”  Some Bitcoin Foundation members say they weren’t aware of Pierce’s past until after the election, when others circulated media accounts concerning the allegations.  Pierce was voted in by the Foundation’s industry members, who pay higher dues, to fill one of two spots vacated by others who had resigned: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of the bankrupt top Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, and Charlie Shrem, who has been charged with conspiring to launder money for users of the shuttered Silk Road underground drug bazaar.  Pierce has made a splash in the insular Bitcoin world by backing more than a dozen startups, speaking frequently at conferences, and leading a bid to buy Mt. Gox for one Bitcoin, currently worth less than $500.  Bitcoin startups have attracted investment from some venture capital firms and from individuals through “crowdfunding,” in which many amateurs support projects, often with small investments and without the due diligence typically conducted by professional investors. Pierce has been a major beneficiary of the trend, garnering pledges of more than $700,000 for his investment syndicate on the crowdfunding site AngelList.  Cyan Banister, a startup CEO who made a nonbinding pledge of $5,000 to Pierce’s investing syndicate, after learning of the allegations said she would withdraw from his group.  Phil Sanderson, an IDG Ventures investor in San Francisco who follows Bitcoin, said that the currency’s growth was being hindered by the lack of effective public faces. “Bitcoin hasn’t really had a strong, vocal leader with a great background,” he said.

450,Bitcoin firms explore U.S. rules for derivative exchanges,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2I2CT20140319,"March 19, 2014 07:39pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies have inquired in the past month about regulations that would govern exchanges for bitcoin derivatives, a top U.S. regulator said on Wednesday, a sign such virtual currencies could become a more mainstream financial product.  Regulators have stepped up their efforts to rein in bitcoin after incidents such as the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.  The novelty of the technology has made it hard for regulators to categorize bitcoin, but trading derivatives such as futures or swaps would subject companies to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “Let me tell you, (if) they’ve got a derivatives contract, we have jurisdiction... and we should regulate it,” Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told Reuters in an interview.  In the past 30 days, a number of companies requested information to see what the rules were for setting up a market place to trade bitcoin derivatives, Chilton said.  “These are people that are inquiring about what they should do if they wanted to request (official) status,” he said.  He declined to name the companies, which have not officially filed any paperwork to get legal status, he said.  Chilton is set to leave the commission on Friday after more than six years with the regulator.  Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control, or any backing, by a government or a central bank - something its proponents like, but that also makes it vulnerable to mishaps.  New York state’s top financial services regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, has been the most vocal about regulating bitcoin, saying last week that he wants prospective virtual currency exchange operators to submit formal applications.  The CFTC, which regulates futures and swaps, is also studying whether it should regulate the new electronic currencies, its head said last week.

451,U.S. company plans funds that double bitcoin price moves,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1P01TL,"January 05, 2018 08:56pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are ramping up efforts to tap into the fever surrounding digital assets, and the latest planned bitcoin products could deliver some head-turning and stomach-churning price movements if they come to market.  The new idea is to build “leveraged” and “inverse” funds that would rise - or fall - twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day.  Direxion Asset Management LLC plans to list such products on Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s NYSE Arca exchange if U.S. securities regulators give the nod, according to a filing by the exchange this week.  In the filing, the exchange said the listing “will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.”      Bitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.  Bitcoin is one of the wildest trades in the market today, delivering sharp gains and losses that defy explanation. Trading has been expensive and difficult, with brokerages offering limited access and specialist websites like Coinbase reporting regular outages. Top voices on markets from economist Robert Shiller to JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon have warned people off buying bitcoin.  Yet asset managers have been racing to design more than 10 proposals for bitcoin funds that are currently before U.S. regulators.  New ETFs could make access to bitcoin easier and, in the case of the Direxion product, mean bigger stakes for investors, with a 25 percent gain or loss on one day doubled to 50 percent.   So far the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declined or put on hold all the proposals.  A spokesman representing Direxion declined to comment on the latest filing as did a representative from NYSE.  Bitcoin gained nearly 12 percent on Friday to $16,928 on the Bitstamp exchange.

452,Winklevoss twins use bitcoins to book space trip,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA241XQ20140305,"March 05, 2014 01:45pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - You can’t spend bitcoins at Amazon.com or to pay your mortgage but, as the Winklevoss twins showed on Wednesday, you can use the digital currency to book a trip into suborbital space.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who famously accused Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, said they used bitcoins to buy tickets for a high-altitude voyage on billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic commercial spaceflight venture.  The brothers, Olympic rowers who earned MBA degrees from Oxford University, have become bitcoin evangelists and investors and are planning to launch a fund to make it easy to trade the digital currency on the stock market.  In a blog post, Tyler Winklevoss compared Branson’s space endeavor and bitcoin entrepreneurs to major historical figures who changed the way the world was perceived, like Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama and Nicolaus Copernicus.  “It is in this vein that Cameron and I contemplate our tickets into space - as seed capital supporting a new technology that may forever change the way we travel, purchased with a new technology that may forever change the way we transact,” he wrote.  Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of Branson’s London-based Virgin Group, is selling rides on its SpaceShipTwo for $250,000.  The twins are not the first to sign up for Virgin Galactic using bitcoins, but it is the highest-profile flight booking to date using the currency. Last November, Branson announced that a flight attendant from Hawaii had become the first person to pay for a seat with bitcoins.  Bitcoin, a digital currency that is traded on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control, has seen its value soar in the past year as it gains attention from growing numbers of investors, entrepreneurs and regulators.  But the virtual currency’s struggle for legitimacy has been shaken by recent debacles, including the collapse last week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s dominant bitcoin exchange.  Few major retailers have begun accepting payment in bitcoins, and critics say the currency’s high volatility makes it unsuitable for everyday transactions.  The six-passenger, two-pilot SpaceShipTwo is hauled into the air by a twin-hull carrier jet and then released.  The upcoming flights are designed to reach altitudes of more than 65 miles above Earth, high enough to see the curvature of the planet set against the blackness of space.

453,"Regulatory fears hammer bitcoin below $10,000, half its peak",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F60CG,"January 17, 2018 04:55pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Bitcoin fell as much as 20 percent on Wednesday, piercing below $10,000, while other cryptocurrencies took similar spills due to investor fears that regulators could clamp down on them in an effort to curb speculation.  The world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency at one point lost 30 percent of its value since Tuesday. Bitcoin, despite some stabilization in late U.S. trading, was half its record peak of almost $20,000 set on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange a month ago.  Ethereum and Ripple, the No. 2 and No. 3 virtual currencies, tumbled after reports South Korea and China could ban cryptocurrency trading, sparking worries of a wider regulatory crackdown.  “There is a lot of panic in the market. People are selling to try and get the hell out of there,” said Charles Hayter, founder of Cryptocompare, which owns cryptocurrencies.   “You have more regulatory uncertainty ... and because of these falls, you have these other fallouts,” he said, referring to the collapse of some cryptocurrencies in the recent slump in prices.  Analysts at Citi said on Wednesday bitcoin could halve again in value amid the current rout, adding that a possible fall to a range between $5,605 and $5,673 “looks very likely to be very speedy”.  With South Korea, Japan and China all making noises about a regulatory swoop, and officials in France and the United States vowing to investigate cryptocurrencies, there are concerns that global coordination on how to regulate them will accelerate.  Officials are expected to debate the rise of bitcoin at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina in March.    “Cryptocurrencies could be capped in the current quarter ahead of the G20 meeting in March, where policymakers could discuss tighter regulations,” said Shuhei Fujise, chief analyst at Alt Design.  The current rout in bitcoin and other digital currencies was a far cry from their dramatic run-up in 2017 when mainstream investors jumped on the bandwagon and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital, token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand.  “Bitcoin is deciding whether this is the moment to crash and burn,” said Steven Englander, head of strategy at New York-based Rafiki Capital.  Bitcoin has plummeted before.   There have been nine instances including the current selloff going back to 2011 where bitcoin’s price was halved on the Bitstamp exchange. The last time was from November 2014 to January 2015.  On Wednesday, bitcoin fell as low as $9,222 on Bitstamp, its lowest price since Dec. 1, as CBOE and CME bitcoin futures tumbled to contract lows.  The latest market losses stemmed from reports that South Korea’s finance minister said banning trading in cryptocurrencies is still an option and that Seoul plans a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.  Separately, a senior Chinese central banker said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services.  “My conjecture is that cryptocurrency holders are trying to decide whether to abandon bitcoin because its limitations mean it will be superseded by better products or bet that it can thrive despite them,” Englander said.  While many observers say the recent falls show that the bubble has burst, those backing the nascent markets say that regulation is welcomed and wild price swings to be expected.  “The volatility of bitcoin - and other cryptocurrencies - is an expected, and important, part of the journey to becoming a mature asset class. We expect the volatility to continue throughout 2018 but fundamentally believe that bitcoin is still in a bull market,” said Christopher Keshian, co-founder of $APEX Token Fund.   Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 15 percent since Tuesday, according to website CoinMarketCap.  Ripple, the third-biggest, has lost 18 percent of its value over the past 24 hours and was quoted at $1.03, down from a high of $3.81 on Jan. 4.     “The run-up in bitcoin created a mystique of one-way trading which is being shaken, but the pricing requires faith that there will always be demand,” Englander wrote in a research note.  “This is far from guaranteed given the existence of alternatives with better characteristics.”     Graphic - A Rollercoaster Month for Bitcoin: reut.rs/2DHtz2Q  Reporting by Tommy Wilkes in London and Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo, Writing by Vidya Ranganathan and Tommy Wilkes; Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London and Richard Leong in New York; editing by Mark Heinrich and Nick Zieminski",-0.09551515151515151,0.013129254303496726
454,"CORRECTED-Stakes are high in hunt for bitcoin's ""messiah""",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N13Y27Q20151209,"December 09, 2015 11:01am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Adds full name of start-up in paragraph 13 and corrects date (to ‘last’ year from ‘this’ year) in paragraph 23)  By Jeremy Wagstaff  SINGAPORE, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The stakes are high in the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or people behind bitcoin, not just for the journalist who gets it right first, but also for the cryptocurrency itself.  An Australian entrepreneur and academic, Craig Steven Wright, is the latest candidate, outed in articles by Wired magazine and technology news website Gizmodo hours before his home and office in Sydney were searched by police.  Both articles said investigations based on leaked emails, documents and web archives pointed strongly to Wright being “Nakamoto”. “Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he’s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did,” said Wired.  But the search has already tripped up several journalists, most famously Newsweek’s Leah McGrath Goodman, who identified Japanese American Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto in March 2014 as bitcoin’s creator.  Dorian Nakamoto denied it - as has nearly everyone else alleged to be the mastermind credited with writing the paper, protocol and software in 2008 that gave rise to bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.  Unmasking the “real” Nakamoto would be significant both for the future development of bitcoin and, potentially, the currency’s market value.  While any changes to the bitcoin protocol can only be implemented by consensus, the proven founder of the cryptocurrency could hold considerable sway.  “Decision-making power doesn’t rest with any individual, but Nakamoto is such a mythical figure, if he appears he could become a sort of messiah to the community,” said Roberto Capodieci, a Singapore-based entrepreneur focusing on the blockchain.  Persuading that community is not easy: while the system is decentralised by design, a cluster of so-called bitcoin miners based in China are key, Antony Lewis, a Singapore-based bitcoin consultant, said.  Unlike traditional currency, bitcoins are not distributed by a central bank or backed by physical assets such as gold, but are “mined” using computers to calculate increasingly complex algorithmic formulas.  Miners run pools of computers that process transactions and create new bitcoins, an energy intensive business that has frozen out all but a handful of players.  The group effectively scuttled a recent effort by one key bitcoin thinker to make processing simpler and cheaper, Lewis said.  David Moskowitz, Singapore-based founder of start-up bitcoin brokerage Coin Republic, said knowing who Nakamoto was would be significant “because people are looking for a core voice behind (bitcoin). It would help us understand what Satoshi thought”.  Then there’s the fact that bitcoin researchers believe he or she may be holding up to 1 million bitcoins, which if sold today would fetch $414 million.  If Nakamoto chose to sell out, or even hinted that he might, that would push the price down, reducing the incentive to mine which might in turn provoke a steeper fall in the currency, Lewis said.  On the other hand, Nakamoto could help reduce uncertainty by reassuring bitcoin users he was not going to sell his holdings in one go or, more drastically, do something called “burning” - publicly deleting the coin by sending them to a bitcoin address to which he or she did not have the key.  “It would be like throwing the money into the bottom of the sea, and reduces the uncertainty of dumping onto the market,” said Lewis.  Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful.  Fellow tenants at the north Sydney office building listed as the address of one of his companies described him as “an outgoing guy”, who they nicknamed “Mr Bitcoin” because he had once offered to pay for some work in the currency.  And even if Wright did admit to being Nakamoto, he would still have to prove it.  That could be done by announcing he would move some of the bitcoin believed to belong to him, and then doing so, or signing a message with one of the encryption keys used in emails known to have been written by Nakamoto when bitcoin first appeared.  Wright has not been a prominent member of the bitcoin community, but he has appeared at several gatherings in the past year or two.  Moskowitz, who met him at a Singapore conference last year, said he was interesting and pleasant to talk to. “He’s clearly very intelligent and fits the profile,” he said. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean he is Nakamoto.”  Hints as to Wright’s own feelings on unmasking Nakamoto can be found on Quora, a website where users answer questions posed by other users and vote for the best answer.  In September someone with his name, position and profile picture “upvoted” another Quora user’s comment that “as a currency that is meant to be ‘for the people, by the people’, it is probably smart that no one knows who exactly started this coin. It is perfect that Satoshi Nakamoto founded it and vanished.”   (Reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff, with additional reporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; Editing by Alex Richardson)",0.15876206896551726,0.17283814126486538

Gox collapse  * Tax Office moves hit co’s tax credit recovery hopes  * “Mr. Bitcoin’s” whereabouts unknown  By Jane Wardell and Jeremy Wagstaff  SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australian Craig Steven Wright is the latest in a line of men alleged to be the mysterious creator of bitcoin, a digital currency that has attracted the interest of banks, speculators, criminals and regulators.  Wired magazine, which along with fellow U.S. publication Gizmodo published a story outing Wright based on a stash of leaked documents and emails, called him a genius.  But interviews with those who have done business with Wright, and a closer inspection of documents published by the two technology websites paint a more complex picture. They point to a smart but sometimes abrasive figure facing growing legal and financial problems at least in part caused by his involvement with bitcoin.  While it was not immediately possible to support or refute claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto - the person or group credited with writing the paper, protocols and software that led to bitcoin - some of those who worked with Wright raised questions about the timing of the leak and the likelihood that he was Nakamoto.  “It can’t be him, there’s no way he could have kept quiet about it this long,” said a former senior employee at Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence, who also detailed Wright’s difficulties with authorities over his Australian businesses’ bitcoin dealings.  The former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, citing legal issues, said the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in early 2014 had a direct effect on Hotwire, which is registered in Australia and is in the hands of administrators attempting to unravel disputes with the Australian Tax Office (ATO).  The collapse of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin coincided with a decision by the ATO, according to the documents, not to regard Wright’s bitcoin as money and that the digital currency therefore was taxable like any other commodity. This punctured Hotwire’s hopes it could recover more than A$3 million in tax credits and helped sink the company.  “Their cash flow disappeared right around the time Mt. Gox collapsed,” the former employee told Reuters, adding that staff at Hotwire were told that Wright had funds in a bitcoin trust, in which he was a beneficiary along with other unnamed parties.  “When they were trying to find cash flow after they were hit by Mt. Gox, they couldn’t sell the bitcoins in the trust to get the cashflow because they couldn’t break this wallet as there are other trustees.”  Wright has not commented publicly on the Wired and Gizmodo reports, and Reuters’ attempts to contact him using various listed email addresses were unsuccessful. Wright’s blog was taken down on Wednesday, his Twitter and Google+ accounts were deleted and access to his full LinkedIn profile restricted.  Attempts to reach Wright’s lawyer were unsuccessful and another former Hotwire employee said all staff had been instructed not to speak to the media.  Wright’s whereabouts are unknown. The landlord at his rented Sydney home told a Reuters reporter that Wright had been due to move out with his family before Christmas to move to London, where he recently attended a conference and was, according to his LinkedIn profile, enrolled for a Master’s degree at University of London.  The ATO was behind raids by Australian police on Wednesday on Wright’s home and office in Sydney. It declined to provide any further detail on the raids, citing legal confidentiality.  Administrator McGrath Nicol told creditors last month that the ATO slapped a A$1.7 million fine on Hotwire over its tax refund claims. The former Hotwire employee said Wright once paid in bitcoin to buy a banking platform from a Middle Eastern seller. He then sought to claim a goods and services tax return, or import credit, in cash worth millions of dollars which the ATO denied.  Bitcoin experts say that unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto would be significant for the industry. Not only would the proven founder likely hold some sway over the future of the bitcoin protocol, but Nakamoto may also hold enough bitcoin to influence the price of bitcoin.  “What people are looking for essentially is the Bill Gates of bitcoin,” said David Glance, a director of innovation at the University of Western Australia and noted bitcoin expert, who doubts that Wright is Nakamato, pointing to pro-capitalist, anti-hacking columns Wright wrote for The Conversation, a local publication, in 2011.  After ditching several directorships in July, Wright remains a director of three companies, including Hotwire, which had sought to launch the world’s first bitcoin bank.  McGrath Nicol noted in one report that the merging of bitcoin and cash transactions in the web of companies involving Wright “has made our review more difficult.”  Wright’s attempt to go offline in recent days contrasts with the outgoing, self-promoting figure painted by former employees, neighbouring businesses at his Sydney offices and other acquaintances.  His Youtube account, now also deleted, contained videos of him rowing in the gym attempting to break records, while his LinkedIn profile contained a long list of academic qualifications.  Asked about a statement on that profile that Wright was “engaged as digital forensic expert and trainer with the Australian Federal Police”, the AFP said Wright was engaged to provide a technical report to support an investigation.  “He was really outgoing, we used to call him Mr. Bitcoin,” said an employee of a neighbouring business while Wright’s offices were searched.

National authorities across the globe, and particularly in Asia, have attempted to put the brakes on a global boom in the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - a form of digital money created and maintained by its users.  But Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of Germany’s Bundesbank, said national rules may struggle to contain a global phenomenon.  “Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,” Wuermeling told an event in Frankfurt.   Chinese regulators have banned initial coin offerings, shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining - but activity has continued through alternative channels in China despite the crackdown.  South Korea, where speculation on cryptocurrencies is also rife, is working on plans to ban virtual coin exchanges.

Jennifer Shasky-Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said her unit hosted a presentation by members of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group of Bitcoin-related businesses.  “This is part of our ongoing dialogue aimed at enhancing communication with our regulated financial industries,” Shasky-Calvery said in a statement.  She also noted that virtual currency exchanges must register with regulators and face requirements similar to those imposed on other financial firms. FinCEN is the Treasury Department’s anti-money laundering unit.  Bitcoins, which have been around since 2008, are a form of electronic money that can be exchanged without using traditional banking or money transfer systems.  Bitcoins are the most prominent of these new currencies, which have come under scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement officials.  Representatives of the Bitcoin Foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The group’s website says it aims to make the currency more respected and to improve and protect its integrity.  The currency first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to the Silk Road online marketplace where marijuana, heroin, LSD and other illicit drugs are sold.  In recent months, the U.S. government has taken steps to rein in the currency and more regulatory action is expected.  Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchanger of U.S. dollars with Bitcoins, had two accounts held by its U.S. subsidiary seized this year by agents from the Department of Homeland Security on the grounds that it was operating a money transmitting business without a license.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported last year that Bitcoin was used by criminals to move money around the world, and the U.S. Treasury said in March that digital currency firms are money transmitters and must comply with rules that combat money laundering.

458,Chinese bitcoin exchanges resume withdrawals after freeze,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18S42X,"June 01, 2017 05:18am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Major Chinese bitcoin exchanges have started to resume allowing withdrawals of the cryptocurrency after nearly a four-month freeze that followed increased scrutiny from the central bank.  Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTCChina, said in a statement on Thursday that his exchange had started “testing” withdrawals after upgrading its “know your customer” and anti-money laundering systems.  Huobi, another exchange, said in a statement it would resume withdrawals on Thursday.  Two industry sources said OkCoin, China’s third major cryptocurrency exchange, had resumed allowing withdrawals. A spokeswoman for OkCoin declined to comment but referred Reuters to an industry news outlet that reported on the resumption.  As the popularity of bitcoin spread, China quickly evolved into the world’s leading venue for bitcoin trading. But volumes collapsed after the People’s Bank of China began looking into the market more closely and conducting checks of the exchanges at the start of this year.  Major exchanges halted withdrawals of bitcoins in early February, introduced trading fees and stepped up scrutiny of clients amid discussions with authorities.  While withdrawals were suspended, investors could buy and sell bitcoins on Chinese exchanges but were barred from transferring them or downloading and removing them.  One of the industry sources said the decision to resume withdrawals was made after the central bank had signaled that it was not forbidden. BTCChina and OkCoin were allowing customers to withdraw a maximum of 10 bitcoins a day, the source said.  It remained unclear when more formal regulation of the industry would begin, the person added.  The decision to resume withdrawals comes with the price of bitcoin near an all-time high. Prices on European exchange Bitstamp were around $2,400 on Thursday - up nearly 150 percent from the start of the year.  The intensified regulator interest in bitcoin coincided with a clampdown on capital outflows, as authorities sought to relieve downward pressure on the yuan currency and stop the depletion of China’s foreign exchange reserves.  Bitcoin’s relative anonymity prompted some industry observers to say it had become an attractive, if niche, option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals could buy each year.  The yuan has stymied forecasts it would continue to fall after losing about 6.5 percent against the dollar last year. It is up more than 2 percent since the start of the year.

459,"As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1IN01X,"May 21, 2018 08:36pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.  Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?   Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.   “Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources.  Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.  The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.  The Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.  But the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.   Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.  Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.  “Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.  The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]  Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.   To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.   “Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.  Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.  However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.   Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.   Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.  Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval.  Visiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports.   Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal.   Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.   A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.  Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.  “Its not your everyday investment world,” said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.   HIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.      “We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,” Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE’s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.  Other companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan’s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.   “The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,” said Kenetic’s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan’s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.  People involved in Canaan’s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.   While soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan’s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.  In Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.

National authorities across the globe, and particularly in Asia, have attempted to put the brakes on a global boom in the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - a form of digital money created and maintained by its users.  But Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of Germany’s Bundesbank, said national rules may struggle to contain a global phenomenon.  “Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,” Wuermeling told an event in Frankfurt.   Chinese regulators have banned initial coin offerings, shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining - but activity has continued through alternative channels in China despite the crackdown.  South Korea, where speculation on cryptocurrencies is also rife, is working on plans to ban virtual coin exchanges.

463,Mt Gox: The brief reign of bitcoin's top exchange,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1R06C20140228,"February 28, 2014 11:14am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - The collapse of Mt. Gox might appear sudden, but bitcoin insiders say its downfall began nearly a year ago as the virtual currency exchange tangled with regulators, split from former business partners and grappled with cyber attacks.  Mt. Gox’s fall lays bare the difficulties the bitcoin community faces as it tries to square its freewheeling, libertarian ideals with the rigorous regulation required in financial services and customers’ needs for reliable service.  Once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox on Friday filed for bankruptcy protection, saying it may have lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of the virtual coins due to hacking into its faulty computer system. How it managed to lose so much so quickly is still unclear.  U.S. federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Tokyo-based Mt. Gox - and other bitcoin businesses - to seek information on a recent spate of disruptive cyber attacks that overwhelmed some exchanges and forced them to suspend withdrawals. Mt. Gox never recovered, whereas rivals such as Slovenia-based Bitstamp have since resumed operations.  “The first wave of entrepreneurs were evangelists for the technology, but low on quality,” said Nick Shalek, an investor at Ribbit Capital, which has backed bitcoin companies including digital-wallet Coinbase. Now, he said, a more serious group of entrepreneurs is trying to build more serious infrastructure around bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that, unlike conventional money, is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value has soared in the last year, and the total worth of bit coins minted is now about $7 billion.  Mt. Gox’s decline, ironically, started just as bitcoin was hitting a new level of notoriety in the broader public. Proponents include prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists who talked up a virtual currency system free of government intervention or control.  Founded in 2009 by American software hacker Jed McCaleb, Mt. Gox was originally a site for people to trade cards for a game called “Magic: The Gathering.” (Mt. Gox is short for “Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange”)  McCaleb turned the site into a bitcoin exchange and sold the fledgling business in 2011 to Mark Karpeles. Under the Frenchman, Mt. Gox became the face of bitcoin - where investors regularly checked the price of the digital currency and where the largest volume of trades occurred.  As regulators started to take notice of the bitcoin market, Karpeles became a vocal champion. He described Mt. Gox as “the main exchange” and argued for bitcoin’s legitimacy while trying to distance it from criminals using the digital currency for money laundering or drug-related activities.  Karpeles said Mt. Gox had no interest in helping criminals launder funds, and pushed back against claims that bitcoin transactions were completely anonymous, noting that while the system was designed for privacy, it was easy to track bitcoin across the network.  If authorities found a way to shut down Mt. Gox, “the likely result will be more exchanges popping up all over, with methods much harder to track, and who will be much less likely to agree to help with any investigation,” Karpeles said in a 2011 email to a reporter for the Compliance Complete service of Thomson Reuters Accelus.  “We want (authorities) to understand that the problem is not bitcoin itself, but what some people do with those,” he said in the message, one of numerous emailed exchanges over the years.  In 2011, bitcoin was barely trading at $1, but volumes were picking up at Mt. Gox, which routinely saw more than 20,000 transactions daily, more than double those in late 2010.  Karpeles said Mt. Gox had servers in the United States but little in the way of money. It used Iowa-based online payment processor Dwolla Inc to make U.S. customer transactions easier.  Bitcoin’s popularity increased incrementally, similar to its price. On April 1, 2013, it topped $100 for the first time, and trading volumes were increasing.  Around this time, a regulatory push intensified. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) declared bitcoin exchanges to be money transmitters, requiring them to register, enact formal anti-money laundering programs, and report suspicious activity.  Shortly after that, a bitcoin exchange known as bitfloor was shuttered after its U.S. bank account was closed because it had not properly registered with regulators.  Concerns that regulatory action would cause customer funds to be trapped resulted in a sharp plunge in bitcoin, falling from $230 on April 10 to a low of $68.49 on April 17 - a period of time that turned out to be the peak in terms of dollar-denominated trading on Mt. Gox, according to Bitcoincharts.  As volumes jumped that month - on two separate days, there were more than 500,000 dollar-denominated transactions on Mt. Gox - the exchange said it was overwhelmed by the volumes, and it was working to upgrade its systems.  Karpeles said in an April 13 email that bitfloor’s closure was a fate that would not befall Mt. Gox. “We apply very strict AML (anti-money laundering) procedures to avoid exactly this kind of issue. We have very good relationships with our banking partners and making sure everything is run as good as possible.”  On April 18, Karpeles clarified that Dwolla was the company’s only transaction provider. “We do not use any U.S. bank,” he said via email.  Mt. Gox did not immediately register with FinCEN - a misstep that would in part lead to its demise.  In May 2013, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security froze an account that Dwolla held at Veridian Credit Union in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in Delaware.  A related court document said another account at Wells Fargo had been seized earlier that month. The Department of Homeland Security justified the seizures by accusing Mt. Gox of failing to register with Treasury as demanded by FinCEN. (It eventually registered in June.)  Karpeles has declined to comment on the seizures, but this complicated the ability of Mt. Gox to allow U.S. customers to liquidate existing investments. Dwolla eventually ended its relationship with Mt. Gox, in a blow to the exchange.  “Most professional users moved away from Mt. Gox months ago, leaving April 2013 or thereabouts. By June 2013, the final nail was in the coffin for U.S. users,” said one of bitcoin’s core developers, who requested anonymity.  This in turn caused bitcoin’s prices on Mt. Gox to surge.  “What happened then is because you couldn’t withdraw dollars, there became a major premium for bitcoin on Mt. Gox,” said Jacob Dienelt, a maker of bitcoin paper wallets in New York.  The rise in bitcoin’s value gave it more cachet with the general public, even though most people were still uninformed about exactly what bitcoin was.  Dollar trading volumes started to diminish on Mt. Gox then - from about 66,770 transactions daily in May to a little over 14,000 in September. Volumes surged for a few months, but dropped to about 9,000 daily by January, according to bitcoincharts.  Those in the industry said Mt. Gox ceased to be the exchange of choice about nine months ago as competitors such as Bitstamp gained prominence. By the start of this year, Mt. Gox was considered a diminished player due to concerns about its technology and safety.  “It was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going on,” said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer based in Switzerland.  Mt. Gox’s problems earlier this month stemmed from “distributed denial of service” attacks, where hackers sent thousands of phantom transactions to the exchange to slow its operations. Other exchanges experienced this problem as well, but were able to restore service more quickly.  The hackers exploited a process used by some bitcoin exchanges that introduced “malleability” into the code governing transactions, experts said. Simply put, this allowed hackers to slightly alter the details of codes to create thousands of copies of transactions. These copies slowed the exchanges to a crawl, forcing them to independently verify each transaction to determine what was real and what was fake.  “It was a well-known issue that every major exchange in the bitcoin community knew about and had solutions for. Mt. Gox did not,” said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Robocoin, the world’s first bitcoin ATM maker.  Mt. Gox said on Friday that it had lost 750,000 of its users’ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. At the current bitcoin price of about $565, that would total some $480 million - representing about 7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins.  “There could be issues with security, with theft and so on, and there could be issues with the way things were implemented, where there’s just some negligence and just some accidents and poor management of the exchange,” said Moshe Cohen, assistant professor at Columbia Business School in New York.  Mt. Gox said there was a discrepancy of 2.8 billion yen ($27.4 million) in its bank accounts when it checked on Monday.  It had 127,000 creditors in bankruptcy, just over 1,000 of whom are Japanese.  “First of all, I’m very sorry,” Karpeles, wearing a suit instead of his customary T-shirt, told a news conference in Tokyo on Friday. “The bitcoin industry is healthy and it is growing. It will continue, and reducing the impact is the most important point.”  Reporting by Brett Wolf of the Compliance Complete service of Thomson Reuters Accelus in St. Louis and Emily Flitter in New York; Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Sarah McBride in San Francisco; Writing by David Gaffen; Editing by Tiffany Wu",0.012740566037735851,0.044356278417599176

The new idea is to build “leveraged” and “inverse” funds that would rise - or fall - twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day.  Direxion Asset Management LLC plans to list such products on Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s NYSE Arca exchange if U.S. securities regulators give the nod, according to a filing by the exchange this week.  In the filing, the exchange said the listing “will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.”      Bitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.  Bitcoin is one of the wildest trades in the market today, delivering sharp gains and losses that defy explanation. Trading has been expensive and difficult, with brokerages offering limited access and specialist websites like Coinbase reporting regular outages. Top voices on markets from economist Robert Shiller to JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon have warned people off buying bitcoin.  Yet asset managers have been racing to design more than 10 proposals for bitcoin funds that are currently before U.S. regulators.  New ETFs could make access to bitcoin easier and, in the case of the Direxion product, mean bigger stakes for investors, with a 25 percent gain or loss on one day doubled to 50 percent.   So far the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declined or put on hold all the proposals.  A spokesman representing Direxion declined to comment on the latest filing as did a representative from NYSE.  Bitcoin gained nearly 12 percent on Friday to $16,928 on the Bitstamp exchange.

Funds coming to market on Wednesday will purchase shares of companies, such as Hitachi Ltd, Accenture plc and Overstock.com Inc, that may benefit from the digital asset’s underlying technology.  Rather than buying wild-trading “cryptocurrencies” themselves, the funds’ tactic has mollified uneasy regulators who have denied or tabled more than a dozen proposals for funds that would own bitcoin or futures based on them.  Amplify Investments LLC and Reality Shares Inc are each launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in companies betting on blockchain, the decentralized technology bitcoin uses to keep a running record of transactions.  Companies from JPMorgan Chase & Co to Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp said blockchain can help them streamline processes, such as settling financial transactions.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) insisted the ETFs not include the word blockchain in their names if the stocks they hold do not directly collect a significant portion of their revenue from the technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News first reported the SEC’s discussions with companies over their funds’ proposed names.  But the funds - Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF and Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF - will nonetheless trade with the tickers BLOK and BLCN.  Bitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the asset.  Bitcoin last fell 15.5 percent to $11,500 on the Bitstamp exchange following reports suggesting South Korea could ban trading in cryptocurrencies.  The Reality Shares fund’s backers have said that buying companies that use blockchain to cut costs or start new business lines is a more conservative approach to investing than buying bitcoin directly because those companies are dependent on more factors than just that technology succeeding.  Eastman Kodak Co shares more than doubled last week after the one-time photography leader said it would launch a cryptocurrency called KODAKCoin.  Soft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea’s shares have doubled since that company shifted its focus to blockchain and changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp.

467,Bitcoin Foundation hit by resignations over new director,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4F02B20140516,"May 16, 2014 06:09pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the most prominent trade group pushing adoption of the electronic currency Bitcoin begins its annual conference on Friday, it is being roiled by controversy.  At least 10 members of the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation have resigned over last week’s election of onetime Disney child star and current Bitcoin entrepreneur and financier Brock Pierce as a new director, officials at the group said.  Some of the members cited Pierce’s troubled past. That includes allegations in lawsuits from three employees of Pierce’s first company, bankrupt web video business Digital Entertainment Network, that he provided drugs and pressured them for sex when they were minors.  Pierce has denied the accusations, which first surfaced in 2000.  “The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations,” Pierce told Reuters via email.  Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney’s “First Kid,” paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands.  While Bitcoin Foundation officials played down the defections, several members who resigned from the Foundation assailed its governance track record.  “The track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal,” said Patrick Alexander, a resigning Foundation member in a post on its discussion pages. “I no longer want to be associated with these people.” Attempts to reach him for additional comment were unsuccessful.  Though it is highly volatile, the value of the electronic currency in existence has skyrocketed into the billions of dollars as the number of businesses accepting it has increased and investors have sought to create new ways for it to be used.  More than 1,000 Bitcoin investors, business people and enthusiasts are expected to attend the conference in Amsterdam.  The programming effort that governs how Bitcoin works is led by Gavin Andresen, who is chief scientist at the Foundation and gets a salary from it. The Foundation also plays an important role for Bitcoin in lobbying on its behalf in various jurisdiction as authorities grapple with how to police the semi-anonymous currency.  Other members who resigned called on the board to more carefully vet future candidates as well as remove Pierce from the board.  Bitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck said that his group had more than 1,500 members and would bounce back from the latest controversy.  “Democracy is messy sometimes,” Murck said. “If in the future members decide they want to have a vetting process, that’s great.”  Some Bitcoin Foundation members say they weren’t aware of Pierce’s past until after the election, when others circulated media accounts concerning the allegations.  Pierce was voted in by the Foundation’s industry members, who pay higher dues, to fill one of two spots vacated by others who had resigned: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of the bankrupt top Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, and Charlie Shrem, who has been charged with conspiring to launder money for users of the shuttered Silk Road underground drug bazaar.  Pierce has made a splash in the insular Bitcoin world by backing more than a dozen startups, speaking frequently at conferences, and leading a bid to buy Mt. Gox for one Bitcoin, currently worth less than $500.  Bitcoin startups have attracted investment from some venture capital firms and from individuals through “crowdfunding,” in which many amateurs support projects, often with small investments and without the due diligence typically conducted by professional investors. Pierce has been a major beneficiary of the trend, garnering pledges of more than $700,000 for his investment syndicate on the crowdfunding site AngelList.  Cyan Banister, a startup CEO who made a nonbinding pledge of $5,000 to Pierce’s investing syndicate, after learning of the allegations said she would withdraw from his group.  Phil Sanderson, an IDG Ventures investor in San Francisco who follows Bitcoin, said that the currency’s growth was being hindered by the lack of effective public faces. “Bitcoin hasn’t really had a strong, vocal leader with a great background,” he said.

468,Prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur charged with money laundering,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0Q15N20140128,"January 27, 2014 07:31pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road.  Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin’s biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said on Monday.  Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1 million bond.  “At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent,” his lawyer Keith Miller said.  The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer. According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired with a Florida resident, Robert Faiella, who ran an illegal exchange, to sell more than $1 million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which was shuttered by authorities last year.  Faiella, 52, is also charged in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was arrested at his home in Coral Gables, Florida. At his court hearing on Monday in federal court in Florida, Faiella consented to detention until Wednesday, at which point there will be a bail hearing.  Shrem could not be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Faiella’s house and declined to be identified said, “Nobody wants to talk.”  Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital “wallets.”  The criminal complaint says that Shrem, in addition to knowing that Faiella’s business was funneling money into Silk Road, also used Silk Road himself to buy drugs, including marijuana-infused brownies.  “When Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,” Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement emailed to the press on Monday. “We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”  Bharara has said recently that prosecutors are not going after Bitcoin itself and view it as they view any other currency in which transactions are sometimes made illegally.  U.S. law enforcement officials have vowed to pursue any criminal activity in the nascent Bitcoin world as regulators try to formulate their approach to the digital currency.  The charging of a prominent Bitcoin Foundation official may be a blow to Bitcoin’s prospects, though it did not have a huge immediate impact on trading. Bitcoins were exchanging hands at $970 late on Monday, down from prices above $1,000 earlier this month but up from around $150 four months ago on the Tokyo-based exchange MtGox.  Winklevoss Capital, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, invested in BitInstant in 2012 and led a capital-raising effort last May that raised $1.5 million. The twins, who are best known for their failed lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in which they had claimed he had stolen their idea for an online social networking platform at Harvard, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.  “When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,” the Winkelvoss twins said in a statement. “Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest,” they said. “We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.”  As part of the conditions of his bail, Shrem will be confined to his parents’ home in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. A report prepared by the court for his bail hearing listed his net worth at $6 million, according to U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. Serrin Turner, an assistant U.S. attorney, opposed bail, saying Shrem had a “strong incentive to flee” and the means to do so.  Bitcoin insiders said Shrem’s arrest showed just how hard it is to get away with illegal activity using Bitcoin, which has an ownership chain built into its software so that each unit can be tied to the users who have acquired or spent it.  “Using bitcoin for illicit transactions is really, really dumb,” said Patrick Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation’s general counsel. “Bitcoins are so easy to track.”  According to the charges, Faiella, going by “BTCKing” online, sold bitcoins to Silk Road users and passed on purchase orders he received from the site to Shrem, who filled them, transferring funds to Faiella’s account at an unidentified bitcoin exchange service based in Japan.  The charging document says that Shrem failed to report suspicious activity to regulators “with respect to numerous Bitcoin purchases” Faiella made from BitInstant.  The document contains email conversations between Shrem and BitInstant’s co-founder, who is not identified in the charges but is listed on BitInstant’s website as Gareth Nelson, in which Shrem tried to hide his dealings with Faiella by pretending to ban him from BitInstant’s exchange platform.  “You are hereby banned from our services,” he wrote in an email to BTCKing that he copied to Nelson.  According to the complaint, Shrem then privately wrote to BTCKing, without including Nelson. “Your email address is banned,” Shrem wrote, “but you can use a different one.”  Bitcoins have been gaining wider acceptance recently. The Sacramento Kings basketball team earlier this month became the first professional sports franchise to say it would allow purchases using bitcoins. Last month, ecommerce site Overstock.com announced its plan to become the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency.  Created in 2009 by a developer or team of developers going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, the bitcoin’s earliest adopters have included people expressing a desire to conduct their affairs in a realm outside of government-sanctioned commercial spaces.  Some of that sentiment is visible in the charges against Shrem and Faiella. In one online interaction, Shrem tried to assure Faiella he was being discreet.  “The art of hiding is making people think you are someone else,” he wrote.

469,Prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur charged with money laundering,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0Q15N20140127,"January 27, 2014 06:39pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road.  Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin’s biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said on Monday.  Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1 million bond.  “At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent,” his lawyer Keith Miller said.  The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer.

470,Japan says any bitcoin regulation should be international,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1Q1YK20140227,"February 27, 2014 06:50pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Any regulation of the bitcoin crypto-currency should involve international cooperation to avoid loopholes, Japanese vice finance minister Jiro Aichi said on Thursday.  Commenting on the closure this week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest exchange for the bitcoin virtual currency, Aichi said the ministry would respond to the problems “if necessary”, after finding out exactly what happened.  “It’s not just the Ministry of Finance; many other agencies are related,” Aichi told a news conference. “As for its legal position, a currency (under Japan’s jurisdiction) would be coins or notes issued by the Bank of Japan. At the very least, we can say bitcoin is not a currency.”  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, appearing on Thursday before a Senate committee, said the Fed has no jurisdiction over bitcoin but that Congress should consider ways to regulate such virtual currencies.  The Mt. Gox website and Twitter feed went blank on Tuesday after weeks of turmoil. It suspended withdrawals on February 7 following a series of cyber attacks, leaving customers unable to recover their funds.  A document circulating on the internet saying that more than 744,000 bitcoins - worth around $423 million at current rates - were missing from Mt. Gox was created by a Tokyo-based consulting firm, said Ryan Selkis, a blogger who initially leaked scans of the document. Selkis, who uses the handle “twobitidiot”, said in an email that the “Crisis Strategy Draft” had been written by consulting firm Mandalah in meetings with Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.  A director at Mandalah told Reuters the firm had never been contracted by Mt. Gox to do “strategic planning” but declined to comment further.  On Wednesday, Karpeles had sought to assure investors that he was working with others to solve the problems. “As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt. Gox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues,” he said in a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website.  While proponents of bitcoin hail its anonymity and lack of ties to traditional banking, regulators have become increasingly interested in the digital currency due to its volatility and usage by criminal elements.  Bitcoins are created, or “mined”, in a process using a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made. At current prices, the bitcoin market is worth about $7 billion.  The document leaked this week by Selkis - who says he sold all his bitcoins - said 744,408 bitcoins, or about 6 percent of the 12.4 million bitcoins in circulation, were “missing” due to thefts that exploited “malleability” in the code governing transactions, which the Bitcoin Foundation and others have blamed on Mt. Gox’s customized software.  “Mt. Gox has been broken and it was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going,” said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer in Switzerland.  The leaked crisis plan proposed that Mt. Gox reduce its liabilities, switch off the exchange for a month while bringing in transition advisers, and reset all social network channels while rebranding under a different CEO.  Karpeles told Reuters in April 2013 that Mt. Gox was seeing daily inflows of $5-$20 million. He told Forbes his company hadn’t been able to keep up with all the changes as it became the largest exchange in the world.  The crisis plan said Mt. Gox had liabilities of $174 million, based on an assumed exchange rate of $160 per bitcoin - well below the $550 or so offered for bitcoins at other exchanges on Thursday - against assets of $32 million. A financial statement included in that document said Mt. Gox was expected to make $2 million in net income in the year to end-March, a sevenfold increase on the previous year.  It also said Mt. Gox turned a profit in its second year of existence, banking $286,000 in net income. Those figures match a 2013 report by credit research firm Tokyo Shoko Research, which was reviewed by Reuters. It said Mt. Gox “had a strong start”.  Mt. Gox had 600,000 customers at the time, the research report said - 30 percent from the United States, 10 percent from Britain and just 300 in Japan. Given that most users are overseas, any court case to retrieve missing funds would be more likely in the United States than Japan, said Ken Kiyohara, a lawyer at Jones Day. “It probably comes under the (Japanese) Financial Services Agency’s (FSA) remit, but giving a reason for that in one sentence is impossible,” he said.  Officials at the FSA and Finance Ministry each told Reuters bitcoin does not fall within their purview, while the Bank of Japan says only that it is studying the bitcoin phenomenon, which Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has called “interesting.”  People who had bitcoins at Mt. Gox are more definitive.  “It was the only place you could buy bitcoin directly with yen, so it hurts that it’s gone,” said Ryoichi Taga, a fellow at the Japan Digital Money Association.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has sent subpoenas to Mt. Gox, other bitcoin exchanges and businesses that deal in bitcoins to seek information on how they handled recent cyber attacks, a source familiar with the probe said. A spokesman for Bharara declined to comment.  Mt. Gox is under investigation by the U.S. federal law enforcement, according to a second source familiar with the case, while a third said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the situation.  The federal probe was spurred by information provided by the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency, Bloomberg reported. The foundation could not be reached immediately for comment. Karpeles, a founding member of the foundation, resigned from its board on Monday.  In Singapore on Thursday, Tembusu Terminals set up what it said was the city-state’s first automated tele-exchange machine (ATM) for buying bitcoins - at the downtown Spiffy Dapper bar - a week after the finance minister said bitcoins weren’t regulated by the ministry or the central bank.  Karpeles’ whereabouts in Japan were still unclear. The main Mt. Gox office remained deserted on Thursday, with bubble wrap inside the windows. The company said last week it was moving back to a previous office for “security reasons”. The company’s cubicle in the other office in Tokyo’s Shibuya area was inaccessible.  A concierge at Karpeles’ home - an upscale apartment near Shibuya - appeared to speak to someone on the intercom before saying there was nobody home.

The auction will kick off later on Wednesday initially for the U.S. dollar/bitcoin currency pair, Gemini said, and will eventually open the mechanism to all other digital currency pairs in the coming weeks.  Daily auctions are a common occurrence at traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, enhancing price transparency and discovery.  The auction’s launch on the Gemini exchange represents one of multiple efforts by market players to push trading of bitcoin and other digital currencies into the mainstream investing world.  “If you were building a securities exchange today, an auction would be a core feature,” said Tyler Winklevoss, chief executive officer at Gemini in New York.  “We’ve built this trading mechanism to further Gemini’s mission of building a next-generation exchange that advances the future of bitcoin trading.”  Gemini said in its blog that the exchange will at 5:00 pm EDT  begin accepting two-sided bids for the dollar/bitcoin pair for the next day’s auction ending at 4 pm. All eligible orders will be then filled at the final auction price.  In addition, auction trades receive fee discounts and are eligible for up to a 0.15 percent rebate, as opposed to over-the-counter trades that can cost upwards of 1-2 percent per trade.

Singapore is San-Francisco-based Coinbase’s first foray into Asia, said Brian Armstrong, the company’s chief executive officer and co-founder.  The money transfer service in Singapore, to be launched on Thursday, will allow consumers to buy and sell bitcoin with Singapore dollars. Armstrong said the service is not considered regulated activity in Singapore.  Unlike conventional currencies, bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank, and its value fluctuates according to demand by users.  On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $229.35, up 0.6 percent on the day.  Coinbase also launched a retail buy and sell service for consumers as well as an exchange for professional traders in Canada earlier this week.  “About a year ago, we made a decision to offer bitcoin services to as many countries in the world,” Armstrong told Reuters.  At present, Coinbase operates in 28 countries. Armstrong said the goal is to be in 40 countries by the end of 2015. “That would be an aggressive goal. So we may end up 2015 with 30-40 countries.”  Coinbase currently has more than 3.9 million consumer wallets, 40,000 merchants using its payment mechanism and 7,000 software developers using its platform to create new products.

Paul was in his home state of Kentucky on Tuesday to launch his 2016 White House bid. His campaign website, Stand With Rand, went live to coincide with the launch.  The website’s donation page reminds individuals that they are allowed to contribute up to $2,700 per election cycle and gives them the option of using a credit card, the online service PayPal or bitcoin.  The move to allow bitcoin donations reflects the Kentucky senator’s tendency to embrace new technology, his courting of Silicon Valley donors and outreach to younger voters, which would be a core constituency of a successful Paul campaign.  “Our campaign will be the most technologically savvy campaign. We’ll engage across all platforms, from Snapchat to bitcoin,” Paul spokesman Sergio Gor said in an email.  Paul, a libertarian, supports a flat income tax, cutting government spending to balance the budget, lessening the authority of the Federal Reserve and preserving personal liberties.  His campaign slogan is: “Defeat the Washington Machine.”  Bitcoin users favor the digital currency due to low transaction costs and instantaneous transfer. The U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a decentralized, virtual currency. Britain announced last month that it would begin regulating digital currencies such as bitcoin for the first time.

477,Bitcoin goes mainstream with ATM in Vancouver coffee shop,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE99S1EH20131029,"October 29, 2013 07:12pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A silver and blue ATM, perched up next to the espresso bar in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop, could launch a new era for the digital currency bitcoin, offering an almost instant way to exchange the world’s leading virtual money for cash.  The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise.  The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins.  “It’s as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin,” said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. “With this, it’s a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it’s at least two days.”  Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is.  With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.  Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the United States, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators.  “We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we’re excited to be here,” said Kelley. “By the end 2013, we’ll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we’ll be all over the world, including the United States.”  Bitcoin is not a recognized currency in Canada, so Ottawa’s anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.  Still Bitcoiniacs’ founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them.  “We’re already being proactive in our business,” said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. “We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the ‘know you customer’ laws and anti-money laundering laws.”  Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system’s control over the minting of money.  Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.  The currency’s reputation took a hit this month, when U.S. regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6 million in bitcoins.  But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.  “I think it’s definitely going mainstream,” said Demeter. “I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.”  In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers.  At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency.  “It’s been said that we’re at the stage where email was in 1992,” he said. “Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the Internet and email changed the world.”  Additional reporting by Louise Egan in Ottawa; Editing by Richard Chang",0.15370666666666669,0.05353998316498317
478,U.S. Treasury cautions Bitcoin businesses on legal duties,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0JW1YP20131217,"December 17, 2013 05:25pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"ST. LOUIS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department’s anti money-laundering unit is warning businesses linked to the digital currency Bitcoin that they may have to comply with federal law and regulation as money transmitters, a Treasury spokesman said.  Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has sent “industry outreach” letters to about a dozen firms, regarding potential anti-money laundering compliance obligations related to Bitcoin businesses, FinCEN spokesman Steve Hudak told Thomson Reuters’ regulatory information service Compliance Complete.  Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system. It has also raised concerns among law-enforcement authorities that digital currencies could be used for laundering money.  The letters have had a “chilling effect” on Bitcoin businesses, which are intimidated by the threat of civil and criminal sanctions for non-compliance, said Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group. The firms, he said, may effectively be “put out of business in an extrajudicial manner.”  Brad Jacobsen, a lawyer representing one Bitcoin businessman who received a letter from FinCEN, said his client has chosen to suspend his business activity “while state and federal compliance matters are considered and/or appropriate exemptions are determined.”  FinCEN’s letters, which ask recipients for more information about their business models, put the firms on notice that there is a legal “gray area,” so they are “better off to err on the side of caution” and comply with FinCEN’s rules, Matonis said.  Certain Bitcoin businesses came under FinCEN regulation in March when the Treasury bureau issued guidance defining some players in the digital currency industry as money transmitters.  For more than a decade the money-transmission industry, which includes firms such as Western Union and PayPal, has been required to enact anti-money laundering controls, report suspicious activity, register with FinCEN and obtain state licenses.  These steps are required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the main anti-money laundering statute, and avoid running afoul of a federal law that bans unlicensed money transmitters.  While some Bitcoin businesses reject FinCEN’s assertion that they are money transmitters, a number have still registered with the agency, a search of the Treasury bureau’s website shows.  FinCEN sent letters to Bitcoin-related businesses on the Internet that appeared to fall under its definition of money transmitters but had not registered, Hudak said. He said FinCEN will keep sending letters to unregistered Bitcoin businesses.  “As we come across them, and as people tip us off, we’ll make inquiries. That is part of what we do,” Hudak said.  Mike Caldwell, who runs a business out of his Utah home that accepts digital bitcoins from customers and turns them into metal coins that hold the “private key” needed to redeem the currency, received one of FinCEN’s letters, as first reported by the online publication Wired.  Jacobsen, Caldwell’s lawyer, told Compliance Complete that “out of an abundance of caution” Caldwell’s business, Casascius LLC, reacted to the letter by registering with FinCEN and suspending business activity.  “Laws and regulations related to virtual currencies are in a state of flux and we are working to determine how to appropriately comply with any that are applicable to our client. Casascius LLC is committed to furthering the use and acceptance of Bitcoins but is also committed to complying with applicable law,” Jacobsen said.  The identities of the other recipients of FinCEN’s letters are not known.  A legal expert with years of experience representing digital currency firms said FinCEN seemed to be establishing a new regulatory enforcement precedent by warning individual businesses of compliance obligations before taking action.  “Is this setting a new standard that in the future if there are any questionable business models there will be notice given before any action is taken?” said Carol Van Cleef, a partner with the Washington law firm Patton Boggs LLP.  In response, Hudak said the letters are an attempt at gathering information. He likened them to the letters that banks sometimes send to customers seeking information about the customer’s transactions in an effort to determine whether suspect transactions are truly linked to illicit activity.  provides a single source for regulatory news, analysis, rules and developments, with global coverage of more than 230 regulators and exchanges.

Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, said he decided to issue the alert after reviewing dozens of complaints from around the United States from consumers who are unable to withdraw their money from bitcoin exchanges.  The vast majority of the complaints were about Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange that suspended withdrawals indefinitely on February 7 after it detected “unusual activity.” The company is having both “security and technical challenges,” according to an update on its website dated February 20.  Some consumers, however, have been trying to get their money out for as long as four months, Borg said. Their initial deposits ranged from a few hundred dollars to $100,000, he said.  The figures are a concern because they suggest that smaller, “Main Street” investors are among those taking chances on the digital currency, said Borg, former president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group composed mostly of U.S. securities regulators.  Bitcoin exchanges allow their users to trade bitcoins for U.S. dollars and other currencies.  Consumer interest in bitcoin grew when online retailer Overstock.com Inc announced in January that it would accept the currency for purchases. Borg, who became head of the Alabama Securities Commission in 1994, is known for organizing coalitions of regulators from other states in high-profile enforcement cases.  While Borg’s alert may help to promote consumer awareness about the risks of trading on bitcoin exchanges, regulating the marketplace is still far off, he said. Federal agencies will have to step in because the exchanges are international, Borg said.  Some states such as Alabama, however, can regulate bitcoin exchanges as money transmitters, a type of business that transfers money between businesses and individuals, Borg said.  Any approach would require new regulations, Borg said. “Because it’s in the virtual world, it’s not something you can put your hands on.”  Borg’s upcoming alert was reported earlier on Monday by MarketWatch.

The contract, created on behalf of two clients, was a bilateral swap privately negotiated between them. The counterparties had not acted on the agreement, but were expected to do so soon, the company said.  The company said it had shown the contract to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates swaps and futures. If transacted by the counterparties, the contract would need to be reported to the agency.  Regulators have stepped up their efforts to rein in bitcoin after incidents such as the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins.  Bart Chilton, who stepped down from his position as a member of the CFTC on Friday, told Reuters last week that companies had inquired in the past month about regulations that would govern exchanges for bitcoin derivatives.  Ultimately, TeraExchange plans to list the bitcoin swap on its Swap Execution Facility (SEF), a new type of regulated platform that was set up after the credit crisis to make swaps trading more transparent, less risky, and cheaper.  The company was given a license to run a SEF last year, but no trading has taken place on the platform yet.  The novelty of the bitcoin currency has made it hard to categorize, but trading derivatives such as futures or swaps would subject companies to oversight by the CFTC.

The move comes just months after Westpac Banking Corp became the last of Australia’s four major banks to pull out of the remittances business in order to reduce compliance risks.  Banks globally are exiting sectors that present compliance headaches under pressure from regulators to meet tighter anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules.   “The current bitcoin operating model requires very tough compliance and assurance requirements to ensure we meet the high standards required under anti-money laundering regulations,” a Westpac spokesman said.  “We continue to monitor developments in bitcoin, including their regulation.”  Banks have sent letters to 17 bitcoin companies including BitTrade and Buyabitcoin informing them their accounts would be closed, an Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) spokesman said.  “We continue to speak with banks to find a solution to the problem.

483,Japan says any bitcoin regulation should be international,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1Q0I520140227,"February 27, 2014 06:25am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Any regulation of the bitcoin crypto-currency should involve international cooperation to avoid loopholes, Japanese vice finance minister Jiro Aichi said on Thursday.  Commenting on the closure this week of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest exchange for the bitcoin virtual currency, Aichi said the ministry would respond to the problems “if necessary”, after finding out exactly what happened.  “It’s not just the Ministry of Finance; many other agencies are related,” Aichi told a news conference. “As for its legal position, a currency (under Japan’s jurisdiction) would be coins or notes issued by the Bank of Japan. At the very least, we can say bitcoin is not a currency.”  The Mt. Gox website and Twitter feed went blank on Tuesday after weeks of turmoil. It suspended withdrawals on February 7 following a series of cyber attacks, leaving customers unable to recover their funds.  A document circulating on the internet saying that more than 744,000 bitcoins - worth around $423 million at current rates - were missing from Mt. Gox was created by a Tokyo-based consulting firm, said Ryan Selkis, a blogger who initially leaked scans of the document. Selkis, who uses the handle “twobitidiot”, said in an email that the “Crisis Strategy Draft” had been written by consulting firm Mandalah in meetings with Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.  Mandalah said it could not immediately comment.  On Wednesday, Karpeles had sought to assure investors that he was working with others to solve the problems. “As there is a lot of speculation regarding Mt. Gox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues,” he said in a statement posted on the Mt. Gox website.  While proponents of bitcoin hail its anonymity and lack of ties to traditional banking, regulators have become increasingly interested in the digital currency due to its volatility and usage by criminal elements.  Bitcoins are created, or “mined”, in a process using a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction that is made. At current prices, the bitcoin market is worth about $7 billion.  The document leaked this week by Selkis - who says he sold all his bitcoins - said 744,408 bitcoins, or about 6 percent of the 12.4 million bitcoins in circulation, were “missing” due to thefts that exploited “malleability” in the code governing transactions, which the Bitcoin Foundation and others have blamed on Mt. Gox’s customized software.  “Mt. Gox has been broken and it was obvious there was something really bad going on there for nearly a year. They were processing withdrawals very slowly and generally being very opaque about what was going,” said Mike Hearn, a bitcoin developer in Switzerland.  The leaked crisis plan proposed that Mt. Gox reduce its liabilities, switch off the exchange for a month while bringing in transition advisers, and reset all social network channels while rebranding under a different CEO.  Karpeles told Reuters in April 2013 that Mt. Gox was seeing daily inflows of $5-$20 million. He told Forbes his company hadn’t been able to keep up with all the changes as it became the largest exchange in the world.  The crisis plan said Mt. Gox had liabilities of $174 million, based on an assumed exchange rate of $160 per bitcoin - well below the $550 or so offered for bitcoins at other exchanges on Thursday - against assets of $32 million. A financial statement included in that document said Mt. Gox was expected to make $2 million in net income in the year to end-March, a sevenfold increase on the previous year.  It also said Mt. Gox turned a profit in its second year of existence, banking $286,000 in net income. Those figures match a 2013 report by credit research firm Tokyo Shoko Research, which was reviewed by Reuters. It said Mt. Gox “had a strong start”.  Mt. Gox had 600,000 customers at the time, the research report said - 30 percent from the United States, 10 percent from Britain and just 300 in Japan. Given that most users are overseas, any court case to retrieve missing funds would be more likely in the United States than Japan, said Ken Kiyohara, a lawyer at Jones Day. “It probably comes under the (Japanese) Financial Services Agency’s (FSA) remit, but giving a reason for that in one sentence is impossible,” he said.  Officials at the FSA and Finance Ministry each told Reuters bitcoin does not fall within their purview, while the Bank of Japan says only that it is studying the bitcoin phenomenon, which Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has called “interesting.”  People who had bitcoins at Mt. Gox are more definitive.  “It was the only place you could buy bitcoin directly with yen, so it hurts that it’s gone,” said Ryoichi Taga, a fellow at the Japan Digital Money Association.

485,U.S. swaps watchdog says considering bitcoin regulation,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2A1W020140311,"March 11, 2014 06:26pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Boca Raton, Florida (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator is studying whether it should regulate electronic currencies such as bitcoin, its chief said on Tuesday, as regulators across the globe start taking the emerging technology more seriously.  “We are looking into that,” Mark Wetjen, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told journalists after giving a speech at an industry conference. “It’s been initiated, there’s been an internal discussion at the staff level.”  Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been promoted by many enthusiasts because of the way it operates outside government control. But recent incidents, such as the failure of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins, have brought the currency under a new level of scrutiny by regulators.  Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control, or any backing, by a government or a central bank - something that makes it vulnerable to mishaps.  Wetjen said the CFTC, which regulates swaps and futures, has broad authority to counter manipulation of commodity markets, and it is studying whether bitcoin falls under those rules.  “I think people (in the agency) believe there’s a pretty good argument that it would fit that definition,” Wetjen said.  He added, “Then there’s a separate question about whether or not there is some derivative contract based on, or denominated in a virtual currency and whether that’s listed on an exchange. ... There’s some looking into that question too.”  Wetjen said he could not say what would come out of the internal deliberations or give a timeframe.  Separately on Tuesday, New York state’s top financial services regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, said he wanted prospective virtual currency exchange operators to submit formal applications, a first step toward eventual regulation.  And the brokerage industry’s own watchdog, FINRA, warned that bitcoin can expose people to significant losses, fraud and theft, and the lure of a potential quick profit should not blind investors to the virtual currency’s significant risks.

486,"'Pony' botnet steals bitcoins, digital currencies: Trustwave",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA1N1JO20140224,"February 24, 2014 02:23pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Cyber criminals have infected hundreds of thousands of computers with a virus called “Pony” to steal bitcoins and other digital currencies, in the most ambitious cyber attack on virtual money uncovered so far, according to security firm Trustwave.  Trustwave said on Monday that it has found evidence that the operators of a cybercrime ring known as the Pony botnet have stolen some 85 virtual “wallets” that contained bitcoins and other types of digital currencies. The firm said it did not know how much digital currency was contained in the wallets.  “It is the first time we saw such a widespread presence of this type of malware. It was on hundreds of thousands of machines,” said Ziv Mador, security research director with Chicago-based Trustwave.  Trustwave said it believes the crime ring is still operating, though it does not know who is running the group. The company said it has disrupted the servers that were controlling machines infected with Pony, but expects the group to launch more attacks on virtual currency users.  A representative for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group that promotes adoption of the virtual currency, advised bitcoin users to store their currency offline in a secure location to prevent cyber criminals from stealing them.  “Electronic wallet security continues to improve by leaps and bounds as hardware wallets become available and we start to see software wallets that support multi-signature transactions,” said the Bitcoin Foundation’s director of public affairs, Jinyoung Lee Englund.  Trustwave’s discovery comes after an unrelated cyber attack that spammed bitcoin exchanges earlier this month. That attack prompted at least three online virtual currency traders to halt withdrawals, causing bitcoin’s value to plunge 33 percent over three weeks.  Bitcoin is a digital currency sustained by software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers. It is not governed by any one company or person, and its value is determined by user demand.  People who buy digital currency can store it in virtual wallets on their own machines or with companies that offer storage and security services.  Mador said digital currency theft is still in its infancy, but that it is likely to grow. He said that digital currency buyers can protect themselves from hackers by using encrypted files.  “Most websites don’t encrypt them by default, but you can turn them on,” he added.  Botnets are collections of infected computers that take orders from central “command and control” servers. The botnets steal data from compromised PCs and can also deliver other types of malware that force them to perform tasks.  This is at least the third type of fraud to surface involving digital currencies. Criminals have previously hacked into marketplaces where digital currencies are traded by exploiting security flaws in those sites, then stealing those currencies, according to Trustwave. (bit.ly/1hphzRj)  Cyber criminals have also developed botnets that force enslaved computers to create, or “mine”, digital currencies, which the fraudsters then claim as their own.  Bitcoin mining is a time-consuming process in which computers perform complex math calculations. The operators of those botnets are stealing electricity and data center resources when they use compromised machines to mine digital currencies.  Trustwave in December uncovered a trove of some 2 million stolen passwords to websites including Facebook Inc, Google Inc, Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc while probing a command and control server using a less sophisticated version of the Pony malware.  Trustwave said on Monday that the new version of Pony compromised another 600,000 website credentials.

487,Bitcoin goes mainstream with ATM in Vancouver coffee shop,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0IJ00U20131029,"October 29, 2013 06:52pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"VANCOUVER, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A silver and blue ATM, perched up next to the espresso bar in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop, could launch a new era for the digital currency bitcoin, offering an almost instant way to exchange the  world’s leading virtual money for cash.  The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise.  The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins.  “It’s as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin,” said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. “With this, it’s a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it’s at least two days.”  Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is.  With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.  Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the United States, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators.  “We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we’re excited to be here,” said Kelley. “By the end 2013, we’ll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we’ll be all over the world, including the United States.”  Bitcoin is not a recognized currency in Canada, so Ottawa’s anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.  Still Bitcoiniacs’ founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them.  “We’re already being proactive in our business,” said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. “We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the ‘know you customer’ laws and anti-money laundering laws.”  Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system’s control over the minting of money.  Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.  The currency’s reputation took a hit this month, when U.S. regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6 million in bitcoins.  But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.  “I think it’s definitely going mainstream,” said Demeter. “I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.”  In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers.  At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency.  “It’s been said that we’re at the stage where email was in 1992,” he said. “Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the Internet and email changed the world.”",0.15370666666666669,0.05353998316498317

490,Bitcoin promoter pleads guilty to unlicensed use of currency,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0GZ2OG20140904,"September 04, 2014 06:24pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A man who helped to promote bitcoin wants to remain in the business despite pleading guilty Thursday to indirectly helping send more than $1 million in the digital currency to users of the illicit online marketplace Silk Road, his lawyer said.  Charlie Shrem, 24, pleaded guilty at a hearing in New York federal court to one count of aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting business.   A co-conspirator, Robert Faiella, 54, separately pleaded guilty to operating such a business. Both men face up to five years in prison when they appear again in court in January.  “I knew that much of the business on Silk Road involved the buying and selling of narcotics,” Shrem said in court. “I knew that what I was doing was wrong.”  His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said that what Shrem did was an aberration and that Shrem plans to continue working in the bitcoin world if possible. Agnifilo emphasized that his client was not involved in directly supplying bitcoin to Silk Road users.  “We believe he is at least one step more removed from the heartland of illegal conduct, which is really Silk Road,” the lawyer said.  The two pleaded guilty as part of a deal struck with prosecutors from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. They had been scheduled to go on trial Sept. 22.  U.S. authorities shut down Silk Road last year, though a new version bearing the same name was launched soon thereafter. The man accused of creating and operating Silk Road using the alias “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ross William Ulbricht, is facing separate charges and is scheduled for trial in November.  Shrem stepped down from his post as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group, soon after his arrest in January. He was previously the chief executive of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company.  Prosecutors said Faiella, 54, operated an underground bitcoin exchange on Silk Road under the name “BTCKing,” providing currency for users engaged in illicit drug trafficking.  Shrem processed transactions for Faiella through BitInstant despite knowing the bitcoin would eventually find their way to Silk Road, where the funds would be used for drugs, he said in court.  Both men agreed to forfeit $950,000 to the government as part of their plea deals.  “Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem opted to travel down a crooked path - running an illegal money transmitting business that catered to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road,” Bharara said in a statement.

The new idea is to build “leveraged” and “inverse” funds that would rise - or fall - twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day.  Direxion Asset Management LLC plans to list such products on Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s NYSE Arca exchange if U.S. securities regulators give the nod, according to a filing by the exchange this week.  In the filing, the exchange said the listing “will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.”      Bitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.  Bitcoin is one of the wildest trades in the market today, delivering sharp gains and losses that defy explanation. Trading has been expensive and difficult, with brokerages offering limited access and specialist websites like Coinbase reporting regular outages. Top voices on markets from economist Robert Shiller to JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon have warned people off buying bitcoin.  Yet asset managers have been racing to design more than 10 proposals for bitcoin funds that are currently before U.S. regulators.  New ETFs could make access to bitcoin easier and, in the case of the Direxion product, mean bigger stakes for investors, with a 25 percent gain or loss on one day doubled to 50 percent.   So far the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has declined or put on hold all the proposals.  A spokesman representing Direxion declined to comment on the latest filing as did a representative from NYSE.  Bitcoin gained nearly 12 percent on Friday to $16,928 on the Bitstamp exchange.

492,Merrill Lynch bans clients from investing in Silbert bitcoin fund,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1OY1UM,"January 03, 2018 07:44pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch banned clients from investing in one of bitcoin mogul Barry Silbert’s top funds last month, according to a memo seen by Reuters.  As of Dec. 8, the Wall Street brokerage stopped approving new orders for the Bitcoin Investment Trust due to concerns about the “suitability and eligibility standards of this product,” according to the memo sent to roughly 17,000 brokers at Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge, a unit for clients who manage their own trades.  Bitcoin Investment Trust is run by Grayscale Investments, which is led by Silbert. A former Wall Street investment banker and prominent supporter of cryptocurrencies, Silbert’s role in the world of digital coins was the subject of a Reuters special report last month.  “We look forward to speaking with Merrill Lynch and addressing any questions or concerns they have about the Bitcoin Investment Trust,” Silbert told Reuters in an email. “We are unaware of any similar policies at other brokerage firms.”  Wall Street has taken a cautious approach to digital currencies, which are unregulated and have very volatile trading patterns. Last month, Chicago-based derivatives exchanges Cboe Global Markets and the CME Group launched bitcoin futures, but some banks and brokerages remain reluctant to trade them.  Millions of investors have piled into bitcoin and other digital currencies prompting warnings of a bubble from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has likened bitcoin to a “fraud” that will eventually blow up.  Shares in Bitcoin Investment Trust jumped over 1,550 percent last year, more than the 1,300 percent plus gain of bitcoin.  The fund was created for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin and trades “over the counter” in less formal exchanges than those used for typical stocks.  Before last month’s ban, clients of Merrill Lynch’s brokerage and Merrill Edge were able to buy stakes in Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trade at a fraction of a bitcoin. The digital currency is currently valued at around $15,000.  Merrill Lynch brokerage clients with historic positions in the Bitcoin Investment Trust fund can maintain them, but clients with fee-based advisory accounts have to sell their holdings, according to the memo.

493,INSIGHT-Insurers gingerly test bitcoin business with heist policies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1PD211,"February 01, 2018 01:00am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major global insurers are starting to offer protection against cryptocurrency theft, willing to tackle daunting challenges it brings rather than miss out on this volatile and loosely regulated, but rapidly growing business.  So far only a few insurers sell such insurance, including XL Catlin, Chubb, and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance . Yet several others told Reuters they are looking into theft coverage for companies that handle digital currencies like bitcoin and ether, which trade between anonymous parties.  Such efforts so far have garnered little attention, but the emergence of an insurance market marks an important step for the nascent industry’s mainstream recognition.  The risks are clear: digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks, technical errors and fraud. Many hacked exchanges later shuttered.  On Friday, Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck became the latest casualty, reporting a loss of around $534 million worth of coins to hackers.  For insurers the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about, who use technology few understand and represent a young industry that lacks troves of data insurers usually rely on in designing and pricing coverage.  Christopher Liu, who heads American International Group Inc’s North American cyber insurance practice for financial institutions, said the answer is to find an established business with a similar risk profile and try to adapt what works there.  “It’s sort of akin to a digital armored car service,” he said about cryptocurrency firms. “If there is a problem – like an accident or a robbery - that’s going to be the accumulation of all these exposures.” Liu says AIG began researching cryptocurrency theft coverage in 2014 and has written a few such policies, but remains in an “exploratory phase.”  Greg Bangs, head of XL Catlin’s North America crime coverage underwriting recounts how the firm had to become its own expert on the new technology by talking to key players and potential clients before developing bitcoin theft insurance.  “The first challenge for us was to figure out if there was a product here.” XL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to $25 million per incident, Bangs said.  Knowing the customer also takes on special importance.  Jackie Quintal, who advises financial institutions for insurance broker Aon Plc, said part of her job is to tell legitimate digital currency companies from shady ones, something that often gets cleared up even before an insurer gets involved.  “If someone is hesitant to provide information and they don’t have answers to compliance questions, they tend to disappear on their own,” she said.  Still, insurers spend more time than usual scrutinizing everything from security and storage procedures, the scale of their operations, to the people involved - a process that can take several months.  “Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets weren’t anticipating the level of underwriting and due diligence that they undergo when they approach the market,” said Matt Prevost, who heads Chubb’s North American Cyber Product Line.  Insurers like Chubb are betting that cryptocurrencies will gain wider recognition even if the new business now represents only a tiny sliver of the global $720 billion per year commercial insurance business.  Digital coin sales raised more than $5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights. There are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected.   COOL ON “HOT STORAGE”  Many insurers remain wary of the new business. Some, like Great American Insurance Group, an American Financial Group Inc unit, offer protection from employee theft to companies that accept bitcoin payments, but avoid outside risks, such as hacking. The company added the coverage to its standard employee theft policy in 2014.  Others will avoid coverage for coins kept online, or in ""hot storage,"" because of high risk of hacking and will only cover offline “cold storage,” which is also generally preferred by cryptocurrency companies. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2DNRkFu)  Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange available in 32 countries, says on its website it holds less than 2 percent of customer funds online and that those funds are insured.  Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance marketplace, was providing insurance to the exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not determine the terms or the scope of the coverage and a Lloyd’s spokesman declined to discuss Coinbase.  He said that member companies have written a small number of policies for cryptocurrencies in recent years and Lloyd’s was requiring members to proceed with caution and use additional scrutiny of cryptocurrency companies.  Some insurers are not yet convinced the cryptocurrency business is large enough for premiums to cover possible losses.  “We’re looking at it, but does it make sense to offer a market for that?” said Frank Scheckton, President of Great American’s Fidelity Crime Division.  Right now, costs act as a deterrent for small firms and startups, said Ty Sagalow, chief executive of Innovation Insurance Group LLC, which has been developing coverage for cryptocurrency companies since 2013.  “It’s an expensive product that many companies can’t afford,” he said.  Annual premiums for $10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about $200,000, or 2 percent of the limit, insurance experts say. That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients, depending on the company, loss history and other factors.  Currency volatility is another concern. While coverage limits shield insurers from wild swings, the impact for clients can be dramatic. For example, a $10 million policy signed in January 2017 would cover 10,957 bitcoins at the time, but only 923 if a hack happened a year later.  Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, argues insurance should not be an investor’s primary concern.  As a registered New York trust company, Gemini carries state-mandated insurance against employee theft, computer fraud, and fund transfer fraud, but has no coverage for hacking, Winklevoss, who founded the firm with his twin brother Tyler, said.  “The key is to look for regulatory oversight that ensures that an exchange is doing what it should be doing so that it doesn’t get to the point where you have to fall back on an insurance policy,” he told Reuters.  However, Henry Sanderson, who oversees cyber and technology coverage for Safeonline LLP, a Lloyd’s broker, argues cryptocurrency insurance can help the young industry mature while creating new business for insurers.  This whole space is maturing and growing,” he said. “If we don’t embrace it now, it’s a missed opportunity for insurers.”   (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London, Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Anna Irrera in New York; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)",-0.034234883720930226,0.08437246668060622

495,"Australian says he created bitcoin, but some skeptical",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XT0H6,"May 02, 2016 06:17pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - Australian tech entrepreneur Craig Wright identified himself as the creator of controversial digital currency bitcoin on Monday but experts were divided over whether he really was the elusive person who has gone by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto until now.  Uncovering Nakamoto’s real identity would solve a riddle dating back to the publication of the open source software behind the cryptocurrency in 2008, before its launch a year later.  Bitcoin has since become the world’s most commonly used virtual currency, attracting the interest of banks, speculators, criminals and regulators.  Worth a total of $7 billion at current levels, it fell more than 3 percent on Monday — a normal intraday move for the volatile currency — after the news, to below $440 from around $455, before recovering slightly.  Some online commentators suggested bitcoin’s creator could help resolve a bitter row among the currency’s software developers that threatens its future.  But Wright made no reference to the row in a BBC interview identifying himself as Nakamoto, and as the protocol bitcoin runs on is open-source and cannot be controlled by any one person, it is unclear whether he would be able to influence the way it develops.  “I was the main part of it, other people helped me,” Wright, who is now living in London, told the BBC. “Some people will believe, Some people won’t, and to tell you the truth, I don’t really care,” he said.  Many bitcoiners said Wright had not done enough to definitively prove that he was Nakamoto, who maintained his anonymity throughout his involvement with bitcoin, which he stepped away from in 2011.  But Gavin Andresen, who Nakamoto chose to succeed him, published a blog post in which he described meeting Wright last month and said he is “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt” that the Australian is Nakamoto.  Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation now works as a bitcoin consultant, wrote a blog post on Monday which, like Andresen’s, supported Wright’s claims.  “According to me, the proof is conclusive and I have no doubt that Craig Steven Wright is the person behind the Bitcoin technology, Nakamoto consensus, and the Satoshi Nakamoto name,” Matonis wrote. He and Andresen also confirmed they had been responsible for their respective blog posts to Reuters directly.  Nakamoto’s biggest likely legacy lies well beyond his control. The blockchain technology that underpins the currency could transform the way banks settle transactions, the way that property rights and other vital data are recorded, and provide a way for central banks to issue their own digital currencies.  The BBC reported on Monday that Wright gave some technical proof demonstrating that he had access to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created by bitcoin’s creator.  Researchers believe Nakamoto may be holding up to one million of the more than 15 million bitcoins currently in circulation, which would make the creator worth around $440 million.  In a blog post also dated Monday, Wright posted an example of a signature used by Nakamoto and an explanation of how bitcoin transactions are verified and thanked all those who had supported the project from its inception.  “This incredible community’s passion and intellect and perseverance have taken my small contribution and nurtured it, enhanced it, breathed life into it,” he wrote.  However he did not state directly that he was Nakamoto. “Satoshi is dead,” he said. “But this is only the beginning.”  Bitcoin expert Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group Coin Center, said a new message cryptographically signed using the private key associated with the so-called Genesis block, the first ever “mined” would have been more convincing.  The currency’s “miners” are incentivized to process transactions every 10 minutes by a possible reward of bitcoins (25 currently), which is how new bitcoins are created.  Wright also spoke with The Economist, but declined requests from the magazine to provide further proof that he was Nakamoto. His representatives told Reuters he would not be taking part in more media interviews for the time being.   “Our conclusion is that Mr Wright could well be Mr Nakamoto, but that important questions remain,” The Economist said. “Indeed, it may never be possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt who really created bitcoin.”  Hopes that bitcoin would become broadly used helped buoy its price to more than $1,000 in December 2013, when its market capitalization was $13 billion compared with today’s $7 billion.  Wright told The Economist he would exchange bitcoin he owns slowly to avoid pushing down its price.   In December, police raided Wright’s Sydney home and office after Wired magazine named him as the probable creator of bitcoin and holder of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency. At the time he made no comment.  The treatment of bitcoins for tax purposes in Australia has been the subject of considerable debate. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) ruled in December 2014 that cryptocurrency should be considered an asset, rather than a currency, for capital gains tax purposes.  On Monday, the ATO said it had no comment while police were not immediately available for comment.  If Wright is Nakamoto he “is now the leader of a movement”, said Roberto Capodieci, a Singapore-based entrepreneur working on the blockchain, the technology underlying the currency.  That movement ranges from libertarian enthusiasts to central banks experimenting with digital currencies, all of which pay homage in some way to Nakamoto’s writings.

496,U.S. companies list blockchain ETFs as bitcoin proposals languish,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F52PV,"January 16, 2018 07:54pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors looking to profit from excitement surrounding bitcoin technology will get a new opportunity this week.  Funds coming to market on Wednesday will purchase shares of companies, such as Hitachi Ltd, Accenture plc and Overstock.com Inc, that may benefit from the digital asset’s underlying technology.  Rather than buying wild-trading “cryptocurrencies” themselves, the funds’ tactic has mollified uneasy regulators who have denied or tabled more than a dozen proposals for funds that would own bitcoin or futures based on them.  Amplify Investments LLC and Reality Shares Inc are each launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in companies betting on blockchain, the decentralized technology bitcoin uses to keep a running record of transactions.  Companies from JPMorgan Chase & Co to Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp said blockchain can help them streamline processes, such as settling financial transactions.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) insisted the ETFs not include the word blockchain in their names if the stocks they hold do not directly collect a significant portion of their revenue from the technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News first reported the SEC’s discussions with companies over their funds’ proposed names.  But the funds - Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF and Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF - will nonetheless trade with the tickers BLOK and BLCN.  Bitcoin’s 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the asset.  Bitcoin last fell 15.5 percent to $11,500 on the Bitstamp exchange following reports suggesting South Korea could ban trading in cryptocurrencies.  The Reality Shares fund’s backers have said that buying companies that use blockchain to cut costs or start new business lines is a more conservative approach to investing than buying bitcoin directly because those companies are dependent on more factors than just that technology succeeding.  Eastman Kodak Co shares more than doubled last week after the one-time photography leader said it would launch a cryptocurrency called KODAKCoin.  Soft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea’s shares have doubled since that company shifted its focus to blockchain and changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp.  Three other companies have filed proposals for funds that invest primarily in stocks with blockchain exposure.

497,DERIVATIVES-CBOE and Gemini strike bitcoin data agreement,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1KO5HK,"August 02, 2017 10:48am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON, Aug 2 (IFR) - CBOE Holdings has entered into a agreement with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini for bitcoin data that will support the Chicago bourse’s plans to list bitcoin derivatives.  The multi-year agreement sees Gemini, which was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, provide daily bitcoin auction values to the exchange giant. The data will support the development of CBOE’s cash-settled futures that are slated for launch on the bourse’s CFE futures exchange in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018, pending a review by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The agreement also provides CBOE with exclusive rights to use Gemini market data for the creation of new indices. That could extend to VIX-style indices that would provide a measure of volatility on the cryptocurrency and potential volatility trading opportunities if a liquid bitcoin options market were to emerge.  Interest in the cryptocurrency has increased alongside a near-tripling of bitcoin’s value since the start of the year. The currency hit an all-time high of US$2,954 in mid-June. Trading volume has grown substantially over the last five years as market capitalisation of outstanding bitcoin tokens jumped from under US$1bn to almost US$50bn. The currency represents around half of the entire cryptocurrency market, which has around US$100bn, outstanding according to CBOE.  Performance defies a setback in March, when the SEC rejected an application from the Winklevoss twins - most noted for their high-profile bust-up with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook - to list exchange-traded funds linked to the digital currency on the BATS exchange.  The agreement with CBOE, which acquired BATS earlier this year, could help to allay some concerns around the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency market - cited by the SEC in its ETF rejection.  Gemini is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. With limited liability trust company status, it has a legal obligation to protect the interest and assets of customers.  “Gemini’s key concerns in the cryptocurrency ecosystem have always been security, compliance, and regulatory oversight. By working with the team at CBOE, we are helping to make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies increasingly accessible to both retail and institutional investors.” Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement.  According to Ed Tilly, CBOE’s chairman and CEO, the bourse’s broad focus on options, derivatives, VIX, ETFs and FX makes it a natural home for the development and trading of bitcoin futures.  “We very much look forward to responding to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies through the creation of bitcoin futures traded on a regulated derivatives exchange, with the many expected benefits that this brings, including transparency, price discovery, deep liquidity and centralised clearing,” he said in a statement.

498,RPT-INSIGHT-Insurers gingerly test bitcoin business with heist policies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1PR03F,"February 01, 2018 07:00am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Repeats for wider distribution)  By Suzanne Barlyn  NEW YORK, Feb 1(Reuters) - Major global insurers are starting to offer protection against cryptocurrency theft, willing to tackle daunting challenges it brings rather than miss out on this volatile and loosely regulated, but rapidly growing business.  So far only a few insurers sell such insurance, including XL Catlin, Chubb, and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance . Yet several others told Reuters they are looking into theft coverage for companies that handle digital currencies like bitcoin and ether, which trade between anonymous parties.  Such efforts so far have garnered little attention, but the emergence of an insurance market marks an important step for the nascent industry’s mainstream recognition.  The risks are clear: digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks, technical errors and fraud. Many hacked exchanges later shuttered.  On Friday, Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck became the latest casualty, reporting a loss of around $534 million worth of coins to hackers.  For insurers the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about, who use technology few understand and represent a young industry that lacks troves of data insurers usually rely on in designing and pricing coverage.  Christopher Liu, who heads American International Group Inc’s North American cyber insurance practice for financial institutions, said the answer is to find an established business with a similar risk profile and try to adapt what works there.  “It’s sort of akin to a digital armored car service,” he said about cryptocurrency firms. “If there is a problem – like an accident or a robbery - that’s going to be the accumulation of all these exposures.” Liu says AIG began researching cryptocurrency theft coverage in 2014 and has written a few such policies, but remains in an “exploratory phase.”  Greg Bangs, head of XL Catlin’s North America crime coverage underwriting recounts how the firm had to become its own expert on the new technology by talking to key players and potential clients before developing bitcoin theft insurance.  “The first challenge for us was to figure out if there was a product here.” XL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to $25 million per incident, Bangs said.  Knowing the customer also takes on special importance.  Jackie Quintal, who advises financial institutions for insurance broker Aon Plc, said part of her job is to tell legitimate digital currency companies from shady ones, something that often gets cleared up even before an insurer gets involved.  “If someone is hesitant to provide information and they don’t have answers to compliance questions, they tend to disappear on their own,” she said.  Still, insurers spend more time than usual scrutinizing everything from security and storage procedures, the scale of their operations, to the people involved - a process that can take several months.  “Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets weren’t anticipating the level of underwriting and due diligence that they undergo when they approach the market,” said Matt Prevost, who heads Chubb’s North American Cyber Product Line.  Insurers like Chubb are betting that cryptocurrencies will gain wider recognition even if the new business now represents only a tiny sliver of the global $720 billion per year commercial insurance business.  Digital coin sales raised more than $5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights. There are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected.  Many insurers remain wary of the new business. Some, like Great American Insurance Group, an American Financial Group Inc unit, offer protection from employee theft to companies that accept bitcoin payments, but avoid outside risks, such as hacking. The company added the coverage to its standard employee theft policy in 2014.  Others will avoid coverage for coins kept online, or in ""hot storage,"" because of high risk of hacking and will only cover offline “cold storage,” which is also generally preferred by cryptocurrency companies. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2DNRkFu)  Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange available in 32 countries, says on its website it holds less than 2 percent of customer funds online and that those funds are insured.  Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance marketplace, was providing insurance to the exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not determine the terms or the scope of the coverage and a Lloyd’s spokesman declined to discuss Coinbase.  He said that member companies have written a small number of policies for cryptocurrencies in recent years and Lloyd’s was requiring members to proceed with caution and use additional scrutiny of cryptocurrency companies.  Some insurers are not yet convinced the cryptocurrency business is large enough for premiums to cover possible losses.  “We’re looking at it, but does it make sense to offer a market for that?” said Frank Scheckton, President of Great American’s Fidelity Crime Division.  Right now, costs act as a deterrent for small firms and startups, said Ty Sagalow, chief executive of Innovation Insurance Group LLC, which has been developing coverage for cryptocurrency companies since 2013.  “It’s an expensive product that many companies can’t afford,” he said.  Annual premiums for $10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about $200,000, or 2 percent of the limit, insurance experts say. That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients, depending on the company, loss history and other factors.  Currency volatility is another concern. While coverage limits shield insurers from wild swings, the impact for clients can be dramatic. For example, a $10 million policy signed in January 2017 would cover 10,957 bitcoins at the time, but only 923 if a hack happened a year later.  Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, argues insurance should not be an investor’s primary concern.  As a registered New York trust company, Gemini carries state-mandated insurance against employee theft, computer fraud, and fund transfer fraud, but has no coverage for hacking, Winklevoss, who founded the firm with his twin brother Tyler, said.  “The key is to look for regulatory oversight that ensures that an exchange is doing what it should be doing so that it doesn’t get to the point where you have to fall back on an insurance policy,” he told Reuters.  However, Henry Sanderson, who oversees cyber and technology coverage for Safeonline LLP, a Lloyd’s broker, argues cryptocurrency insurance can help the young industry mature while creating new business for insurers.  This whole space is maturing and growing,” he said. “If we don’t embrace it now, it’s a missed opportunity for insurers.”  Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Additional reporting by Carolyn

Bitcoin fell sharply on Friday after Chinese financial publication Caixin reported that China was planning to shut down local crypto-currency exchanges, although analysts said this was just a temporary setback.

500,London stakes its claim as global bitcoin hub,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0N622320150415,"April 15, 2015 01:17pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - London, center of the $5-trillion-a-day global currency market, now wants to be home to a controversial upstart - bitcoin.  British authorities have come out in support of digital currencies in the name of promoting financial innovation, while proposing that regulations should be drawn up to prevent their use in crime.  But it is technophiles who are leading the drive to make London a real-world hub for trade in web-based “cryptocurrencies”, of which bitcoin is the original and still most popular.  Every Tuesday evening in a trendy cafe in London’s Shoreditch neighborhood, a group of digital currency enthusiasts gathers to discuss ideas, “vape” from e-cigarettes and exchange their pounds for bitcoins in a dedicated “ATM”.  With more than 2,200 members, CoinScrum, run by a former derivatives trader who left the world of traditional finance to work on a digital currency start-up, is the biggest bitcoin networking group in the world. Its meetings draw a mostly young, mostly male crowd - some amateurs, others who have come to Britain to start bitcoin businesses.   Already the capital of traditional currency trading, London is competing with San Francisco’s web expertise and New York’s financial clout as it pushes to be the foremost financial technology - or fintech - center in the world.  Last month the British government announced plans to regulate digital currency exchanges to prevent their use in money-laundering, and to help to develop a set of standards for cryptocurrencies.  Backers of bitcoin praised this for lending legitimacy to the currency - which unlike traditional money has no printed form and remains outside the control of central banks - without stifling innovation.  “London has been the home of financial innovation for hundreds of years,” said Nicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain, which provides bitcoin data and “wallet” software for storing the currency. “It would be a historical mistake not to make this the home of digital currencies. There’s an incredible amount of talent and experience here.”   Just over 14 million bitcoins are in circulation, worth  around $3.1 billion at the current exchange rate of around $220 each.  Bitcoin brought 29-year-old Cary to Britain two years ago from Denver, Colorado. He joined forces with Ben Reeves, then a 22-year-old computer science graduate, to develop the Blockchain wallet, spending the first year working out of a two-bedroom apartment in northern England.   Now Blockchain, named after the technology behind bitcoin, is the world’s biggest wallet provider, with over 3 million users. Last year it raised over $30 million in its first round of funding, including from billionaire Richard Branson.   While some people argue that London lags New York overall as the center for traditional finance, many say the latter’s attitude to digital currencies - including a state plan to impose a “BitLicense” on bitcoin start-ups - makes London more attractive for the growing number of businesses dealing in the budding technology.  “What we see in the UK ... is a different attitude,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a Washington DC-based non-profit advocacy group for digital currencies.   “It’s a very positive attitude, one of: this is an amazing innovation, we’re going to have to have some kind of regulation in terms of money laundering, but let’s do this in a constructive way, in partnership with the technologists and the industry.”  Detractors worry that digital currencies make it easy for users to buy products anonymously from websites like Silk Road, an underground marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods which was shut down in 2013.  But advocates argue that using cash for illicit trades is easier and less traceable, pointing out that most U.S. banknotes are contaminated with cocaine.   Asked about bitcoin, the governing body for the City of London financial district said authorities needed to be “alive to the potential risks and take strong action if they find evidence of abuse or criminal activities”. But the employment and growth opportunities offered by the fintech in general were to be welcomed, it said.  Britain made bitcoin trading exempt from value-added tax last year. Other countries have yet to decide how to tax bitcoin, since its independence from any central bank means it does not fall into the traditional definition of money.   However, Australia has made bitcoin transactions subject to goods and services tax. That helped to drive CoinJar, an Australian company that allows users to buy, sell and spend bitcoins, to move its headquarters to London last December.   Later this month Swiss banking giant UBS will open a technology lab in London to explore the wider application of the technology in the financial services industry.   Finance minister George Osborne has said he wants Britain to lead the world in developing fintech, highlighting the potential of digital currencies.   Last year investment in fintech firms in Britain and Ireland more than doubled compared with 2013, to $623 million, representing 42 percent of such investment in Europe, according to consultancy Accenture.  Alongside the new regulation and standards, the British government promised an additional 10 million pounds ($15 million) for a research initiative that will look into the blockchain technology behind digital currencies.   It is the blockchain - essentially a ledger of every bitcoin transaction that is virtually impossible to tamper with - that the Bank of England has also said could be revolutionary. Central banks, it has said, could eventually issue digital currencies of their own.   Dozens of others have copied this technology to set up their own digital currencies, though none has so far managed to knock bitcoin off the top spot.   Londoners can change cash for bitcoins at seven ATMs in the capital, and use them to pay for anything from tantric massage to a designer dress, a pork chop to a pint of beer. One company even allows rent on property to be paid in bitcoin.   Back in the trendy “Vape Lab” e-cigarette cafe, one young bitcoiner was putting 800 pounds’ worth of 20 pound notes into a bitcoin ATM in exchange for the digital currency.   “I just sell bitcoin to others, because they don’t know how to do it, so I take advantage of that and I make a profit,” he said.   ($1 = 0.6774 pounds)  editing by David Stamp",0.15506923076923076,0.08422318503175148
501,Merrill Lynch bans clients from investing in Silbert bitcoin fund,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ET02N,"January 03, 2018 07:54pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch banned clients from investing in one of bitcoin mogul Barry Silbert’s top funds last month, according to a memo seen by Reuters.  As of Dec. 8, the Wall Street brokerage stopped approving new orders for the Bitcoin Investment Trust due to concerns about the “suitability and eligibility standards of this product,” according to the memo sent to roughly 17,000 brokers at Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge, a unit for clients who manage their own trades.  Bitcoin Investment Trust is run by Grayscale Investments, which is led by Silbert. A former Wall Street investment banker and prominent supporter of cryptocurrencies, Silbert’s role in the world of digital coins was the subject of a Reuters special report last month.  “We look forward to speaking with Merrill Lynch and addressing any questions or concerns they have about the Bitcoin Investment Trust,” Silbert told Reuters in an email. “We are unaware of any similar policies at other brokerage firms.”  Wall Street has taken a cautious approach to digital currencies, which are unregulated and have very volatile trading patterns. Last month, Chicago-based derivatives exchanges Cboe Global Markets and the CME Group launched bitcoin futures, but some banks and brokerages remain reluctant to trade them.  Millions of investors have piled into bitcoin and other digital currencies prompting warnings of a bubble from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has likened bitcoin to a “fraud” that will eventually blow up.  Shares in Bitcoin Investment Trust jumped over 1,550 percent last year, more than the 1,300 percent plus gain of bitcoin.  The fund was created for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin and trades “over the counter” in less formal exchanges than those used for typical stocks.  Before last month’s ban, clients of Merrill Lynch’s brokerage and Merrill Edge were able to buy stakes in Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trade at a fraction of a bitcoin. The digital currency is currently valued at around $15,000.  Merrill Lynch brokerage clients with historic positions in the Bitcoin Investment Trust fund can maintain them, but clients with fee-based advisory accounts have to sell their holdings, according to the memo.

502,"Bitcoin has a governance problem, no matter who created it",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XX1WU,"May 06, 2016 02:04pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - As one would-be father of bitcoin falls by the wayside, squabbling among the web-based currency’s lead developers is exposing a fundamental flaw: it must evolve to meet growing demand, but may lack a governance structure to achieve this.  The latest bickering erupted after Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright promised to prove he was the mysterious creator of bitcoin - which allows users to move money across the world quickly and anonymously - but then said on Thursday he could not provide further evidence to back this up.  Wright stopped short of reneging on his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who launched the digital cryptocurrency in 2009. However, he apologized for damaging the reputations of bitcoin experts who had believed him.  Many members of the bitcoin community reckon this is all a distraction and agree with Wright when he said that the identity of Nakamoto “doesn’t, and shouldn’t, matter”.  “Satoshi’s biggest achievement was to create a system that doesn’t require his participation to run,” said Peter Todd, one of bitcoin’s core software developers. “That’s what makes all this stuff kind of funny. It’s like searching for the creator of a system that’s designed not to require a creator.”  While gray-suited central bankers print conventional currencies and commercial banks control transactions in them,  no one person or entity is in charge of bitcoin. Instead it runs on a decentralized system of shared trust without any third-party verification of transactions - one reason why many people are attracted to it.   Critics, however, say it needs a “benevolent dictator” or at least some “adults” to manage the expansion that it needs to cope with the increasing number of transactions. Someone, or some group, must decide how to meet users’ requirements, they say.  Trades are handled by thousands of “mining” computers around the world which validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes.  The first computer to solve the puzzle clears the transaction and is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, now worth around $11,250. BTC=BTSP. This is how the computers' owners cover their costs - largely power bills - and make a profit. The system also ensures there is no single point in the system that might fail.   In practice, there do appear to be people who can make decisions, but it is also possible to be excluded from this magic circle.  One of the bitcoin experts who initially believed Wright’s claim is Gavin Andresen. Nakamoto handed control of bitcoin’s software to Andresen when he stepped aside in 2011, a transfer that kept the creator’s identity a mystery as it was conducted in cyberspace without human contact.  Andresen later shared that control with others. But when he stated publicly he believed Wright, skeptical developers responded by revoking his “commit access” to a shared repository of bitcoin rules.  Initially, these developers justified their move on security grounds, saying his computer must have been hacked - something  Andresen denied. When Reuters asked Todd whether Andresen’s access would be reinstated, he responded: “Heck no”, saying a belief in Wright amounted to “inexcusable incompetence”.  Andresen admitted to bewilderment over whether he still believed Wright’s claims. “Ask me in six months; I don’t trust my own judgment right now after all the drama,” he said on Twitter.  The squabbling is not new. One of the lead developers, Mike Hearn, stood down from bitcoin in January because of a power struggle nicknamed the “bitcoin civil war”.  Hearn and Andresen had proposed increasing the size of the blocks in which transactions are processed but the other developers opposed this. In quitting, Hearn said that “what was meant to be a new, decentralized form of money that lacked systemically important institutions” had now become “a system completely controlled by just a handful of people”.  Many investors and start-up firms remain optimistic about bitcoin and are making money from it. But Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University, said the appearance of internal conflict was undermining it.  “For bitcoin to retain its value, it’s important to have hope that there’s good management in charge, that there are adults in charge,” Sirer said. “When we see opportunistic moves, that’s a problem.”  But Sirer also said that any open-source project such as bitcoin, which runs using software that anyone can access, change, and distribute, faces the challenge of governance.   “Is it a pipe dream to expect to be able to build a currency system that is completely decentralized and free of any control whatsoever? The short answer to that is yes, but that’s not what anyone should have expected anyway,” he said.   Sirer added that he was concerned that his brightest young students at Cornell were being deterred from getting involved with bitcoin because of the in-fighting and the appearance that developers were unable to agree on change.   One other digital currency system which is attracting bright young minds is Ethereum, created in 2013 by Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. It works with the “benevolent dictator model”, as Sirer calls it, with Buterin holding the decision-making power.  “Over the last couple of years it’s become apparent that having a static protocol is just not a viable approach,” Buterin told the Consensus bitcoin conference in New York earlier in the week. “Software has to evolve ... and there has to be some mechanism for agreeing on how software is going to upgrade.”   Most, however, reckon that even if Nakamoto were to be found, the other developers - many of whom have written more code than he ever did in the seven years since bitcoin was launched - would not accept his having ultimate power.   “(Nakamoto) would be thanked for creating this amazing thing, but if there comes a time when there’s a technical debate over whether we should go one way or the other, his opinions would only be persuasive, not controlling,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center.

505,U.S. authorities seize accounts of major Bitcoin operator,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0DY0W120130517,"May 17, 2013 12:31pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"ST. LOUIS, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Accelus) - U.S. authorities have seized two accounts linked to a major operator in the booming Bitcoin digital currency market, Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox. The move may prevent the firm from facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoins in U.S. dollars at a time when use of the currency and its value has mushroomed.  Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system.  The price of the volatile currency ballooned in March as a result of the Cyprus bank crisis. Authorities worry that a lack of regulation has left the currency vulnerable to money launderers and other criminals.  A seizure warrant obtained Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security froze an account that an Iowa-based online payment processor, Dwolla Inc, held at Veridian Credit Union in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC.  An affidavit filed by an agent with the department’s investigations unit states that Mutum Sigillum, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, in violation of federal law.  Treasury’s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in March issued guidance that dubbed digital currency exchanges money transmitters, a finding that obliged such businesses to register with FinCEN and obtain any mandated state licenses.  A search of FinCEN’s online registration database Friday morning suggested that neither Mt. Gox nor Mutum Sigillum had registered. The affidavit cited Mutum Sigillum’s failure to register with FinCEN as sufficient grounds to seize its accounts.  Both Mutum Sigillum and Mt. Gox, which says it handles 80 percent of Bitcoin trading, are owned by Mark Karpeles, the affidavit states. It adds that Karpeles opened an account in Mutum Sigillum’s name at Wells Fargo in May 2011, and that when doing so completed a form in which he said it was not a money transmitter.  Karpeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Dwolla.  The Wells Fargo account was seized earlier this month as part of the same investigation that prompted the seizure of Mutum Sigillum’s Dwolla account at Veridian Credit Union, the affidavit states.  It also notes that those wishing to use U.S. dollars to buy Bitcoins deposited money with Dwolla and directed that it be forwarded to Mt. Gox. When people wanted to cash out, Mt. Gox wired funds from an account at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in Japan to the Wells Fargo account and U.S. dollars were sent to Dwolla.  An Homeland Security department informant based in Maryland engaged in such transactions, the affidavit states, presenting the informant’s Bitcoin exchanges as evidence of Mutum Sigillum’s purported status as a money transfer firm.  The seizure of the Mt. Gox-linked accounts may threaten the exchange’s ability to do business in U.S. dollars. The impact on the overall Bitcoin market is unclear.  Some Mt. Gox customers have already taken to message boards to express concern about their ability to buy Bitcoins with U.S. dollars or liquidate existing investments. One user posting on a Bitcoin question and answer site suggested this problem was a grave one for the currency and Mt. Gox.  “Most of the trading volume is in dollars at Gox if I’m not mistaken, so this might be the death blow for them,” the user’s post stated.  Thomson Reuters’ Compliance Complete reported last month that Karpeles said all of Mt. Gox’s U.S.-dollar activity was accomplished via a Dwolla account.  When Compliance Complete asked at the time whether Mt. Gox had registered with FinCEN in the wake of the March guidance, Karpeles said that it had not, but that it planned to do so. He added that Mt. Gox and Dwolla were “discussing compliance issues on a regular basis.”  A spokeswoman for Homeland Security declined to comment on whether the agency, or any foreign law enforcement agency with which it may be cooperating, plan to seize any other accounts linked to Karpeles, Mt.

508,Australian 'bitcoin founder' quietly bidding for patent empire,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0Z61GM,"June 20, 2016 01:40pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Craig Wright, the Australian who claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin, is attempting to build a large patent portfolio around the digital currency and technology underpinning it, according to associates of his and documents reviewed by Reuters.  Since February, Wright has filed more than 50 patent applications in Britain through Antigua-registered EITC Holdings Ltd, which a source close to the company confirmed was connected to Wright, government records show.  Interviews with sources close to EITC Holdings Ltd, which has two of Wright’s associates as directors, confirmed it was still working on filing patent applications and Britain’s Intellectual Property Office has published another 11 patent applications filed by the company in the past week.  “None of this has stopped,” one person close to the company said. The person declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.  Wright did not respond to requests seeking comment.   The granting of even some of the patents would be significant for banking and other industries that are trying to exploit bitcoin technologies, as well as dozens of start-ups scurrying to build business models based around it.  Financial institutions are expected to spend more than $1 billion this year and next on projects linked to the “blockchain” at the heart of bitcoin, according to a survey by boutique investment bank Magister Advisors.  The blockchain is a public database that by-passes money-based payments by recording all transactions digitally. It forms the core of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by maintaining a decentralized record of all transactions.  Proponents say it has the potential to disrupt financial services by making payments and the settling of securities transactions, in particular, far cheaper.  Patents that Wright has applied for range from a mechanism for paying securely for online content to an operating system for running an “internet of things” on blockchain.      A patent schedule, one of a number of documents relating to the applications shown to Reuters by a person close to the EITC Holdings, outlines plans to apply for about 400 in total.  The London Review of Books (LRB) on Saturday ran an article by novelist and journalist Andrew O’Hagan quoting associates of Wright’s as saying that they were working on filing several hundred patents.  O’Hagan, who has spent extensive time with Wright and others close to him, quoted the associates as saying that Wright’s patents would then be sold “for upwards of a billion dollars”. The article did not explain how this valuation was reached, how far the process of contacting purchasers had gone or whether it was still active.   Nearly all the British filings involve the term “blockchain” or its more generic description, the “distributed ledger”. The patent approval process typically takes several years.  “It looks like he is trying to patent the fundamental building blocks of any blockchain, cryptocurrency, or distributed ledger system,” said Antony Lewis, a consultant on bitcoin issues to whom Reuters showed the patent titles and some of the texts.  Wright, 45, has cut a controversial figure after some media last year identified him as the mysterious “Satoshi Nakamoto”, who distributed a paper and later software that launched bitcoin in early 2009.    Wright failed to persuade a skeptical bitcoin community in May that he was Nakamoto, performing a U-turn on his promise to provide further proof and saying that he lacked the “courage” to put “years of anonymity and hiding behind” him. He has since kept a low profile and declined interviews.  While there is no conclusive proof about his authorship of bitcoin, documents seen by Reuters suggest that Wright has had a deep association with the cashless money system since long before it went live.

511,Fund managers say bitcoin ETF proposals withdrawn due to SEC concern,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EY045,"January 09, 2018 12:05pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two U.S. companies shelved proposals to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing ongoing concerns by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), filings showed on Monday.  Staff at the regulatory agency “expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation” of futures contracts based on the digital asset, according to one of the filings.  The move adds a new hurdle to the bid by Wall Street firms to capitalize on investor interest in cryptocurrencies, and it opens a rare public divergence between two financial regulatory agencies over how to regulate them.  Trusts controlled by Rafferty Asset Management LLC and Exchange Traded Concepts LLC each canceled plans to launch three bitcoin funds that could be traded by retail investors as easily as stocks. Neither firm could be reached for comment.  Fund managers thought the proposals had a chance at winning approval given the launch last month of futures contracts based on bitcoin on both the CME and the CBOE exchanges.  Regulators have been scrambling to figure out how to deal with this relatively new asset, and no single one has control.  The SEC has dominion over funds, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) governs futures contracts. The CFTC  has been under pressure to address concerns it did not fully assess the potential risks that bitcoin poses to the financial system.  Bitcoin is a virtual asset that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. Trading has been expensive, difficult and fraught with wild price swings.  The SEC’s decisions also face close scrutiny given its power to clear the way for products that could be among the more volatile traded in U.S. equity markets.   The SEC and the CFTC could not immediately be reached for comment.  One of the ETFs being proposed would be designed to rise or fall in price twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day. Over the last two years alone, bitcoin has gained or lost more than 10 percent on a single day 26 different times, according to data from the Bitstamp exchange.  Bitcoin’s price was little changed at about $15,000 Monday evening on the Bitstamp exchange.

514,"Bitcoin has a governance problem, no matter who created it",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XX1WU,"May 06, 2016 02:04pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - As one would-be father of bitcoin falls by the wayside, squabbling among the web-based currency’s lead developers is exposing a fundamental flaw: it must evolve to meet growing demand, but may lack a governance structure to achieve this.  The latest bickering erupted after Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright promised to prove he was the mysterious creator of bitcoin - which allows users to move money across the world quickly and anonymously - but then said on Thursday he could not provide further evidence to back this up.  Wright stopped short of reneging on his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who launched the digital cryptocurrency in 2009. However, he apologized for damaging the reputations of bitcoin experts who had believed him.  Many members of the bitcoin community reckon this is all a distraction and agree with Wright when he said that the identity of Nakamoto “doesn’t, and shouldn’t, matter”.  “Satoshi’s biggest achievement was to create a system that doesn’t require his participation to run,” said Peter Todd, one of bitcoin’s core software developers. “That’s what makes all this stuff kind of funny. It’s like searching for the creator of a system that’s designed not to require a creator.”  While gray-suited central bankers print conventional currencies and commercial banks control transactions in them,  no one person or entity is in charge of bitcoin. Instead it runs on a decentralized system of shared trust without any third-party verification of transactions - one reason why many people are attracted to it.   Critics, however, say it needs a “benevolent dictator” or at least some “adults” to manage the expansion that it needs to cope with the increasing number of transactions. Someone, or some group, must decide how to meet users’ requirements, they say.  Trades are handled by thousands of “mining” computers around the world which validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes.  The first computer to solve the puzzle clears the transaction and is currently rewarded with 25 new bitcoins, now worth around $11,250. BTC=BTSP. This is how the computers' owners cover their costs - largely power bills - and make a profit. The system also ensures there is no single point in the system that might fail.   In practice, there do appear to be people who can make decisions, but it is also possible to be excluded from this magic circle.  One of the bitcoin experts who initially believed Wright’s claim is Gavin Andresen. Nakamoto handed control of bitcoin’s software to Andresen when he stepped aside in 2011, a transfer that kept the creator’s identity a mystery as it was conducted in cyberspace without human contact.  Andresen later shared that control with others. But when he stated publicly he believed Wright, skeptical developers responded by revoking his “commit access” to a shared repository of bitcoin rules.  Initially, these developers justified their move on security grounds, saying his computer must have been hacked - something  Andresen denied. When Reuters asked Todd whether Andresen’s access would be reinstated, he responded: “Heck no”, saying a belief in Wright amounted to “inexcusable incompetence”.  Andresen admitted to bewilderment over whether he still believed Wright’s claims. “Ask me in six months; I don’t trust my own judgment right now after all the drama,” he said on Twitter.  The squabbling is not new. One of the lead developers, Mike Hearn, stood down from bitcoin in January because of a power struggle nicknamed the “bitcoin civil war”.  Hearn and Andresen had proposed increasing the size of the blocks in which transactions are processed but the other developers opposed this. In quitting, Hearn said that “what was meant to be a new, decentralized form of money that lacked systemically important institutions” had now become “a system completely controlled by just a handful of people”.  Many investors and start-up firms remain optimistic about bitcoin and are making money from it. But Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University, said the appearance of internal conflict was undermining it.  “For bitcoin to retain its value, it’s important to have hope that there’s good management in charge, that there are adults in charge,” Sirer said. “When we see opportunistic moves, that’s a problem.”  But Sirer also said that any open-source project such as bitcoin, which runs using software that anyone can access, change, and distribute, faces the challenge of governance.   “Is it a pipe dream to expect to be able to build a currency system that is completely decentralized and free of any control whatsoever? The short answer to that is yes, but that’s not what anyone should have expected anyway,” he said.   Sirer added that he was concerned that his brightest young students at Cornell were being deterred from getting involved with bitcoin because of the in-fighting and the appearance that developers were unable to agree on change.   One other digital currency system which is attracting bright young minds is Ethereum, created in 2013 by Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. It works with the “benevolent dictator model”, as Sirer calls it, with Buterin holding the decision-making power.  “Over the last couple of years it’s become apparent that having a static protocol is just not a viable approach,” Buterin told the Consensus bitcoin conference in New York earlier in the week. “Software has to evolve ... and there has to be some mechanism for agreeing on how software is going to upgrade.”   Most, however, reckon that even if Nakamoto were to be found, the other developers - many of whom have written more code than he ever did in the seven years since bitcoin was launched - would not accept his having ultimate power.   “(Nakamoto) would be thanked for creating this amazing thing, but if there comes a time when there’s a technical debate over whether we should go one way or the other, his opinions would only be persuasive, not controlling,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center.

The firm, founded in 2013, released a new version of its mobile payment service on Tuesday.  The BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services is based on the first set of U.S. state guidelines for companies that operate in virtual currencies such as bitcoin, which is created and exchanged independent of banks.  The guidelines, issued in June, are aimed at protecting consumers, preventing money laundering and boosting cyber-security.  Circle uses bitcoin blockchain technology to allow consumers to send and transmit dollars, President and co-founder Sean Neville said in an interview. “We think of ourselves as a consumer finance company. We see bitcoin as an enabling technology.”  Circle still relies on banks, and partners with Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, he noted.  The firm has obtained or is seeking money transmitter licenses in other states as well.  Existing virtual currency firms that operate in New York have until August 10 to apply for a BitLicense. To date, the New York Department of Financial Services said it has received 25 applications, which it will continue to evaluate for approval.  The license puts in place “rules of the road that help protect consumers from loss or theft and root out illicit activity,” Anthony Albanese, the regulator’s acting superintendent, said in a statement on Tuesday.  Circle is backed by $76 million in venture capital from Goldman Sachs and other investors, according to its website.

517,Bitcoin 'creator' races to patent technology with gambling tycoon,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GF0H2,"March 02, 2017 07:25am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The man who last year made global headlines by claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, is working with a fugitive online gambling entrepreneur to file scores of patents relating to the digital currency and its underlying technology, blockchain.  Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who made the Satoshi claim, has the backing of Calvin Ayre, a wealthy Canadian entrepreneur, according to people close to Wright and documents reviewed by Reuters. Ayre has been indicted in the United States on charges of running online gambling operations that are illegal in many U.S. states – an accusation he rejects.  Wright’s expertise combined with Ayre’s support make a potentially formidable force in shaping the future of bitcoin and blockchain, the ledger technology that underlies digital currencies.  Wright and his associates have lodged more than 70 patent applications in Britain and have plans to file many more, according to documents and emails reviewed by Reuters and sources with knowledge of Wright’s business. The patents range from the storage of medical documents to WiFi security, and reflect Wright’s deep knowledge of how bitcoin and blockchain work.  Their total compares with 63 blockchain-related patents filed globally last year and 27 so far this year by multinationals from credit card companies to chipmakers, according to Thomson Innovation.  Neither Wright nor Ayre would comment for this story on their business relationship, details of which are revealed here for the first time, or their goals. But their interest in bitcoin and blockchain highlights two key trends.  First, an increasing number of entrepreneurs believe blockchain, which can circumvent the need for big financial intermediaries, will challenge traditional payment systems. Various banks are investing large sums to explore how blockchain could revolutionise payment systems and cut costs.  Bitcoin involves sending payments directly, securely and potentially anonymously between two people’s digital wallets, whereas all mainstream transactions, including those using intermediaries like Paypal and credit card lenders, run through banks and usually require named accounts and verification.  Second, blockchain has the potential to defy authorities trying to enforce borders and national regulations – and it already does so in areas such as online gambling. In internet chatrooms some online gamblers say that using bitcoin enables them to disguise their identity and transactions.  The confidentiality conveyed by the currency is one source of its popularity. Bitcoin hit a record high this week, partly because of speculation that the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund is set to receive U.S. regulatory approval. After a sharp rise this year, the cryptocurrency reached more than $1,200 per bitcoin.  Ayre said last year that he saw a “growing convergence” of bitcoin and online gambling, according to the website CalvinAyre.com. Documents reviewed by Reuters show Wright’s links to online gambling go back decades and that bitcoin grew out of code originally developed with gambling in mind. Early bitcoin code, seen by Reuters and analysed by a computer coding consultant with no ties to Wright or any blockchain-related project, contains unimplemented functions related to poker.  Wright’s vision for bitcoin, though, goes much further than gambling, according to his research papers and interview transcripts. It remains unclear whether he is Satoshi Nakamoto or not, and even whether Satoshi is one person or a group of people. But some of the documents, including two folders of computer code for early versions of bitcoin, support Wright’s claims that he was closely involved in the development of the cryptocurrency before it became public in 2009.  Whatever Wright’s original role, he has suggested bitcoin could have widespread applications. In a paper from November 2015, also reviewed by Reuters, he wrote: “The bitcoin blockchain can be scaled up to replace all existing payment system networks to become the world’s single global economic infrastructure.”  The paper is unpublished, but it gives an insight into the global scope of his plans for the technology. While it’s far from clear the two will be successful in their patent applications, bitcoin and patent experts say Wright’s project represents the single largest filing of bitcoin-related intellectual property they’ve seen. “It’s certainly bullish,” said Justin Hill, a patents expert with law firm Olswang. “With the ambition comes the risk.”  Reuters has previously reported that Wright was filing patents through a company called EITC Holdings, which is based in Antigua.  Ayre lives in Antigua, and EITC Holdings is headed by associates of Ayre, according to one source close to Wright and one with direct knowledge of his business, as well as corporate documents reviewed by Reuters.  Australian Stefan Matthews, who began working for Ayre in 2011, was a director of EITC Holdings until at least late 2016. It isn’t clear if he’s still associated with the company. Canadian Robert MacGregor, another long-term Ayre associate, was a director of EITC Holdings until mid-April 2016. The documents do not disclose the shareholders of the company.  Matthews and MacGregor appear with Wright in a June 2015 photograph seen by Reuters. Neither man responded to requests for comment. Sources familiar with the company said they had gone to some lengths to avoid their roles in EITC being discovered.  In September, Ayre posted on his Facebook page that Wright was his “crazy/smart friend.” Photos on Ayre’s Facebook page show him and Wright boating and swimming together in what Ayre identifies as Indian Arm, a fjord near Vancouver, the previous month. A spokesman for Ayre, Ed Pownall, said Ayre was living in Antigua while trying to clear his name and was not doing “any interviews at the moment, on legal advice.” Pownall added that Ayre “wanted you to know the information about him is incorrect.” He declined to specify what information he was referring to.  The range of patent applications lodged by Wright and colleagues is wide. Five, registered on Dec. 14, were made by EITC Holdings with the bland description “computer-implemented method and system,” public filings show. One, registered on Dec. 28, was described as “Determining a common secret for two blockchain nodes for the secure exchange of information” - apparently a way to use the blockchain to exchange encrypted data. Other applications by Wright and his associates relate to sports betting and a blockchain-based operating system for simple electronic devices.  Emails from Wright to Ayre’s associate Matthews, reviewed by Reuters, set out plans to file 150 patents. A person with direct knowledge of Wright’s businesses said he and associates ultimately aim to file closer to 400. None has been approved so far and it’s not clear whether the patents would be enforceable if granted, but Wright’s associates have been quoted as saying the patents could be sold “for upwards of a billion dollars.”  They face stiff competition from other players who are spending significant sums to explore blockchain’s potential. About 70 banks (and Thomson Reuters) have joined a company called R3, which is examining whether blockchain could cut costs in the way financial markets execute transactions. A spokesperson for R3 did not respond to requests for comment.  PwC, a consultancy, said more than $1.5 billion was invested in blockchain companies in 2016.  Whoever wins this intellectual property race, the rush to patent applications poses a threat to the original conception of bitcoin as a technology available to all.  “What was started by Satoshi as an open source project is going to be far from an open project by the time all the commercial projects weigh in,” said Nigel Swycher, CEO of London-based Aistemos, an IP analytics company. “People will try to use patents as one of many ways to protect their interests.”  Details about Wright’s links to the online gambling industry have emerged from previously unpublished information from the Australian Tax Office (ATO), which is investigating Wright over his claims for tax credits relating to bitcoin ventures. In 2014 Wright told the ATO that he had been producing software for online casinos and other gambling businesses when he was writing computer code that later helped to develop bitcoin.  A 2015 video, reviewed by Reuters, shows Wright being interviewed by three ATO officials. Wright is clad in a waistcoat and tie, fielding questions about his complex businesses and claims for tax breaks. At one point he is quizzed about his work for Bodog, the online gambling network set up by Ayre. Wright clams up and says he cannot disclose any details because of “contractual obligations.”  The ATO declined to comment on Wright, saying that its investigation into him was continuing.  A person close to Wright told Reuters that Wright began working for Bodog in 2010. Ayre had set up Bodog in the 1990s. It expanded into entertainment and proved so lucrative that Ayre featured in the 2006 “billionaires” issue of Forbes magazine.  Ayre chose to base his gambling business in Costa Rica. But much of its revenue came from players in the United States, where online gambling was and is illegal in many states. In February 2012, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland indicted Bodog, Ayre and four other people (Wright not among them) for allegedly conducting an illegal gambling business between 2005 and 2012. They were also indicted for moving funds from overseas to pay winnings to gamblers in the United States.  The Maryland attorney’s office said the case was “still pending.”  Wright’s involvement with bitcoin was initially lucrative. He worked on computer code with an American cybersecurity consultant named David Kleiman, and by 2011 the pair had amassed 1.1 million bitcoins, worth more than $1 billion at today’s prices. Their activities were described by Wright in his interviews with the ATO, of which Reuters has reviewed the transcripts. Kleiman died in 2013.  Wright lost money when an online currency exchange ran into difficulties, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Wright left Australia and relocated his business ventures to Britain.  In 2015, associates of Ayre began setting up companies which are now involved with Wright and bitcoin and blockchain. In September 2015, EITC Holdings, the Antiguan company that has filed scores of patents, was incorporated, originally under the name NCrypt Holdings.  That month, two companies - The Workshop Technologies and The Workshop Ventures - were incorporated in Britain with Ayre’s associate MacGregor as their sole director. According to the person with direct knowledge of the patent filings, Wright now works for The Workshop Technologies and MacGregor is his boss. The Workshop Technologies did not respond to requests for comment.  In May 2016, MacGregor presented Wright to the world as the creator of bitcoin through a coordinated media campaign with the BBC, the Economist and GQ magazine. However, when the cameras rolled, Wright failed to convince experts he really was Satoshi - and the bitcoin world dismissed him as a crank.  The publicity misfire led people with knowledge of Wright to speculate at the time that he would stop making bitcoin and blockchain patent applications. Wright did drop from public view. But he continued to produce papers, handwritten notes and voice recordings about patent applications, many of which have been reviewed by Reuters, for colleagues at The Workshop Technologies to convert into patents, according to the person with direct knowledge of Wright’s businesses.  In September last year, a relaxed-looking Wright resumed making visits to the company’s premises in central London, according to the source, who saw him there several times.  In Antigua, meanwhile, Ayre began construction in October of a $25 million call centre, saying it was part of his vision for bitcoin and online gaming. Speech notes provided by Ayre’s spokesman, Pownall, show that Ayre said at a launch event: “I see a growing convergence of Bitcoin, online gaming, virtual reality and gamification technologies, and progressive countries like Antigua are poised to take advantage of this convergence by developing a truly global services industry.”  According to an overview document and presentation slides reviewed by Reuters, in 2015 Wright planned to propose to the Antigua government that the island adopt bitcoin as its official currency. It is unclear which government department Wright approached, or indeed whether he made the proposal as planned. Requests for comment from three ministries in the Antiguan government produced no response.  “Bitcoin is not just a currency,” Wright wrote in his proposal for Antigua to adopt bitcoin. “It’s a new backbone and commercial foundation for the internet.”",0.06565054945054946,0.031496023817452395
518,U.S. Treasury cautions Bitcoin businesses on legal duties,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9BG1DC20131218,"December 18, 2013 02:21am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department’s anti money-laundering unit is warning businesses linked to the digital currency Bitcoin that they may have to comply with federal law and regulation as money transmitters, a Treasury spokesman said.  Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has sent “industry outreach” letters to about a dozen firms, regarding potential anti-money laundering compliance obligations related to Bitcoin businesses, FinCEN spokesman Steve Hudak told Thomson Reuters’ regulatory information service Compliance Complete.  Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system. It has also raised concerns among law-enforcement authorities that digital currencies could be used for laundering money.  The letters have had a “chilling effect” on Bitcoin businesses, which are intimidated by the threat of civil and criminal sanctions for non-compliance, said Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group. The firms, he said, may effectively be “put out of business in an extrajudicial manner.”  Brad Jacobsen, a lawyer representing one Bitcoin businessman who received a letter from FinCEN, said his client has chosen to suspend his business activity “while state and federal compliance matters are considered and/or appropriate exemptions are determined.”  FinCEN’s letters, which ask recipients for more information about their business models, put the firms on notice that there is a legal “gray area,” so they are “better off to err on the side of caution” and comply with FinCEN’s rules, Matonis said.  Certain Bitcoin businesses came under FinCEN regulation in March when the Treasury bureau issued guidance defining some players in the digital currency industry as money transmitters.  For more than a decade the money-transmission industry, which includes firms such as Western Union and PayPal, has been required to enact anti-money laundering controls, report suspicious activity, register with FinCEN and obtain state licenses.  These steps are required to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the main anti-money laundering statute, and avoid running afoul of a federal law that bans unlicensed money transmitters.  While some Bitcoin businesses reject FinCEN’s assertion that they are money transmitters, a number have still registered with the agency, a search of the Treasury bureau’s website shows.  FinCEN sent letters to Bitcoin-related businesses on the Internet that appeared to fall under its definition of money transmitters but had not registered, Hudak said. He said FinCEN will keep sending letters to unregistered Bitcoin businesses.  “As we come across them, and as people tip us off, we’ll make inquiries. That is part of what we do,” Hudak said.  Mike Caldwell, who runs a business out of his Utah home that accepts digital bitcoins from customers and turns them into metal coins that hold the “private key” needed to redeem the currency, received one of FinCEN’s letters, as first reported by the online publication Wired.  Jacobsen, Caldwell’s lawyer, told Compliance Complete that “out of an abundance of caution” Caldwell’s business, Casascius LLC, reacted to the letter by registering with FinCEN and suspending business activity.  “Laws and regulations related to virtual currencies are in a state of flux and we are working to determine how to appropriately comply with any that are applicable to our client. Casascius LLC is committed to furthering the use and acceptance of Bitcoins but is also committed to complying with applicable law,” Jacobsen said.  The identities of the other recipients of FinCEN’s letters are not known.  A legal expert with years of experience representing digital currency firms said FinCEN seemed to be establishing a new regulatory enforcement precedent by warning individual businesses of compliance obligations before taking action.  “Is this setting a new standard that in the future if there are any questionable business models there will be notice given before any action is taken?” said Carol Van Cleef, a partner with the Washington law firm Patton Boggs LLP.  In response, Hudak said the letters are an attempt at gathering information. He likened them to the letters that banks sometimes send to customers seeking information about the customer’s transactions in an effort to determine whether suspect transactions are truly linked to illicit activity.

520,Old hands in South Korea Bitcoin market unfazed by threats of ban,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F70F9,"January 18, 2018 11:38am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SEOUL/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Threats of a potential cryptocurrency trading ban in South Korea have scared many investors away, but some veterans of the young market are defiant, saying restrictions would be relatively easy to circumvent.  Although the cryptocurrency market lost about $200 billion this week, or a third of its value, these investors - known within the community as “hodlers” after a misspelled meme that went viral during Bitcoin’s early days - are used to rollercoaster rides.  China's shutdown of local exchanges in September, for instance, caused a 50 percent drop in Bitcoin, but prices rebounded eight-fold to almost $20,000. Currently valued around $10,000, Bitcoin BTC=BTSP could be poised for a similar whirlwind this time around, some say.  “In case the government shuts down all local exchanges, investors can always go abroad and open an account there,” said a South Korean student who declined to be named because of legal risks. “I can ask my friends who study abroad or travel there myself. It’s not that big of a problem.”  Cryptocurrency experts say the student probably has good reason to be relaxed. A ban could discourage new market entrants, but the anonymity of buyers and sellers and the ability to move digital assets anywhere in the world with a click makes it hard to impose restrictions on existing participants without a global consensus.  Places like Singapore and Hong Kong maintain light regulations, while neighboring Japan has encouraged a vast ecosystem of companies and investors around digital assets by pioneering a set of rules for the industry. Germany has said national restrictions may be useless.  VPNs, OFFLINE WALLETS  According to industry experts, the first step to circumventing a ban is hiding IP addresses from authorities via virtual private networks (VPNs).  Traders can then continue business as usual. Decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift or Stellar Dex, do not require identification and can be accessed from anywhere.   Cryptocurrency wallets such as Exodus and Jaxx are linked to such exchanges, so trading and storing the assets can still be anonymous. Authorities in countries with strong legal protections may need a warrant to check computers or smartphones for proof of such activity.  Even then, unless caught in the act, the holder can claim no trading has taken place since the legislation was approved and has forgotten the password for the wallet.      Some decentralized exchanges offer derivative products that allow betting on the price of a cryptocurrency against a fiat currency, including the Korean won and Chinese yuan. But  cashing out in fiat is not possible on such exchanges.       An option in that case is to trade all cryptocurrencies for a top one such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, and sell it at one the 2,064 crypto ATMs in 61 countries, although the transaction fees can exceed 10 percent. If need be, coins can be stored on offline “wallets” the size of a USB stick.  Alternatively, holders can open bank accounts in countries that have not banned Bitcoin, then join a local centralized exchange where they can trade cryptocurrencies for fiat.      “I hold everything in a hard wallet the size of my thumb. I have copies of my private keys in a safe. I have accounts on four exchanges on three continents. If any government wants my money, good luck to them,” said a Hong Kong-based investor who claims to hold “about $1 million” in various cryptocurrencies.  A 30-year-old nurse in Seoul said she had already switched to Hong Kong-based exchange Binance before the government’s warnings hit the market. Company officers at Seoul-based exchanges say, anecdotally, such moves have accelerated.  “All this could lead to serious money outflow and only the government is not aware of it,” one officer said, requesting anonymity.  South Korea accounts for between 5 and 15 percent of daily Bitcoin trading. The value of all Bitcoins is around $200 billion.  If opening accounts overseas proves difficult, friends, family or the local Bitcoin community can help. Another option is to find someone with access to an exchange - preferably using encrypted social media apps such as Whatsapp or Telegram - and sell to them at a discount. But fraud is a risk.  “There could be a black market where people who can cash out offshore can pay you in won for your Bitcoins,” said Aurelian Menant, chief executive of Hong-Kong based exchange Gatecoin.  But that leaves the door open to “dodgy stuff,” Menant said, adding that the fear of scams in the aftermath of a ban may deter new investors, potentially shrinking Korean trading volumes “from billions to millions.”  Reporting by Dahee Kim in SEOUL and Marius Zaharia in HONG KONG; Writing by Marius Zaharia",0.08486470588235295,0.019884506833036244

524,Bitcoin 'creator' races to patent technology with gambling tycoon,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GF0H2,"March 02, 2017 07:25am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The man who last year made global headlines by claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, is working with a fugitive online gambling entrepreneur to file scores of patents relating to the digital currency and its underlying technology, blockchain.  Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who made the Satoshi claim, has the backing of Calvin Ayre, a wealthy Canadian entrepreneur, according to people close to Wright and documents reviewed by Reuters. Ayre has been indicted in the United States on charges of running online gambling operations that are illegal in many U.S. states – an accusation he rejects.  Wright’s expertise combined with Ayre’s support make a potentially formidable force in shaping the future of bitcoin and blockchain, the ledger technology that underlies digital currencies.  Wright and his associates have lodged more than 70 patent applications in Britain and have plans to file many more, according to documents and emails reviewed by Reuters and sources with knowledge of Wright’s business. The patents range from the storage of medical documents to WiFi security, and reflect Wright’s deep knowledge of how bitcoin and blockchain work.  Their total compares with 63 blockchain-related patents filed globally last year and 27 so far this year by multinationals from credit card companies to chipmakers, according to Thomson Innovation.  Neither Wright nor Ayre would comment for this story on their business relationship, details of which are revealed here for the first time, or their goals. But their interest in bitcoin and blockchain highlights two key trends.  First, an increasing number of entrepreneurs believe blockchain, which can circumvent the need for big financial intermediaries, will challenge traditional payment systems. Various banks are investing large sums to explore how blockchain could revolutionise payment systems and cut costs.  Bitcoin involves sending payments directly, securely and potentially anonymously between two people’s digital wallets, whereas all mainstream transactions, including those using intermediaries like Paypal and credit card lenders, run through banks and usually require named accounts and verification.  Second, blockchain has the potential to defy authorities trying to enforce borders and national regulations – and it already does so in areas such as online gambling. In internet chatrooms some online gamblers say that using bitcoin enables them to disguise their identity and transactions.  The confidentiality conveyed by the currency is one source of its popularity. Bitcoin hit a record high this week, partly because of speculation that the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund is set to receive U.S. regulatory approval. After a sharp rise this year, the cryptocurrency reached more than $1,200 per bitcoin.  Ayre said last year that he saw a “growing convergence” of bitcoin and online gambling, according to the website CalvinAyre.com. Documents reviewed by Reuters show Wright’s links to online gambling go back decades and that bitcoin grew out of code originally developed with gambling in mind. Early bitcoin code, seen by Reuters and analysed by a computer coding consultant with no ties to Wright or any blockchain-related project, contains unimplemented functions related to poker.  Wright’s vision for bitcoin, though, goes much further than gambling, according to his research papers and interview transcripts. It remains unclear whether he is Satoshi Nakamoto or not, and even whether Satoshi is one person or a group of people. But some of the documents, including two folders of computer code for early versions of bitcoin, support Wright’s claims that he was closely involved in the development of the cryptocurrency before it became public in 2009.  Whatever Wright’s original role, he has suggested bitcoin could have widespread applications. In a paper from November 2015, also reviewed by Reuters, he wrote: “The bitcoin blockchain can be scaled up to replace all existing payment system networks to become the world’s single global economic infrastructure.”  The paper is unpublished, but it gives an insight into the global scope of his plans for the technology. While it’s far from clear the two will be successful in their patent applications, bitcoin and patent experts say Wright’s project represents the single largest filing of bitcoin-related intellectual property they’ve seen. “It’s certainly bullish,” said Justin Hill, a patents expert with law firm Olswang. “With the ambition comes the risk.”  Reuters has previously reported that Wright was filing patents through a company called EITC Holdings, which is based in Antigua.  Ayre lives in Antigua, and EITC Holdings is headed by associates of Ayre, according to one source close to Wright and one with direct knowledge of his business, as well as corporate documents reviewed by Reuters.  Australian Stefan Matthews, who began working for Ayre in 2011, was a director of EITC Holdings until at least late 2016. It isn’t clear if he’s still associated with the company. Canadian Robert MacGregor, another long-term Ayre associate, was a director of EITC Holdings until mid-April 2016. The documents do not disclose the shareholders of the company.  Matthews and MacGregor appear with Wright in a June 2015 photograph seen by Reuters. Neither man responded to requests for comment. Sources familiar with the company said they had gone to some lengths to avoid their roles in EITC being discovered.  In September, Ayre posted on his Facebook page that Wright was his “crazy/smart friend.” Photos on Ayre’s Facebook page show him and Wright boating and swimming together in what Ayre identifies as Indian Arm, a fjord near Vancouver, the previous month. A spokesman for Ayre, Ed Pownall, said Ayre was living in Antigua while trying to clear his name and was not doing “any interviews at the moment, on legal advice.” Pownall added that Ayre “wanted you to know the information about him is incorrect.” He declined to specify what information he was referring to.  The range of patent applications lodged by Wright and colleagues is wide. Five, registered on Dec. 14, were made by EITC Holdings with the bland description “computer-implemented method and system,” public filings show. One, registered on Dec. 28, was described as “Determining a common secret for two blockchain nodes for the secure exchange of information” - apparently a way to use the blockchain to exchange encrypted data. Other applications by Wright and his associates relate to sports betting and a blockchain-based operating system for simple electronic devices.  Emails from Wright to Ayre’s associate Matthews, reviewed by Reuters, set out plans to file 150 patents. A person with direct knowledge of Wright’s businesses said he and associates ultimately aim to file closer to 400. None has been approved so far and it’s not clear whether the patents would be enforceable if granted, but Wright’s associates have been quoted as saying the patents could be sold “for upwards of a billion dollars.”  They face stiff competition from other players who are spending significant sums to explore blockchain’s potential. About 70 banks (and Thomson Reuters) have joined a company called R3, which is examining whether blockchain could cut costs in the way financial markets execute transactions. A spokesperson for R3 did not respond to requests for comment.  PwC, a consultancy, said more than $1.5 billion was invested in blockchain companies in 2016.  Whoever wins this intellectual property race, the rush to patent applications poses a threat to the original conception of bitcoin as a technology available to all.  “What was started by Satoshi as an open source project is going to be far from an open project by the time all the commercial projects weigh in,” said Nigel Swycher, CEO of London-based Aistemos, an IP analytics company. “People will try to use patents as one of many ways to protect their interests.”  Details about Wright’s links to the online gambling industry have emerged from previously unpublished information from the Australian Tax Office (ATO), which is investigating Wright over his claims for tax credits relating to bitcoin ventures. In 2014 Wright told the ATO that he had been producing software for online casinos and other gambling businesses when he was writing computer code that later helped to develop bitcoin.  A 2015 video, reviewed by Reuters, shows Wright being interviewed by three ATO officials. Wright is clad in a waistcoat and tie, fielding questions about his complex businesses and claims for tax breaks. At one point he is quizzed about his work for Bodog, the online gambling network set up by Ayre. Wright clams up and says he cannot disclose any details because of “contractual obligations.”  The ATO declined to comment on Wright, saying that its investigation into him was continuing.  A person close to Wright told Reuters that Wright began working for Bodog in 2010. Ayre had set up Bodog in the 1990s. It expanded into entertainment and proved so lucrative that Ayre featured in the 2006 “billionaires” issue of Forbes magazine.  Ayre chose to base his gambling business in Costa Rica. But much of its revenue came from players in the United States, where online gambling was and is illegal in many states. In February 2012, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland indicted Bodog, Ayre and four other people (Wright not among them) for allegedly conducting an illegal gambling business between 2005 and 2012. They were also indicted for moving funds from overseas to pay winnings to gamblers in the United States.  The Maryland attorney’s office said the case was “still pending.”  Wright’s involvement with bitcoin was initially lucrative.

The publicity misfire led people with knowledge of Wright to speculate at the time that he would stop making bitcoin and blockchain patent applications. Wright did drop from public view. But he continued to produce papers, handwritten notes and voice recordings about patent applications, many of which have been reviewed by Reuters, for colleagues at The Workshop Technologies to convert into patents, according to the person with direct knowledge of Wright’s businesses.  In September last year, a relaxed-looking Wright resumed making visits to the company’s premises in central London, according to the source, who saw him there several times.

The Senate Banking Committee will take testimony from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton in early February, the source said.  Concerns about a bubble in the bitcoin market have heightened since the currency soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December - only to then slump more than 28 percent. On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $14,676, according to prices compiled by the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  The emerging asset class has created a divide among Wall Street and central bankers alike over whether it is a legitimate  and sustainable financial instrument.   The SEC and the CFTC have been increasing their jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding U.S. federal regulator. Both watchdogs have warned of the considerable risks posed by the volatile currency and have said they may not be able to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraudsters.   The CFTC last month allowed CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets Inc to list bitcoin futures contracts, but this month said it would review its process for listing digital currency futures following criticism from market participants.  Five fund managers this week shelved plans to launch exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the SEC regarding the liquidity of the underlying futures market.

The person declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.  Wright did not respond to requests seeking comment.  The granting of even some of the patents would be significant for banking and other industries that are trying to exploit bitcoin technologies, as well as dozens of start-ups scurrying to build business models based around it.  Financial institutions are expected to spend more than $1 billion this year and next on projects linked to the “blockchain” at the heart of bitcoin, according to a survey by boutique investment bank Magister Advisors.  The blockchain is a public database that by-passes money-based payments by recording all transactions digitally. It forms the core of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by maintaining a decentralised record of all transactions.  Proponents say it has the potential to disrupt financial services by making payments and the settling of securities transactions, in particular, far cheaper.  Patents that Wright has applied for range from a mechanism for paying securely for online content to an operating system for running an “internet of things” on blockchain.  A patent schedule, one of a number of documents relating to the applications shown to Reuters by a person close to the EITC Holdings, outlines plans to apply for about 400 in total.  The London Review of Books (LRB) on Saturday ran an article by novelist and journalist Andrew O’Hagan quoting associates of Wright’s as saying that they were working on filing several hundred patents.  O’Hagan, who has spent extensive time with Wright and others close to him, quoted the associates as saying that Wright’s patents would then be sold “for upwards of a billion dollars”. The article did not explain how this valuation was reached, how far the process of contacting purchasers had gone or whether it was still active.  Nearly all the British filings involve the term “blockchain” or its more generic description, the “distributed ledger”. The patent approval process typically takes several years.  “It looks like he is trying to patent the fundamental building blocks of any blockchain, cryptocurrency, or distributed ledger system,” said Antony Lewis, a consultant on bitcoin issues to whom Reuters showed the patent titles and some of the texts.  Wright, 45, has cut a controversial figure after some media last year identified him as the mysterious “Satoshi Nakamoto”, who distributed a paper and later software that launched bitcoin in early 2009.  Wright failed to persuade a sceptical bitcoin community in May that he was Nakamoto, performing a U-turn on his promise to provide further proof and saying that he lacked the “courage” to put “years of anonymity and hiding behind” him. He has since kept a low profile and declined interviews.  While there is no conclusive proof about his authorship of bitcoin, documents seen by Reuters suggest that Wright has had a deep association with the cashless money system since long before it went live.

527,"'Pony' botnet steals bitcoins, digital currencies - Trustwave",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0LP01F20140224,"February 24, 2014 01:29pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"BOSTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Cyber criminals have infected hundreds of thousands of computers with a virus called “Pony” to steal bitcoins and other digital currencies, in the most ambitious cyber attack on virtual money uncovered so far, according to security firm Trustwave.  Trustwave said on Monday that it has found evidence that the operators of a cybercrime ring known as the Pony botnet have stolen some 85 virtual “wallets” that contained bitcoins and other types of digital currencies. The firm said it did not know how much digital currency was contained in the wallets.  “It is the first time we saw such a widespread presence of this type of malware. It was on hundreds of thousands of machines,” said Ziv Mador, security research director with Chicago-based Trustwave.  Trustwave said it believes the crime ring is still operating, though it does not know who is running the group. The company said it has disrupted the servers that were controlling machines infected with Pony, but expects the group to launch more attacks on virtual currency users.  A representative for the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group that promotes adoption of the digital currency, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Trustwave’s discovery comes in the wake of an unrelated cyber attack that spammed bitcoin exchanges earlier this month. That attack prompted at least three online virtual currency traders to halt withdrawals, causing bitcoin’s value to plunge 33 percent over three weeks.  Bitcoin is a digital currency sustained by software code written by an unknown programmer or group of programmers. It is not governed by any one company or person, and its value is determined by user demand.  People who buy digital currency can store it in virtual wallets on their own machines or with companies that offer storage and security services.  Mador said digital currency theft is still in its infancy, but that it is likely to grow.  “If digital currencies become more popular, this type of campaign is likely to get much bigger,” he said.  Digital currency buyers can easily protect themselves from hackers by encrypting digital currency files, Mador said.  “Most websites don’t encrypt them by default, but you can turn them on,” he added.  Botnets are collections of infected computers that take orders from central “command and control” servers. The botnets steal data from compromised PCs and can also deliver other types of malware that force them to perform tasks.  This is at least the third type of fraud to surface involving digital currencies. Criminals have previously hacked into marketplaces where digital currencies are traded by exploiting security flaws in those sites, then stealing those currencies, according to Trustwave. ()  Cyber criminals have also developed botnets that force enslaved computers to create, or “mine”, digital currencies, which the fraudsters then claim as their own.  Bitcoin mining is a time-consuming process in which computers perform complex math calculations. The operators of those botnets are stealing electricity and data center resources when they use compromised machines to mine digital currencies.  Trustwave in December uncovered a trove of some 2 million stolen passwords to websites including Facebook Inc, Google Inc, Twitter Inc and Yahoo Inc  while probing a command and control server using a less sophisticated version of the Pony malware.  Trustwave said on Monday that the new version of Pony compromised another 600,000 website credentials. ",-0.16607777777777777,0.04601758323980546

The dollar value of the Bitcoin has nearly trebled this year and, while its adoption has yet to pick up in a significant way, the rise of this cryptocurrency is worrying central bankers across the world.  But ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio denied it posed a threat to monetary policy and compared its rise to the ‘Tulip mania’ seen three-hundred years ago.  “Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” Constancio said at an ECB conference. “It’s an instrument of speculation ... but certainly not a currency and we don’t see it as a threat to central bank policy.”  The ECB said year last year digital currencies, which are generally issued by private companies and only exist in electronic form, could in principle erode its power over the supply of money, inviting European Union lawmakers to tighten proposed rules on the matter.  Earlier this month, President Mario Draghi quashed an Estonian proposal to launch a government-backed cyrptocurrency, saying the only valid money in the euro zone was the euro.   Last week, Chinese authorities ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to stop trading and immediately notify users of their closure, signaling a widening crackdown by authorities on the industry to contain financial risks.

The European Banking Authority said there was no protection or compensation for people whose “digital wallets” are hacked, a transfer of virtual money goes wrong or a platform is shut.  The warning follows similar announcements from the Bank of France and the Chinese central bank.  The EBA stopped short of telling consumers not to use online currency markets but said if they end up out of pocket there won’t be a safety net like the compensation given to deposit holders when a mainstream EU bank goes bust.  “Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,” EBA said in a statement.  Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. Its value depends on people’s confidence in the currency.  It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but has yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com .  “Cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency, with little prospect of having it returned. Also, when using virtual currency for commercial transactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law,” said the EBA.  The watchdog has been studying virtual currencies for three months and is still considering whether they can or ought to be regulated. It has powers to ban them, though questions remain over how this could be done in practice.  There are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones appearing every week. Bitcoin is by far the best known.  The price of the bitcoin rose above $1,000 last month for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble.  EU regulatory officials doubt such published estimates as the currency and the platforms that trade it are not regulated.  Some platforms have been closed down amid concerns there could be a risk of money laundering, leaving those who held money on them nursing temporary or permanent losses.  The EBA said there could also be potential tax liabilities for users of virtual currencies.",-0.09159444444444445,0.043544121773288445

Bithumb said in a notice on its website on Wednesday that it had stopped all trading after ascertaining “some cryptocurrencies worth about 35 billion won were seized between late yesterday and early morning today.”   The exchange, the sixth busiest in the world according to Coinmarketcap.com, said it had stored “all clients’ assets in safe cold wallets,” which operate on platforms not directly connected to the internet.   It added that the company would fully compensate customers.    The Bithumb theft highlights the security risks and the weak regulation of global cryptocurrency markets. Global policymakers have warned investors to be cautious in trading the digital currency given the lack of broad regulatory oversight.  In Ho, a professor at Korea University’s Blockchain Research Institute, said the stolen coins were most likely to be from the more insecure ‘hot wallets.’  “Since coins in the cold wallets are not at all wired to the internet, it would have been impossible for hackers to steal those in cold wallets unless they physically broke in,” said In, a blockchain expert at the research center.   Bithumb did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments, and its statement did not say whether the stolen coins were stored in its ‘hot wallets’.   Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at ESTsecurity, said digital coins would continue to be juicy targets for hackers around the world.  “No security measures or regulations can 100 percent guarantee safety of virtual coins. It is held anonymously and in lightly-secured systems, which makes them an irresistible target,” Mun said.   On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down 1.8 percent at $6,612.92 by 0351 GMT, extending losses as a series of intrusions on cryptocurrency exchanges in recent weeks sparked  concerns over security.   It has fallen roughly 70 percent from its all-time peak hit around mid-December 2017.    On June 11, another South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail said it was hacked. The cyber attacks come after a high-profile theft of over half a billion dollars worth of digital currency at Japan’s exchange Coincheck earlier this year.  In January, South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading to stop cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering and other crimes. But the government said it does not intend to go as far as shutting down domestic exchanges.

535,U.S. authorities seize accounts of major Bitcoin operator,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE94G0LS20130517,"May 17, 2013 12:34pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"ST. LOUIS, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Accelus) - U.S. authorities have seized two accounts linked to a major operator in the booming Bitcoin digital currency market, Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox. The move may prevent the firm from facilitating the purchase and sale of Bitcoins in U.S. dollars at a time when use of the currency and its value has mushroomed.  Bitcoin, which unlike conventional money is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central authority, has grown popular among users who lack faith in the established banking system.  The price of the volatile currency ballooned in March as a result of the Cyprus bank crisis. Authorities worry that a lack of regulation has left the currency vulnerable to money launderers and other criminals.  A seizure warrant obtained Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security froze an account that an Iowa-based online payment processor, Dwolla Inc, held at Veridian Credit Union in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC.  An affidavit filed by an agent with the department’s investigations unit states that Mutum Sigillum, a Mt. Gox subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, in violation of federal law.  Treasury’s anti-money laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in March issued guidance that dubbed digital currency exchanges money transmitters, a finding that obliged such businesses to register with FinCEN and obtain any mandated state licenses.  A search of FinCEN’s online registration database Friday morning suggested that neither Mt. Gox nor Mutum Sigillum had registered. The affidavit cited Mutum Sigillum’s failure to register with FinCEN as sufficient grounds to seize its accounts.  Both Mutum Sigillum and Mt. Gox, which says it handles 80 percent of Bitcoin trading, are owned by Mark Karpeles, the affidavit states. It adds that Karpeles opened an account in Mutum Sigillum’s name at Wells Fargo in May 2011, and that when doing so completed a form in which he said it was not a money transmitter.  Karpeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did Dwolla.  The Wells Fargo account was seized earlier this month as part of the same investigation that prompted the seizure of Mutum Sigillum’s Dwolla account at Veridian Credit Union, the affidavit states.  It also notes that those wishing to use U.S. dollars to buy Bitcoins deposited money with Dwolla and directed that it be forwarded to Mt. Gox. When people wanted to cash out, Mt. Gox wired funds from an account at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank in Japan to the Wells Fargo account and U.S. dollars were sent to Dwolla.  An Homeland Security department informant based in Maryland engaged in such transactions, the affidavit states, presenting the informant’s Bitcoin exchanges as evidence of Mutum Sigillum’s purported status as a money transfer firm.  The seizure of the Mt. Gox-linked accounts may threaten the exchange’s ability to do business in U.S. dollars. The impact on the overall Bitcoin market is unclear.  Some Mt. Gox customers have already taken to message boards to express concern about their ability to buy Bitcoins with U.S. dollars or liquidate existing investments. One user posting on a Bitcoin question and answer site suggested this problem was a grave one for the currency and Mt. Gox.  “Most of the trading volume is in dollars at Gox if I’m not mistaken, so this might be the death blow for them,” the user’s post stated.  Thomson Reuters’ Compliance Complete reported last month that Karpeles said all of Mt. Gox’s U.S.-dollar activity was accomplished via a Dwolla account.  When Compliance Complete asked at the time whether Mt. Gox had registered with FinCEN in the wake of the March guidance, Karpeles said that it had not, but that it planned to do so. He added that Mt. Gox and Dwolla were “discussing compliance issues on a regular basis.”  A spokeswoman for Homeland Security declined to comment on whether the agency, or any foreign law enforcement agency with which it may be cooperating, plan to seize any other accounts linked to Karpeles, Mt. Gox, or other Bitcoin exchanges.  (This article was produced by the Compliance Complete service of Thomson Reuters Accelus.

541,Betting on blockchain: firms seek fortune in bitcoin's plumbing,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0PW1RT20150722,"July 22, 2015 11:17am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - A year ago, bitcoin was widely dismissed as little more than a way for drug-dealers and terrorists to move money around anonymously. Now, some of the world’s biggest banks and companies are buying into the technology behind it.    Underlying the controversial web-based “cryptocurrency” is the blockchain - a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.  But the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions. Any two parties could use it to exchange other information, including stock deals, legal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.  Backers say it could cut out the middleman and help fight corruption, as the process by which the data is secured makes it virtually impossible to tamper with. Banks reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent.  But these are early days - bitcoin was invented just six years ago - and the blockchain is still being experimented with. As is often the case with new technology, as when Apple released the iPad, it is not clear what problem it solves.   Peter Kirby, CEO of Texas blockchain-focused start-up Factom, likened the technology’s stage of development to that of the internet in the early 1990s, when it was seen as little more than a way to send emails.   “Here we are again in the email for the internet era, and everyone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s all about moving money through the world.’ No. It’s about a giant distributed ledger that you can write anything to and never unwrite it.”   Factom is using the blockchain to build a permanent and secure land title record in Honduras, one of the poorest countries in Latin America, where land-grabbing and corruption are rife.    Every 10 minutes, a “block” of bitcoin transactions is verified by thousands of computers, mainly in places where the substantial energy needed to power them is cheap, such as China and Iceland. That block of data is then layered on top of the previous one to form a “chain”.   Because the ledger thus created is shared by all of them, if anyone wants to go back and change any of the data, they would have to change every single copy of it, making the blockchain all but tamper-proof.   That also solves the problem of money being spent more than once, something that has plagued earlier attempts to create digital currencies. This is an advance that makes the blockchain a “key technological innovation”, according to the Bank of England, which has a dedicated team looking into the technology.   In June, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) said it was exploring new ways for shares to be issued and transferred, while Reuters disclosed earlier this year that IBM was looking at creating a digital cash and payment system using the blockchain.  In recent months, major banks such as UBS, Barclays, ING, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have announced ventures into blockchain technology.  The potential for transactions to be settled in minutes, rather than days, with fraud or hacking almost impossible, is drawing banks in. That, and the desire not to be left behind.   “We’d rather disrupt ourselves before somebody else does,” said ING’s global head of transaction services, Mark Buitenhek.    “Our approach ... is just to start doing it, and in a year’s time, we’ll see,” he said. “If it takes off, it takes off, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.”  With banks under increased regulatory scrutiny, the ability to prove via an immutable record that their trillions of dollars of daily transactions have been carried out in clients’ best interests, not just their own, could prove invaluable.  “The spin-offs from bitcoin are limitless,” said Adam Vaziri, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association. “Using the blockchain (will) avoid any manipulation of records.”  Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Giles Elgood",0.12286785714285717,0.027067228406514123
542,EU banking watchdog warns of risks from Bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9BC00820131213,"December 13, 2013 01:51pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - People using Bitcoins are on their own when it comes to losses, the European Union’s banking watchdog said on Friday in a formal warning to consumers on the risks of using unregulated online currencies.  The European Banking Authority said there was no protection or compensation for people whose “digital wallets” are hacked, a transfer of virtual money goes wrong or a platform is shut.  The warning follows similar announcements from the Bank of France and the Chinese central bank.  The EBA stopped short of telling consumers not to use online currency markets but said if they end up out of pocket there won’t be a safety net like the compensation given to deposit holders when a mainstream EU bank goes bust.  “Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,” EBA said in a statement.  Bitcoin is not backed by any central bank or government, or by physical assets. Its value depends on people’s confidence in the currency.  It has been gaining acceptance by the general public and investment community but has yet to become an accepted form of payment on websites of major retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O).  “Cases have been reported of consumers losing significant amounts of virtual currency, with little prospect of having it returned. Also, when using virtual currency for commercial transactions, consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law,” said the EBA.  The watchdog has been studying virtual currencies for three months and is still considering whether they can or ought to be regulated. It has powers to ban them, though questions remain over how this could be done in practice.  There are about 100 virtual currencies, with new ones appearing every week. Bitcoin is by far the best known.  The price of the bitcoin rose above $1,000 last month for the first time, extending a 400 percent surge in less than a month and fuelling concerns of a bubble.  EU regulatory officials doubt such published estimates as the currency and the platforms that trade it are not regulated.  Some platforms have been closed down amid concerns there could be a risk of money laundering, leaving those who held money on them nursing temporary or permanent losses.  The EBA said there could also be potential tax liabilities for users of virtual currencies.  Editing by Tom Pfeiffer",-0.08269473684210527,0.04125232589048379
543,UPDATE 1-U.S. Senate panel to discuss bitcoin with markets regulators -source,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1P601N,"January 10, 2018 08:30pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate’s financial services panel will hold a hearing next month with the country’s top markets regulators to discuss bitcoin amid rising concerns over the risks cryptocurrencies pose to the financial system, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  The Senate Banking Committee will take testimony from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton in early February, the source said.  Concerns about a bubble in the bitcoin market have heightened since the currency soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December - only to then slump more than 28 percent. On Wednesday, bitcoin was trading at $14,676, according to prices compiled by the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.  The emerging asset class has created a divide among Wall Street and central bankers alike over whether it is a legitimate  and sustainable financial instrument.   The SEC and the CFTC have been increasing their jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding U.S. federal regulator. Both watchdogs have warned of the considerable risks posed by the volatile currency and have said they may not be able to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraudsters.   The CFTC last month allowed CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets Inc to list bitcoin futures contracts, but this month said it would review its process for listing digital currency futures following criticism from market participants.  Five fund managers this week shelved plans to launch exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the SEC regarding the liquidity of the underlying futures market.

546,Big money stays away from booming bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1CS0EB,"October 23, 2017 12:10pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin is booming, digital currency hedge funds are sprouting at the rate of two a week and the value of all cryptocurrencies has surged tenfold this year to more than $170 billion.  Yet for all the hype, mainstream institutional investors are steering clear of the nascent market, taking the view that it is too lightly regulated, too volatile and too illiquid to risk investing other people’s money in.  Bitcoin, the biggest and most well-known cryptocurrency, has outperformed all the world’s traditional currencies each year since 2011, except for 2014. But many investors still view it as an opaque, esoteric instrument used by gun-runners and drug-dealers on the Dark Web that should be avoided.  This year, though, a flood of new hedge funds focused on cryptocurrencies has offered institutional investors who might be unfamiliar with the market a potential route into the world of digital currencies.   According to Autonomous NEXT, a financial technology research house, 84 so-called crypto hedge funds have been launched this year, taking the total to 110 with about $2.2 billion in assets altogether.  But the fact most of the funds are relatively small with a limited track record - and that cryptocurrency price swings have been so pronounced - means the world’s pension funds, insurance companies and large mutual funds are staying away.  “While cryptocurrencies are probably here to stay, they are difficult to analyze, wildly volatile and some may be prone to fraud,” said Trevor Greetham at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), part of the Royal London life insurance company.  “Diversification is a good thing but that doesn’t mean investing in everything just because it’s there. We favor assets with a long track record in producing returns or reducing risks,” said Greetham, who heads RLAM’s multi asset team.  For a graphic on top cryptocurrencies, click tmsnrt.rs/2gWgyLc  Autonomous NEXT partner Lex Sokolin said there were probably only a couple of funds worth several hundred million dollars with most in the $5 million to $20 million range - well below the threshold most institutional investors would consider.  “For many institutional, discretionary fund managers, those funds wouldn’t get cleared because the big question would be around liquidity,” said James Butterfill, head of investment strategy at ETF Securities in London.  One way mainstream money managers could get exposure is by investing in a basket of hedge funds that includes a crypto fund. But the head of hedge funds at a major European bank that invests in more than 100 hedge funds said there were no crypto funds in his portfolio.  “It’s a very controversial proposition,” said the banker, who declined to be named. “It’s unlikely that the most established hedge funds will make big bets on this because you could put your core business at risk.”  Determining the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is tricky. There are almost 17 million bitcoins in existence now but the total supply is limited to 21 million, and that won’t be reached until the next century.  Bitcoin’s total value, or market capitalization, is close to $100 billion, bigger than U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley. At the start of the year it was just $15 billion. Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is now worth almost $30 billion.  “If the supply is truly fixed then the price of these securities are determined purely by demand which, in turn, is determined largely by sentiment,” said Ken Dickson, investment director, money markets and FX at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  “This means huge price swings with bubbles, booms and busts. Unless the supply processes of these instruments are reformed then it is unlikely that they will play any part of an investment portfolio,” he said.  Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride this year. After hitting what was then a record high just below $5,000 in early September it lost about a third of its value in less than two weeks. It has since almost doubled in price again, to new highs near $6,000.   Ethereum has been even more erratic. Its price surged almost 50 times from the start of the year to June, before falling back by about a fifth, according to industry website CoinDesk.   That kind of volatility means committees at institutional investment firms looking at the relative risks of asset classes are likely to rule out cryptocurrencies, asset managers said.  “Your risk-budgeting committee will say: you can’t hold a lot of that because of the amount it increases risk in your portfolio,” said Butterfill. “I do expect volatility to decrease over time but risk budget teams tend to look historically.”  For now, those investing in crypto funds are high-net worth individuals, companies managing money for wealthy families, private wealth managers and some venture capital investors.  “It’s clear there’s money piling into these funds,” said Emad Mostaque, co-chief investment officer at the London office of South African hedge fund firm Capricorn Fund Managers. “There’s just not that institutional investor comfort yet.”  Alistair Milne, co-founder of the Mayfair-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, likens investment in crypto funds to the start of the hedge fund boom in the early 1990s, when wealthy individuals were the first to invest in a raft of new funds making high returns.  “It always starts with the high-net worth individuals,” he said. “It wasn’t until 2004-2005 that institutional investors started getting involved in those.”  The new crypto hedge funds take a variety of approaches, betting on new coins issued to raise funds via so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), price direction or differentials between rates on the many cryptocurrency exchanges.   One new fund, the London-based BitSpread, says its $25 million market-neutral fund - which trades on price differentials alone - gives major investors a way into the market without exposing them to violent price swings.   The fund is up 32 percent so far this year, having managed to exploit the kind of arbitrage possible in a young market where large price gaps exist.  “(Institutional investors) haven’t invested in this ecosystem yet because they haven’t yet found the right vehicle,” said Cedric Jeanson, BitSpread’s founder.

The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs in an August 12 letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano also said it had started interviewing people about the risks - and promises - of virtual currencies.  Virtual currencies “can be sent nearly anonymously, leaving little or no trail for regulators or enforcement agencies,” said the letter, which was signed by the committee’s Chairman Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, and ranking member Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican.  “Their near anonymous and decentralized nature has also attracted criminals who value few things more than being allowed to operate in the shadows,” the senators wrote.  Identical letters were sent to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a spokeswoman for the committee said.  The senators had asked these agencies to list any policies or procedures in place to regulate virtual currencies, any information on how they were cooperating with other agencies and any other initiatives in the area.  The Senate committee had been interviewing “individuals inside and outside of government” on the threats and risks related to virtual currencies, the letter added.  The lawmakers’ interest comes among increased scrutiny of virtual currencies, electronic money that can be passed between parties without traditional banking or money transfer systems, of which Bitcoin is the most prominent one.  This week, a memo showed that New York’s top banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky - superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services - is considering issuing guidelines to regulate virtual currencies.  The virtual currency industry has also been the subject of enforcement actions and other attempts to crack down on potential wrongdoing.  In May, U.S. prosecutors filed an indictment against the digital currency exchange Liberty Reserve, accusing the Costa Rica-based company of helping criminals around the world to launder more than $6 billion in illicit funds.  Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchanger of U.S. dollars with Bitcoins, had two accounts held by its U.S. subsidiary seized this year by agents from the Department of Homeland Security on the grounds that it was operating a money transmitting business without a license.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation last year reported Bitcoin was used by criminals to move money around the world, and the U.S. Treasury in March said that digital currency firms were required to stick to anti-money laundering rules.

The man accused of implementing tough regulations on Bitcoins and other online currency now heads a consultancy that is acting as an adviser and media liaison for one of the sector’s major new players.  The Lawsky Group, which provides legal and strategic counsel for clients on financial regulation issues, was the press contact last week for Axoni, a blockchain technology firm.  Axoni was promoting its successful test of blockchain technology into the back office settlement process for derivatives transactions.  “We’ll be doing a broad range of financial consultancy ... and some financial technology public relations,” said Lawsky Group spokesman Matthew Anderson.  Anderson was spokesman for the Department of Financial Services, the state regulator where Lawsky was accused of slowing the development of virtual currencies.  Lawsky said last June he wanted to “put in place guard rails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity without stifling beneficial innovation”.  Though some Bitcoin proponents welcomed the safeguards, Lawsky’s about-face now that he is profiting from the technology in the private sector has miffed more than a few observers.  “I think the most interesting thing about Mr Lawsky’s newest venture is that it highlights the cozy relationship between regulators and the regulated industry,” Pamela Morgan, CEO of Third Key Solutions, told IFR.  Morgan, whose company consults for other companies that use digital currencies such as Bitcoin, called Lawsky’s new role “crony capitalism at its finest”.  Lawsky’s spokesman did not respond to two requests for further detail about his work, though others saw no problem with it.  “I think it is fantastic that he has entered the private sector and continued to support the Bitcoin/blockchain space,” said Adam Draper, CEO of Boost VC, a venture capital firm focused on blockchain and other virtual technologies.  Some suggest the addition of public relations brings out a strength that helped raise Lawsky’s profile in the first place - his ability to interact with the media.

Bitcoin has been buffeted this year by a series of negative headlines centering around increased scrutiny by global regulators. There has also been the incidence of hacks on exchanges, the latest being the theft of roughly $532.9 million in digital money from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck a few weeks ago.   The first digital currency was also affected by the risk-off mood that permeated financial markets since the beginning of the year, undermining views that bitcoin’s price moves are generally uncorrelated to other asset classes. Sentiment on risk assets  such as stocks and bitcoin has since improved.  Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, sees a new record peak for bitcoin by July, based on the currency’s 22 corrections since 2010.   On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin rose as high as $10,234 BTC=BTSP and was last at $10,123.12, up nearly 7 percent on the day.  (Graphic: Bitcoin daily chart - reut.rs/2stJIqQ)  “Bitcoin’s increase has coincided with the rally in global stock markets,” said Miles Eakers, chief market analyst, at FX brokerage Centtrip, adding that a sustained break above $10,000  could open the $12,000 level.  The original cryptocurrency gained more than 1,300 percent last year, capped by a lifetime peak just shy of $20,000 on Dec. 17.  Other digital currencies also rose after posting steep losses the last few weeks. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was up 2.5 percent over the past 24 hours at $933.24, while the third-largest, Ripple, gained 5.3 percent to $1.15, according to cryptocurrency price tracker coinmarketcap.com.  (Graphic: Ethereum, Ripple price chart - reut.rs/2o5jGp5)  Fundstrat’s Lee said bitcoin is still in a bull market phase even after a 70 percent selloff.  “During bull periods, bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the duration of the decline and implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs—this is July 2018,” Lee said.  He added that 2018 will remain a strong year for cryptocurrencies, but he sees the larger and more established blockchain networks such as bitcoin and ethereum dominating again.  As bitcoin recovered, European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch warned in a speech in Paris on Thursday that bitcoin is not a currency, but a speculative digital asset, according to a Market News International report.  He added that because virtual currencies do not have a trusted issuer behind them, “they may become worthless at any time.”   Mersch said he is not surprised that virtual currencies are not widely accepted as a means of payment.

557,Betting on blockchain: firms seek fortune in bitcoin's plumbing,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0XS0PB20150722,"July 22, 2015 11:07am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"* Bitcoin tech seen holding more potential than currency  * Blockchain may be used for share deals, property rights  * Banks see opportunity to cut costs, provide transparency  * Graphic: link.reuters.com/gut53w  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - A year ago, bitcoin was widely dismissed as little more than a way for drug-dealers and terrorists to move money around anonymously. Now, some of the world’s biggest banks and companies are buying into the technology behind it.  Underlying the controversial web-based “cryptocurrency” is the blockchain - a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.  But the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions. Any two parties could use it to exchange other information, including stock deals, legal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.  Backers say it could cut out the middleman and help fight corruption, as the process by which the data is secured makes it virtually impossible to tamper with. Banks reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster, more efficient and more transparent.  But these are early days - bitcoin was invented just six years ago - and the blockchain is still being experimented with. As is often the case with new technology, as when Apple released the iPad, it is not clear what problem it solves.  Peter Kirby, CEO of Texas blockchain-focused start-up Factom, likened the technology’s stage of development to that of the internet in the early 1990s, when it was seen as little more than a way to send emails.  “Here we are again in the email for the internet era, and everyone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s all about moving money through the world.’ No. It’s about a giant distributed ledger that you can write anything to and never unwrite it.”  Factom is using the blockchain to build a permanent and secure land title record in Honduras, one of the poorest countries in Latin America, where land-grabbing and corruption are rife.  Every 10 minutes, a “block” of bitcoin transactions is verified by thousands of computers, mainly in places where the substantial energy needed to power them is cheap, such as China and Iceland. That block of data is then layered on top of the previous one to form a “chain”.  Because the ledger thus created is shared by all of them, if anyone wants to go back and change any of the data, they would have to change every single copy of it, making the blockchain all but tamper-proof.  That also solves the problem of money being spent more than once, something that has plagued earlier attempts to create digital currencies. This is an advance that makes the blockchain a “key technological innovation”, according to the Bank of England, which has a dedicated team looking into the technology.  In June, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq said it was exploring new ways for shares to be issued and transferred, while Reuters disclosed earlier this year that IBM was looking at creating a digital cash and payment system using the blockchain.  In recent months, major banks such as UBS, Barclays, ING, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have announced ventures into blockchain technology.  The potential for transactions to be settled in minutes, rather than days, with fraud or hacking almost impossible, is drawing banks in. That, and the desire not to be left behind.  “We’d rather disrupt ourselves before somebody else does,” said ING’s global head of transaction services, Mark Buitenhek.  “Our approach ... is just to start doing it, and in a year’s time, we’ll see,” he said. “If it takes off, it takes off, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.”  With banks under increased regulatory scrutiny, the ability to prove via an immutable record that their trillions of dollars of daily transactions have been carried out in clients’ best interests, not just their own, could prove invaluable.  “The spin-offs from bitcoin are limitless,” said Adam Vaziri, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association. “Using the blockchain (will) avoid any manipulation of records.”   (Reporting by Jemima Kelly; Editing by Giles Elgood)",0.13461428571428574,0.028778537930323644

It is deadly,” central bank head Lars Rohde said in an interview with state broadcaster DR published online on Monday.  The comments echoed concerns of a bubble about to burst made by other market participants and central bankers after the price of bitcoin rocketed more than 1,800 percent since the start of the year.  Rohde said that if people decide to ignore his warnings, they should realize that they are pretty much on their own.  “It is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual,” said Rohde.  Emphasizing his point, Rohde told investors not to “come and complain to us if it goes wrong”.  The launch of futures trading in bitcoin has further fueled debate about the place of the cryptocurrency in the financial system.  On Sunday, France’s finance minister said his country would propose that the G20 group of major economies discuss regulation of the bitcoin virtual currency next year.  Decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin are still not widely accepted, and critics say that the fact that they are unregulated makes them risky to use.   European Union states and legislators last week agreed stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing on exchange platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  “I see bitcoin as tulipmania, which is a bubble that is out of control,” Rohde said, referring to a notorious 17th century Dutch boom and bust.  Last week, the Danish central bank said that introducing a digital version of the Danish crown currency would pose risks to financial stability without improving payment solutions for Danes.

While bitcoin investors and analysts believe last week’s  decline in its value was a natural correction after a heady run-up in prices, there have been further warnings from market regulators and central banks.  Bitcoin fell nearly 30 percent at one stage on Friday to $11,159.93.

Russian financial authorities initially treated any sort of money issued by non-state approved institutions as illegal but later accepted the globally booming market of crypto-currencies.  “The state understands indeed that crypto-currencies are real. There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them,” Siluanov said.  By the end of this year, the finance ministry will finish working on a law that would define a procedure for buying crypto-currencies, which would also include registration of those willing to buy the virtual money, Siluanov said.  Buying of crypto-currencies should be similar to buying securities, such as treasury bonds for households launched by the finance ministry this year, Siluanov said.  He did not explain what the criteria would be for establishing which crypto-currency transactions would be subject to Russian regulations.  Speaking at a financial forum in central Moscow, Siluanov warned that investments in volatile crypto-currencies are risky and insecure. Previously the Russian central bank said such currencies were used in illegal operations, such as money laundering, and promised to crack down on the instrument.  Bitcoin, the most well-known virtual currency that emerged in mid-2010, is increasingly popular worldwide and in Russia as it promises substantial profits. One bitcoin last traded at around $4,460 BTC=BTSP, up from its initial price of less than $1.   Siluanov said investors should be aware of risks related to virtual currencies. He said his ministry’s task was to  “make investments into such instruments regulated....

563,"Bitcoin blows past $16,000, alarm bells ring louder",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E11YH,"December 08, 2017 04:42pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin rocketed to a lifetime high well above $16,000 on Thursday after climbing some 67 percent over one week, intensifying the debate about whether the cryptocurrency is in a bubble about to burst.  The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange struggled to keep up with record traffic as the price surged, with an upcoming launch of the first bitcoin futures contract further fueling investor interest.   Proponents say bitcoin is a good medium of exchange and a way to store value, much like a precious metal. They also argue it is preferable to traditional currencies because it is not subject to central bank manipulation.  The supply of bitcoin will eventually be capped at 21 million, and some 16.7 million have already been released.   But critics say that the price run-up is a bubble that has been driven mostly by speculation, leaving bitcoin vulnerable to a sharp reversal. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a fraud in September.  “Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset  that remains in uncharted waters, we’ve simply not experienced this before,” said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of deVere Group.   “Also, an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors,” he added.  The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has surged seventeen-fold in value so far this year.   The latest move brought its so-called market cap, its price multiplied by the number of bitcoins in circulation, to nearly $305 billion, according to Coinmarketcap, a trade website. By comparison, the market value of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is around $288 billion.   Analysts said the launch slated for this weekend of bitcoin futures by Cboe Global Markets Inc’s CBOE.O Cboe Futures Exchange, one of the world’s biggest derivatives exchanges, was helping drive up the price on expectations it would draw more investors to the market.  The CME Group will launch bitcoin futures one week later, while Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) plans to get into the mix next year.  It is not clear to what extent big U.S. banks will participate in the new bitcoin-related activity.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will clear bitcoin futures for certain clients when they go live, a spokeswoman said on Thursday.   The bank is “evaluating the specifications and risk attributes for the bitcoin futures contracts as part of our standard due diligence process,” spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said.  Bitcoin climbed as high as $16,615.62 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, up nearly 22 percent on the day. It was last at $16,607.14.  Coinbase, the largest U.S. platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, said on Thursday on Twitter that it had experienced an outage due to record traffic. The venue was last up and running.  Some investors said they still see scope for bitcoin to soar even higher.  “It will hit potentially $20,000 because so much capital is coming in and it’s the most liquid secure coin out there,” said David Drake, founder and chairman of DLJ Capital, a family office in New York.  Other trading venues showed different prices for bitcoin, which trades in more than 100 cryptocurrency exchanges that are not accountable to any central authority. For instance, at institutional trading platform GDAX, bitcoin topped $19,000, while it hit above $16,000 at itBit.  Those price discrepancies could add another level of speculation by introducing the prospect of arbitrage trades between the markets.   For graphic on bitcoin prices: tmsnrt.rs/2AHKJPd  Some warned that the launch of bitcoin futures, which will allow investors to take speculative short positions to bet against the cryptocurrency, as well as long positions, could spark further volatility.   And while Cboe, CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments, the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with exchanges lacking even basic oversight.  The Futures Industry Association, representing some of the world’s largest brokers, sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission saying that more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin’s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the spot market.  “Aggressive traders, such as hedge funds and algorithm-driven funds, (will be able) to use this futures market to enter bitcoin trading with high levels of liquidity for aggressive short-selling and knock the prices really low,” said Think Markets analyst Naeem Aslam.  “Players now have an incentive to be on the short side and make profits hedging against the upside.”  Concerns about cybersecurity could also take the shine off of bitcoin.   Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace NiceHash, which matches people looking to sell processing time on computers in exchange for bitcoin, said on Thursday it had lost about $64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system.  Bitcoin slumped in 2014 when MtGox, then the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, collapsed after saying it had been hacked and had 650,000 bitcoins stolen.   The value of all cryptocurrencies now stands at nearly $430 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.   Bitcoin has more than tripled in price since the start of October, putting it on track for its best quarter since the end of 2013, when it surged above $1,000 for the first time.

On Sunday, Chicago-based derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets CBOE.O launched bitcoin futures, enabling investors to get exposure to the currency via a large, regulated exchange.  The CME Group (CME.O) is expected to launch its futures contract on Dec. 17.  “We’re going to see bitcoin emerge as a payment network,” said Trevor Koverko, chief executive officer of Polymath, a securities token platform.  “Currently bitcoin is being used as a speculative asset and store of value. But as scaling solutions...emerge, bitcoin’s utility dramatically increases along with its price,” Koverko said.  Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency,  was quoted at $17,310 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, up 5.1 percent on the day. Earlier on Tuesday bitcoin hit a record high of $17,428.42, registering a roughly 20-fold increase in its price for the year as it drew in millions of new investors.

569,"UPDATE 4-Bitcoin blows past $16,000, alarm bells ring louder",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1O74OD,"December 07, 2017 07:53pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin rocketed to a lifetime high well above $16,000 on Thursday after climbing some 67 percent over one week, intensifying the debate about whether the cryptocurrency is in a bubble about to burst.  The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange struggled to keep up with record traffic as the price surged, with an upcoming launch of the first bitcoin futures contract further fueling investor interest.   Proponents say bitcoin is a good medium of exchange and a way to store value, much like a precious metal. They also argue it is preferable to traditional currencies because it is not subject to central bank manipulation.  The supply of bitcoin will eventually be capped at 21 million, and some 16.7 million have already been released.   But critics say that the price run-up is a bubble that has been driven mostly by speculation, leaving bitcoin vulnerable to a sharp reversal. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a fraud in September.  “Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset  that remains in uncharted waters, we’ve simply not experienced this before,” said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of deVere Group.   “Also, an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors,” he added.  The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has surged seventeen-fold in value so far this year.   The latest move brought its so-called market cap, its price multiplied by the number of bitcoins in circulation, to nearly $305 billion, according to Coinmarketcap, a trade website. By comparison, the market value of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is around $288 billion.   Analysts said the launch slated for this weekend of bitcoin futures by Cboe Global Markets Inc’s CBOE.O Cboe Futures Exchange, one of the world’s biggest derivatives exchanges, was helping drive up the price on expectations it would draw more investors to the market.  The CME Group will launch bitcoin futures one week later, while Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) plans to get into the mix next year.  It is not clear to what extent big U.S. banks will participate in the new bitcoin-related activity.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will clear bitcoin futures for certain clients when they go live, a spokeswoman said on Thursday.   The bank is “evaluating the specifications and risk attributes for the bitcoin futures contracts as part of our standard due diligence process,” spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said.  Bitcoin climbed as high as $16,615.62 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, up nearly 22 percent on the day. It was last at $16,607.14.  Coinbase, the largest U.S. platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, said on Thursday on Twitter that it had experienced an outage due to record traffic. The venue was last up and running.  Some investors said they still see scope for bitcoin to soar even higher.  “It will hit potentially $20,000 because so much capital is coming in and it’s the most liquid secure coin out there,” said David Drake, founder and chairman of DLJ Capital, a family office in New York.  Other trading venues showed different prices for bitcoin, which trades in more than 100 cryptocurrency exchanges that are not accountable to any central authority. For instance, at institutional trading platform GDAX, bitcoin topped $19,000, while it hit above $16,000 at itBit.  Those price discrepancies could add another level of speculation by introducing the prospect of arbitrage trades between the markets.   For graphic on bitcoin prices: tmsnrt.rs/2AHKJPd  Some warned that the launch of bitcoin futures, which will allow investors to take speculative short positions to bet against the cryptocurrency, as well as long positions, could spark further volatility.   And while Cboe, CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments, the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with exchanges lacking even basic oversight.  The Futures Industry Association, representing some of the world’s largest brokers, sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission saying that more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin’s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the spot market.  “Aggressive traders, such as hedge funds and algorithm-driven funds, (will be able) to use this futures market to enter bitcoin trading with high levels of liquidity for aggressive short-selling and knock the prices really low,” said Think Markets analyst Naeem Aslam.  “Players now have an incentive to be on the short side and make profits hedging against the upside.”  Concerns about cybersecurity could also take the shine off of bitcoin.   Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace NiceHash, which matches people looking to sell processing time on computers in exchange for bitcoin, said on Thursday it had lost about $64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system.  Bitcoin slumped in 2014 when MtGox, then the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, collapsed after saying it had been hacked and had 650,000 bitcoins stolen.   The value of all cryptocurrencies now stands at nearly $430 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.   Bitcoin has more than tripled in price since the start of October, putting it on track for its best quarter since the end of 2013, when it surged above $1,000 for the first time.

571,New York regulator moving ahead on bitcoin regulation,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0LG1P520140211,"February 11, 2014 03:40pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - New York’s financial regulator on Tuesday revealed new details on his agency’s plans to govern virtual currency firms in the state in order to protect consumers and combat money laundering.  Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, expects to adopt enhanced consumer disclosure rules, capital requirements and a framework for permissible investments with consumer money.  Lawsky has said he plans to issue a “BitLicense” for businesses that use the new currencies, and he intends to provide regulations this year, which could make New York the first U.S. state to regulate virtual currencies such as bitcoins.  In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Lawsky said consumers need to know that virtual currency transactions are generally irreversible, and that they could lose their principal if they hold onto bitcoins for an extended period.  Lawsky said more challenging questions include what capital requirements firms must have on balance sheets to absorb unexpected losses, and how many risks they can take with investments using consumer money. One issue is whether the firms should be allowed to invest in virtual currencies.  “Our objective is to provide appropriate guard rails to protect consumers and root out money laundering - without stifling beneficial innovation,” Lawsky said in prepared remarks for an event at the New America Foundation.  His agency is still wrestling with whether to ban or restrict the use of “tumblers”, which obscure the record and source of virtual currencies. He said tumblers are a concern to law enforcement, but that they might have legitimate uses.  He said most virtual currencies have public ledgers which, when combined with know-your-customer guidelines, could serve as anti-money laundering controls.  Lawsky added that he is grappling with what types of firms and transactions to regulate.  The remarks follow two days of hearings in New York on the potential regulation of virtual currencies. Witnesses at the late January hearings included state and federal prosecutors, as well as industry participants such as the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Lawsky said the hearings, which were streamed on the agency’s website, were watched by more than 14,000 people from 117 countries.  He spoke on Tuesday at an event hosted by “Future Tense,” a partnership between Slate magazine, the New America Foundation and Arizona State University to explore emerging technologies.

575,Chinese bitcoin miners eye sites in energy-rich Canada,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1F10BU,"January 12, 2018 09:16am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"MONTREAL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Bitmain Technologies is eyeing bitcoin mining sites in Quebec, a company spokesman told Reuters, as expectations of a potential Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency mining make the energy-rich Canadian province an attractive alternative.  China has grown into one of the world’s biggest sources of cryptocurrency mining but there are signs Beijing is increasing scrutiny of the sector’s players and may ask local authorities to regulate their power use. Bitmain Technologies, operator of some of the largest mining farms in the country, is among several companies looking to expand overseas.  Bitmain spokesman Nishant Sharma said in an e-mail on Friday that the company was looking at sites in Quebec and is in talks with regional power authorities in the province. It is also planning to expand in Switzerland.  Bitcoin mining consumes large quantities of energy because it uses computers to solve complex math puzzles to validate transactions in the cryptocurrency, which are written to the blockchain, or digital ledger. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded in bitcoin and the transaction is added to the blockchain.  While Beijing has not issued any official edict on the bitcoin mines, two Chinese miners told Reuters that local authorities had grown more unwilling to allow expansion and had started to shut down some mines in late 2017, as China clamped down on cryptocurrencies.   Last September, Chinese authorities banned so-called initial coin offerings and ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to halt trading.  “We, and from what I understand many of our peers, are already making plans to go overseas,” said Li Wei, chief executive of ZQMiner, a Wuhan-based company that sells bitcoin mining equipment and has mines in three Chinese provinces.   Globally, regulators are increasingly voicing concerns about cryptocurrencies, which are not backed by any central bank, because of their volatility and worries about risks to investors. China, which has strict capital controls, is also worried that cryptocurrencies could facilitate illegal fund flows and breed financial risks.   In Canada, Hydro Quebec described a potential sales pipeline of around 30 large cryptocurrency miners after a campaign by the public utility to attract data centres to the province triggered a flurry of interest from bitcoin miners in 2017.  “Of the world’s top five largest blockchain players, we have at least three or four,” David Vincent,  director of business development at Hydro Quebec distribution, said in an interview on Wednesday.  Stephane Paquet, a vice president of Montreal International, which promotes foreign investment in the province’s largest city, has called Quebec a place for “green bitcoin.”  According to Hydro Quebec, the province has an energy surplus equivalent to 100 Terawatt hours over 10 years. One terawatt hour powers 60,000 homes in Quebec during a year.   Neither Hydro Quebec nor Montreal International would divulge names of interested miners. Vincent said companies are eyeing operations from about 20 megawatts, the size of a data centre, to sites as large as 300 megawatts, about the size of a small aluminum smelter.  He expects some of the large companies to begin operations in Quebec this year and in early 2019. Bitmain’s spokesman said that Bitmain has been mining in Canada since 2016, but did not say where.  The challenge for miners is finding existing facilities in Quebec that already have buildings and other infrastructure in place to use the large energy supply required for cryptocurrency mining. A new facility would take about a year to be operational.    “We have the energy available,” said Eric Filion, customer vice-president for Hydro Quebec’s distribution division. “It’s a question of finding land and buildings quickly.”  Hydro Quebec, which offers some of the lowest electricity rates in North America, charges an industrial rate of $0.0248 per kilowatt hour (Kwh) (2.48 U.S. cents) for data centres and $0.0394/kwh (3.94 U.S. cents) for cryptocurrency customers. Customers would have to assume other start-up costs, Filion said.   Textiles and pulp and paper factories are particularly attractive to cryptocurrency mining companies.   Alain Bourdages, a company vice president at Montreal-based Resolute Forest Products Inc (RFP.N), said by phone that the company has been contacted by cryptocurrency companies about possibly sharing their existing production sites, or ones that are no longer in use.    “We are looking at this prudently,” he said. “It’s an interesting opportunity that could generate value.”  In central Canada’s Manitoba province, provincial government-owned utility Manitoba Hydro has fielded more than 100 inquiries from cryptocurrency miners in the past three months about specific sites, a company spokesman said.  The interest includes North American brokers who represent Chinese investors, attracted by Manitoba’s cheap power and potential reduced cooling requirements, spokesman Bruce Owen said. It is working with two large-scale cryptocurrency operations that want to set up in Manitoba, he said.      Manitoba’s power rates may soon rise, however. Manitoba Hydro is asking the province’s utilities board to approve a rate increase of 7.9 percent across the board, effective April 1, 2018. That is far larger than utility rate changes proposed last year in other provinces, including 0.7 percent in Quebec, according to Manitoba Hydro data.

It is deadly,” central bank head Lars Rohde said in an interview with state broadcaster DR published online on Monday.  The comments echoed concerns of a bubble about to burst made by other market participants and central bankers after the price of bitcoin rocketed more than 1,800 percent since the start of the year.  Rohde said that if people decide to ignore his warnings, they should realize that they are pretty much on their own.  “It is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual,” said Rohde.  Emphasizing his point, Rohde told investors not to “come and complain to us if it goes wrong”.  The launch of futures trading in bitcoin has further fueled debate about the place of the cryptocurrency in the financial system.  On Sunday, France’s finance minister said his country would propose that the G20 group of major economies discuss regulation of the bitcoin virtual currency next year.  Decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin are still not widely accepted, and critics say that the fact that they are unregulated makes them risky to use.   European Union states and legislators last week agreed stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing on exchange platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  “I see bitcoin as tulipmania, which is a bubble that is out of control,” Rohde said, referring to a notorious 17th century Dutch boom and bust.  Last week, the Danish central bank said that introducing a digital version of the Danish crown currency would pose risks to financial stability without improving payment solutions for Danes.

Global policymakers have warned investors to be cautious in trading the digital currency given the lack of broad regulatory oversight.  In Ho, a professor at Korea University’s Blockchain Research Institute, said the stolen coins were most likely to be from the more insecure ‘hot wallets.’  “Since coins in the cold wallets are not at all wired to the internet, it would have been impossible for hackers to steal those in cold wallets unless they physically broke in,” said In, a blockchain expert at the research center.   Bithumb did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments, and its statement did not say whether the stolen coins were stored in its ‘hot wallets’.   Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at ESTsecurity, said digital coins would continue to be juicy targets for hackers around the world.  “No security measures or regulations can 100 percent guarantee safety of virtual coins. It is held anonymously and in lightly-secured systems, which makes them an irresistible target,” Mun said.   On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp, bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down 1.8 percent at $6,612.92 by 0351 GMT, extending losses as a series of intrusions on cryptocurrency exchanges in recent weeks sparked  concerns over security.   It has fallen roughly 70 percent from its all-time peak hit around mid-December 2017.    On June 11, another South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail said it was hacked. The cyber attacks come after a high-profile theft of over half a billion dollars worth of digital currency at Japan’s exchange Coincheck earlier this year.  In January, South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading to stop cryptocurrencies being used in money laundering and other crimes. But the government said it does not intend to go as far as shutting down domestic exchanges.  Bithumb trades more than 37 different virtual coins, according to Coinmarketcap.com   Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong",-0.14204117647058825,0.00043355119825708003

579,Bitcoin hits new record high as warnings grow louder,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E919T,"December 15, 2017 04:41pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin blasted to another all-time high of almost $18,000 on the Bitstamp exchange on Friday, up 9 percent on the day, as warnings grew over the risks of investing in the highly volatile and speculative instrument.   The cryptocurrency’s staggering recent price rises — more than 1,700 percent since the start of the year — have driven worries that the market is a bubble that could burst in spectacular fashion.   Bitcoin has climbed almost 80 percent so far in December alone, putting it on track for its best month in percentage terms since December 2013.   On Friday it reached as high as $17,900 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   While bitcoin has added another fifth to its value since Monday, trading has been slightly calmer than the wild price swings the market has seen in recent weeks, with volatility lower since the launch of bitcoin futures from Cboe Global Markets on Sunday.   Market-watchers said bitcoin’s price was being lifted by the launch of rival CME Group’s bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday.   “The hope (is) that futures signal the unlocking of institutional money into the digital arena and (that there will be) a rapid demand increase and ratification of the technology and its principles,” said Charles Hayter, founder of industry website Cryptocompare.    But outside of the crypto market, worries continue to grow about the amount of money piling into the space.   A study by Anglia Ruskin University, Trinity College Dublin and Dublin City University released on Friday said bitcoin could pose a threat to the financial stability of traditional currencies and markets.  “Our evidence finds that the price of Bitcoin has been artificially inflated by speculative investment, putting it in a bubble,” said Larisa Yarovaya, one of the report’s authors and a lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University.  “Although bitcoin is not regulated by governments, it could still have a knock-on effect on traditional markets due to the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets with other financial assets.”  Others, however, say bitcoin’s total market size — around $300 billion — mean the impact of any future price collapse would not be large enough to have a knock-on effect on financial stability.   The BBC reported late on Thursday that the head of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, had warned that bitcoin buyers should be prepared for the possibility that they could “lose all their money”.  Outages on some of the world’s biggest exchanges this week, which left millions of investors unable to access their funds during periods when trading volumes are high, have also fueled concerns about the fragility of the market’s infrastructure.

580,U.S. fund firms make new push for bitcoin ETFs as futures debut,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E51O4,"December 11, 2017 02:03pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"(Reuters) - Fund managers are racing to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on bitcoin after futures contracts based on the high-flying digital currency began trading on Sunday.  Three more fund managers are proposing bitcoin funds that would use futures to gain access to the market instead of investing directly in them, filings showed on Monday.  REX Shares LLC, Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP each filed proposals with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since Friday, according to the documents.  REX and Van Eck declined to comment while the fund proposals are pending, and a First Trust spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. ProShare Capital Management LLC made a similar filing earlier this year.  “There’s a real advantage, particularly in a niche ETF, to being the first one that gets to market, that gets the trading volume,” said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of ETF.com. The website is owned by CBOE Global Markets Inc CBOE.O, which listed the first bitcoin futures contracts and plans to list bitcoin ETFs if they are approved.  “We’re in pretty untested territory here. There’s hasn’t been anything like bitcoin before so there hasn’t been anything like bitcoin futures before.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, but proponents think a successful debut of futures could revive the concept. ETFs could make it easier for investors to bet on bitcoin’s price rising or falling because they can be bought and sold like stocks.  The front-month bitcoin contract <0#XBT:>, which expires in January, traded at $17,870 on Monday afternoon. Bitcoin is up more than 1,500 percent so far in 2017, having started the year at less than $1,000, and its gains in the past month have been rapid.  The asset trades largely on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges, and demand for an exchange-listed product has been intense. Investors have turned to a small set of existing products, including the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC.PK), an “over-the-counter” offering in the United States that sometimes sells for more double what the bitcoin it holds is worth.  Sunday’s bitcoin futures debut could change that, with backers hoping the market will confer greater legitimacy on the volatile cryptocurrency and lead to its wider use. Other exchanges are due to list their own bitcoin futures.  The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are virtual currency entrepreneurs.  The SEC blocked the brothers from launching their own ETF in March, citing the fact that the currency trades in unregulated markets. CBOE’s Bats exchange, which wanted to host that ETF, appealed the ruling.  A number of rival applications have popped up in the months since, betting that a fund structured differently could win SEC approval. A number of the proposals rely on the futures, which do trade in regulated markets.  But the SEC told backers of those proposals they would not consider them until the futures started trading.  Van Eck is also teaming up with Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) to develop a new bitcoin futures contract, a source told Reuters last month.

582,Breakingviews - EU transparency purge may boost bitcoin legitimacy,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1IF2RF,"May 15, 2018 07:34am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - A European Union transparency drive may boost bitcoin’s legitimacy. The bloc agreed on Monday to force cryptocurrency exchanges to identify users. That will make it harder for criminals to use virtual cash to hide their ill-gotten gains.  The EU’s bitcoin assault is part of a broader attack on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To do so, the bloc is updating the existing anti-money laundering directive to shed light on opaque areas of the financial world. One key novelty is a requirement for the dozens of European exchanges which trade in currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, and the technology companies that store the money in so-called wallets, to carry out the same know-your-customer checks as ordinary banks.  The new rules are an important step in the fight against illicit money flows. Anonymity, guaranteed via encrypted procedures, is probably one of the main reasons for the soaring popularity of digital currencies, which have seen their market values exceed $400 billion this year. Paying for goods and services in bitcoin or similar allows users to bypass regulated payment systems. That appeals to drug dealers or terrorists. BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink recently called virtual currencies an “index of money laundering”.  The European transparency push could help change things. If transactions are no longer secret, this should deter usage for illicit means, and facilitate the work of law-enforcement agencies. It may also make it harder for criminals to hack exchanges, as happened with Slovenian group NiceHash last year.  Criminals can still use exchanges outside the EU. There’s also a danger that more trading simply moves off exchanges. But Europe is not alone in the fight. South Korea imposed similar rules earlier this year, and the United States may not be far behind. If more trading happens out of the shadows, virtual currencies could become more respectable.

584,Factbox: Things you might not know about ballistic bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E12RE,"December 08, 2017 04:42pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (The version of the December 7 story corrects the theoretical value of bitcoin bought in 2013 and held to present day to $1.2 million instead of $120 million in the seventh paragraph.)  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin rocketed to another record high close of $16,000 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday after gaining more than $4,000 in just 48 hours, stoking concerns that a rapidly swelling bubble could be set to burst.  There were huge disparities between prices across different exchanges. On GDAX, one of the biggest, the price reached  $19,500.   Here are some facts that you might not know about the largest and best-known cryptocurrency.   Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million - a number that is expected to be reached around the year 2140. So far, around 16.7 million bitcoins have been released into the system, with 12.5 new ones released roughly every 10 minutes via a process called “mining”, in which a global network of computers competes to solve complex algorithms in reward for the new bitcoins.   These mining computers require a vast amount of energy to run. As the price increases, more miners enter the market, driving up the energy consumption further. A recent estimate by tech news site Motherboard put the energy cost of a single bitcoin transaction at 215 kilowatt-hours, assuming that there are around 300,000 bitcoin transactions per day. That’s almost enough energy as the average American household consumes in a whole week.   If you want to buy bitcoin, you do not need to buy a whole one. Bitcoin’s smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin, making it worth around $0.0002 at current exchange rates.   Bitcoin has performed better than every central bank-issued currency in every year since 2011 except for 2014, when it performed worse than any traditional currency. So far in 2017, it is up more than 1,400 percent. If you had bought $1,000 of bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it, you would now be sitting on around $1.2 million. Many people consider bitcoin to be more of a speculative instrument than a currency, because of its volatility, high transaction fees, and the fact that relatively few merchants accept it.   More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, either by hackers or insiders. That’s a total of more than $15 billion at current exchange rates. Few have been recovered.  Despite many attempts to find the creator of bitcoin, and a number of claims, we still do not know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or was. Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur Craig Wright convinced some prominent members of the bitcoin community that he was Nakamoto in May 2016, but he then refused to provide the evidence that most of the community said was necessary. It is not clear whether Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym, was a name used by a group of developers or by one individual. Nor is it clear that Nakamoto is still alive - the late computer scientist Hal Finney’s name is sometimes put forward. Developer Nick Szabo has denied claims that he is Nakamoto, as has tech entrepreneur Elon Musk more recently.   Until earlier this year, it was thought that Chinese exchanges accounted for around 90 percent of trading volume. But it has become clear that some exchanges inflated their volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of bitcoin back and forth between accounts. Since the Chinese authorities imposed transaction fees, Chinese trading volumes have fallen sharply, and now represent less than 20 percent, according to data from website Bitcoinity.  The total value of all bitcoins released into the system so far has now reached as high as $283 billion. That makes its total value - sometimes dubbed its “market cap” - greater than that of Visa, and bigger than the market cap of BlackRock and Citigroup combined.   CRYPTO-RIVALS  Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency. There are now well over 1,000 rivals, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.  It is already possible to short bitcoin on a number of retail platforms and exchanges, via contracts for difference (CFDs), leveraged-up margin trading or by borrowing bitcoin from exchanges without leverage. But a number of big financial institutions - including CME Group, CBOE and Nasdaq - have recently announced that they will offer bitcoin futures, which will open up the possibility of shorting the cryptocurrency to the mainstream professional investment universe.  Many fewer than the 16.7 bitcoins that have been mined are actually in circulation and accessible, because of forgotten passwords, accidental losses, hoarding, owners forgetting about coins or even dying. It is impossible to know for sure how many bitcoins have been permanently lost, because those that have are still in the system, in dormant addresses. But according to a December 2013 research paper by the University of San Diego and George Mason University, 64 percent of the 12 million bitcoins that had by then been mined had never been spent. Bitcoin developer Sergio Lerner estimates that almost 1 million unspent bitcoins belong to the cryptocurrency’s mysterious creator.  There are 5,638,155 bitcoins in the 1,000 biggest wallets - more than a third of all bitcoins in circulation. That makes the 1,000 biggest wallet-holders worth a collective $87 billion, at current rates.   The average fee paid to process bitcoin transactions has soared over the past year, outpacing even the staggering price increase of the cryptocurrency itself. Each bitcoin transaction now costs around $7.30 to process, up from around 30 cents at the start of the year, according to trade website BitInfoCharts.   If you owned bitcoin prior to Aug. 1, 2017, you also own Bitcoin Cash - a clone of the original. That is because on that date bitcoin underwent a so-called “fork”, in which the underlying software code was split into two. One unit of Bitcoin Cash is now worth more than $1,300. That adds roughly another 135 percent to the returns from a bitcoin investment at the start of the year.   Reporting by Jemima Kelly; editing by Mark Heinrich",0.08835833333333333,0.09199070316257817

His lawyer, Steve Ungar, said in a statement that they were pleased the SEC had approved the settlement, and that Burnside worked to protect website users and to cooperate with the SEC.  The exchanges had solicited more than 10,000 users who  opened online accounts and executed more than 425,000 trader, the SEC said.   The settlement requires Burnside to pay $58,387 in profits and interest, and a penalty of $10,000.   Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Bernadette Baum",0.29475555555555555,0.1119047619047619

Bitmain Switzerland was registered in Zug, Switzerland in late December according to commercial registry filings accessed on Wednesday.   Experts say China is one of the world’s biggest sources of bitcoin mining, where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles with computers in order to be awarded virtual coins.  But a government clampdown on electricity-intensive cryptocurrency mining could soon see that activity move elsewhere.  “Bitmain Switzerland will play a central role during our global expansion,” a spokesman for the Beijing-based group told Swiss paper Handelszeitung. The paper first reported the group’s expansion to Switzerland on Wednesday.  Bitmain Technologies was not immediately available for comment nearing midnight Beijing time.  Founded in Beijing in 2013, Bitmain is a leading bitcoin miner which also makes chips and computer hardware for mining.  Besides Beijing it currently has offices in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Qingdao, Chengdu, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to its website.  Zug, a small canton in the middle of Switzerland, has become known as the Swiss “Crypto Valley” due to the proliferation of cryptocurrency groups setting up shop there.  The Swiss company, Bitmain Switzerland, was registered to directors Jihan Wu, the name of Bitmain Technologies’ co-founder, as well as a Chinese national by the name of Ti Liu residing in Birrwil, Switzerland and a Swiss national, Christian Johannes Meisser, residing in Klosters-Serneus.

Bitcoin received a boost after Friday’s announcement by the main U.S. derivatives regulator that it would allow CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets to list bitcoin futures contracts.  The move opens the door to added regulation but also more mainstream adoption, as bitcoin futures and other derivatives would make it easier to trade the new asset class.  “Simply the perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.  Bitcoin’s ascent of over 10-fold from below $1,000 at the start of the year has drawn regulatory scrutiny around the world.   Some high profile individuals such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz have said the cryptocurrency should be outlawed.  “It took a long time to establish the methodology and the way bitcoin was traded. The original appeal came from the fact they were unregulated. However it’s clearly moved out of those shadows and into center stage,” said Mick McCarthy, CMC Markets’ chief market strategist in Sydney.  “We are in the throes of a bubble market, and one of the characteristics of a bubble market is that there is no way to know when the bubble will burst.”  The current craze for bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, have been likened by some to the 17th century Dutch tulip mania and more recently the dotcom bubble.  “If you look at this sort of pattern it has repeated itself many, many times. The only way it ends is when sentiment shifts and that’s a deeply unpredictable thing,” Cambridge Global Payments’ Schamotta said.  Bitcoin was up 12.42 percent at $13,127.01 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP after surging to the record peak of $13,127.01.  “There is a lot of money flowing into bitcoin right now, mostly motivated by “fear of missing out” and greed,” said Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong.

Benjamin Lawksy, superintendent of financial services for the state of New York, said the new digital currency rules known as the “BitLicense” will focus on overseeing financial intermediaries only. Lawsky made the remarks on Wednesday at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington.  “There is a basic bargain that when a financial company is entrusted with safeguarding customer funds and receives a license from the state to do so - it accepts the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny to help ensure that a consumer’s money does not just disappear into a black hole,” said Lawsky.

592,UPDATE 1-Bitcoin hits new record high as warnings grow louder,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1OF2WH,"December 15, 2017 07:32am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin blasted to another all-time high of almost $18,000 on the Bitstamp exchange on Friday, up 9 percent on the day, as warnings grew over the risks of investing in the highly volatile and speculative instrument.   The cryptocurrency’s staggering recent price rises — more than 1,700 percent since the start of the year — have driven worries that the market is a bubble that could burst in spectacular fashion.   Bitcoin has climbed almost 80 percent so far in December alone, putting it on track for its best month in percentage terms since December 2013.   On Friday it reached as high as $17,900 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.   While bitcoin has added another fifth to its value since Monday, trading has been slightly calmer than the wild price swings the market has seen in recent weeks, with volatility lower since the launch of bitcoin futures from Cboe Global Markets on Sunday.   Market-watchers said bitcoin’s price was being lifted by the launch of rival CME Group’s bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday.   “The hope (is) that futures signal the unlocking of institutional money into the digital arena and (that there will be) a rapid demand increase and ratification of the technology and its principles,” said Charles Hayter, founder of industry website Cryptocompare.    But outside of the crypto market, worries continue to grow about the amount of money piling into the space.   A study by Anglia Ruskin University, Trinity College Dublin and Dublin City University released on Friday said bitcoin could pose a threat to the financial stability of traditional currencies and markets.  “Our evidence finds that the price of Bitcoin has been artificially inflated by speculative investment, putting it in a bubble,” said Larisa Yarovaya, one of the report’s authors and a lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University.  “Although bitcoin is not regulated by governments, it could still have a knock-on effect on traditional markets due to the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets with other financial assets.”  Others, however, say bitcoin’s total market size — around $300 billion — mean the impact of any future price collapse would not be large enough to have a knock-on effect on financial stability.   The BBC reported late on Thursday that the head of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, had warned that bitcoin buyers should be prepared for the possibility that they could “lose all their money”.  Outages on some of the world’s biggest exchanges this week, which left millions of investors unable to access their funds during periods when trading volumes are high, have also fueled concerns about the fragility of the market’s infrastructure.

595,"Corrected: Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E729L,"December 13, 2017 11:28am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (Corrects June 2 story to remove reference to bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ status in Japan as “legal tender.”)  By Minami Funakoshi and Joyce Lee  TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Long the preserve of geeky enthusiasts, bitcoin is going mainstream in Asia, attracting Mrs Watanabe - the metaphorical Japanese housewife investor - South Korean retirees and thousands of others trying to escape rock-bottom savings rates by investing in the cryptocurrency.  Asia’s moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin’s 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.  Even after a tumble from last week’s record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone - driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.  Over the last two weeks, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.  “After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.  “Everyone says we can’t rely on Japanese pensions anymore,” she said. “This worries me, so I started bitcoins.”  Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region’s thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.  “Right now, it’s a form of speculation, like stocks,” said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. “I don’t think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.”  The risks, though, are rising too.  Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy.  In Hong Kong, bitcoin exchanges operate under money service operator licenses - like money changers - while in South Korea they are regulated similar to online shopping malls, trading physical goods. Often there are no rules on investor protection.  Park and Higo were drawn into bitcoin by friends. Others are attracted through seminars, social media groups and blogs penned by amateur investors.  Noboru Hanaki, a 27-year-old Japanese web marketer and bitcoin investor, said his personal finance blog gets around 30,000 page views each month. The most popular post is an explanation of bitcoin, he said, noting that when the bitcoin price surged last month, readership of the article doubled.  Rachel Poole, a Hong Kong-based kindergarten teacher, said she read about bitcoin in the press, and bought five bitcoins in March for around HK$40,000 ($5,100) after studying blogs on the topic. She kept four as an investment and has made HK$12,000 tax-free trading the fifth after classes.  “I wish I’d done it earlier,” she said.  Not everyone’s making money.   The bitcoin frenzy has spawned scams, with police in South Korea last month uncovering a $55 million cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that sucked in thousands of homemakers, workers and self-employed businessmen seduced by slick marketing and promises of wealth.  Seminars in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong promote similar multi-level marketing schemes that require investors to pay an upfront membership fee of as much as $9,000. Members are encouraged to promote the cryptocurrency and bring in new members in return for some bitcoins and other benefits.  One such Tokyo scheme offered members-only shopping websites that accept bitcoin, 24-hour assistance for car and computer problems, and bitcoin-based gifts when a member gets married, has a baby - or even dies, according to marketing materials seen by Reuters.  Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong and a bitcoin investor, warned amateur investors against speculating in the digital currency.  “Trading carries huge risk: there is no investor protection and plenty of market manipulation and insider trading. Some of the exchanges cannot be trusted in my opinion.”  Some larger exchanges have voluntarily adopted security measures and compensation guarantees, according to their websites, although there are dozens of smaller platforms operating more or less unchecked.  In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has set up a task force to explore regulating cryptocurrencies, but it has not set a timeline for publishing its conclusions, an official there said.  In Japan - where memories are still fresh of the spectacular 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange at the time - the Financial Services Agency (FSA) said it supervises bitcoin exchanges, but not traders or investors.  “The government is not guaranteeing the value of cryptocurrencies. We are asking for bitcoin exchanges to fully explain the risk of sharp price moves,” an FSA official said.  Some professional investors say bitcoin can be a useful hedge to help diversify a portfolio, but investors should be cautious.  “This is an extremely volatile and innovative asset class,” said Pietro Ventani, managing director of APP Advisers, an asset allocation strategy firm.

596,"Bitcoin falls 30 percent, posts worst week since 2013",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EG0AA,"December 22, 2017 04:39pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged by 30 percent to below $12,000 on Friday as investors dumped the cryptocurrency after its sharp rise to a peak close to $20,000 prompted warnings by experts of a bubble.   After falling to as low as $11,159, it recouped some losses to trade above $14,000 on the Bitstamp platform, down 9 percent on the day. It is down around 25 percent this week, its largest weekly loss since April 2013.  It capped a brutal week that had been touted as a new era of mainstream trading for the digital currency when bitcoin futures debuted on CME Group Inc, the world’s largest derivatives market on Sunday.  Friday’s fall bled into the U.S. stock market, where shares of companies that have lashed their fortunes to bitcoin or blockchain - its underlying technology - took a knock. Long Blockchain Corp, Overstock.com Inc, Riot Blockchain Inc and Marathon Patent Group Inc lost between 2 percent and 15 percent.  The biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has risen around twentyfold since the start of the year, climbing from less than $1,000 to as high as $19,666 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday and to over $20,000 on other exchanges. But it has fallen each day since.    In the futures market, bitcoin one-month futures <0#XBT:> on Cboe Global Markets were earlier halted due to the steep price drop, while those trading on the CME hit the limit down threshold.  “The crypto markets have experienced several flash crashes over the past few years but we do believe there has been some overvaluation in the market, particularly over recent months,” said Jamie Burke, chief executive officer at venture capital firm Outlier Ventures.  “It’s much more likely this is a natural correction following over-exuberant market sentiment.”   On Friday, Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, told Bloomberg he had halted plans to launch a crypto-currency hedge fund. (bloom.bg/2BA9gGN)  “We didn’t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing,” he told Bloomberg.   His Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15, but he called clients on Dec. 12 and told them he had changed his mind, Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg.  Novogratz told Reuters in November he hoped to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.  Warnings about the risks of investing in the unregulated market have increased - Denmark’s central bank governor called it a “deadly” gamble - and there have been worries about the security of exchanges on which cryptocurrencies are bought and sold.   South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit said on Tuesday it is shutting down and is filing for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the second time this year.   Coinbase, a U.S. company that runs one of the biggest exchanges and provides digital “wallets” for storing bitcoins, said on Wednesday it would investigate accusations of insider trading, following a sharp rise in the price of a bitcoin spin-off hours before it announced support for it.  On Friday, Coinbase said it had temporarily suspended buying and selling of bitcoin due to high traffic.  CRYPTO-RIVALS   As some rival cryptocurrencies slid along with bitcoin, the total estimated value of the crypto market fell to as low as $440 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, having neared $650 billion just a day earlier.   But other cryptocurrencies rose this week, with investors moving into cheaper digital coins, rather than cashing out of the sector.   Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market size, soared to almost $900 earlier in the week, from around $500 a week earlier. Ripple, the third-biggest, has more than quadrupled in price since Monday.   Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for retail FX broker Oanda in Singapore, said there had also been moves out of bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, a clone of the original cryptocurrency. Oanda does not handle trading in bitcoin.  “Most of it is unsophisticated retail traders getting burned badly,” Innes said on bitcoin’s recent retreat.  While some say the launch by CME and its rival Cboe Global Markets of bitcoin futures over the last two weeks has given the digital currency some perceived legitimacy, many policymakers remain skeptical.  Bitcoin is known to go through wild swings. In November, it tumbled almost 30 percent in four days from $7,888 to $5,555. In September, it fell 40 percent from $4,979 to $2,972.

598,Chinese bitcoin miners eye sites in energy-rich Canada,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1P620N,"January 11, 2018 11:07pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"MONTREAL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Bitmain Technologies is eyeing bitcoin mining sites in Quebec, a company spokesman told Reuters, as expectations of a potential Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency mining make the energy-rich Canadian province an attractive alternative.  China has grown into one of the world’s biggest sources of cryptocurrency mining but there are signs Beijing is increasing scrutiny of the sector’s players and may ask local authorities to regulate their power use. Bitmain Technologies, operator of some of the largest mining farms in the country, is among several companies looking to expand overseas.  Bitmain spokesman Nishant Sharma said in an e-mail on Friday that the company was looking at sites in Quebec and is in talks with regional power authorities in the province. It is also planning to expand in Switzerland.  Bitcoin mining consumes large quantities of energy because it uses computers to solve complex math puzzles to validate transactions in the cryptocurrency, which are written to the blockchain, or digital ledger. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded in bitcoin and the transaction is added to the blockchain.  While Beijing has not issued any official edict on the bitcoin mines, two Chinese miners told Reuters that local authorities had grown more unwilling to allow expansion and had started to shut down some mines in late 2017, as China clamped down on cryptocurrencies.   Last September, Chinese authorities banned so-called initial coin offerings and ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to halt trading.  “We, and from what I understand many of our peers, are already making plans to go overseas,” said Li Wei, chief executive of ZQMiner, a Wuhan-based company that sells bitcoin mining equipment and has mines in three Chinese provinces.   Globally, regulators are increasingly voicing concerns about cryptocurrencies, which are not backed by any central bank, because of their volatility and worries about risks to investors. China, which has strict capital controls, is also worried that cryptocurrencies could facilitate illegal fund flows and breed financial risks.   In Canada, Hydro Quebec described a potential sales pipeline of around 30 large cryptocurrency miners after a campaign by the public utility to attract data centres to the province triggered a flurry of interest from bitcoin miners in 2017.  “Of the world’s top five largest blockchain players, we have at least three or four,” David Vincent,  director of business development at Hydro Quebec distribution, said in an interview on Wednesday.  Stephane Paquet, a vice president of Montreal International, which promotes foreign investment in the province’s largest city, has called Quebec a place for “green bitcoin.”  According to Hydro Quebec, the province has an energy surplus equivalent to 100 Terawatt hours over 10 years. One terawatt hour powers 60,000 homes in Quebec during a year.   Neither Hydro Quebec nor Montreal International would divulge names of interested miners. Vincent said companies are eyeing operations from about 20 megawatts, the size of a data centre, to sites as large as 300 megawatts, about the size of a small aluminum smelter.  He expects some of the large companies to begin operations in Quebec this year and in early 2019. Bitmain’s spokesman said that Bitmain has been mining in Canada since 2016, but did not say where.  The challenge for miners is finding existing facilities in Quebec that already have buildings and other infrastructure in place to use the large energy supply required for cryptocurrency mining. A new facility would take about a year to be operational.    “We have the energy available,” said Eric Filion, customer vice-president for Hydro Quebec’s distribution division. “It’s a question of finding land and buildings quickly.”  Hydro Quebec, which offers some of the lowest electricity rates in North America, charges an industrial rate of $0.0248 per kilowatt hour (Kwh) (2.48 U.S. cents) for data centres and $0.0394/kwh (3.94 U.S. cents) for cryptocurrency customers. Customers would have to assume other start-up costs, Filion said.   Textiles and pulp and paper factories are particularly attractive to cryptocurrency mining companies.   Alain Bourdages, a company vice president at Montreal-based Resolute Forest Products Inc (RFP.N), said by phone that the company has been contacted by cryptocurrency companies about possibly sharing their existing production sites, or ones that are no longer in use.    “We are looking at this prudently,” he said. “It’s an interesting opportunity that could generate value.”  In central Canada’s Manitoba province, provincial government-owned utility Manitoba Hydro has fielded more than 100 inquiries from cryptocurrency miners in the past three months about specific sites, a company spokesman said.  The interest includes North American brokers who represent Chinese investors, attracted by Manitoba’s cheap power and potential reduced cooling requirements, spokesman Bruce Owen said. It is working with two large-scale cryptocurrency operations that want to set up in Manitoba, he said.      Manitoba’s power rates may soon rise, however. Manitoba Hydro is asking the province’s utilities board to approve a rate increase of 7.9 percent across the board, effective April 1, 2018. That is far larger than utility rate changes proposed last year in other provinces, including 0.7 percent in Quebec, according to Manitoba Hydro data.

599,UPDATE 1-Nasdaq plans bitcoin futures contract in 2018 - source,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1NZ1CW,"November 29, 2017 11:48am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc plans to launch a futures contract based on bitcoin in 2018, making it the third exchange operator to plan U.S. derivatives contracts linked to the digital currency, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.  The price of bitcoin  topped $11,000 on Wednesday less than a day after passing the $10,000 mark and has increased more than 10-fold in value so far this year, prompting concerns of a bubble.   CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, and CBOE Holdings, have both said they plan to launch futures products based on bitcoin this year, pending regulatory approval, helping fuel the crypto-currency’s rally.  While Nasdaq does not have a hard date set for its product, the transatlantic exchange operator has offered an exchange-traded note based on bitcoin on its Stockholm exchange since 2015.   Nasdaq has teamed up with New York-based money manager VanEck to develop the futures contract, which will be cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation. The OCC clears all Nasdaq futures products, the source said.   VanEck had applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year to launch a bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund, but withdrew the request in September after speaking with SEC staff, according to a regulatory filing.  The SEC requested that VanEck wait until the underlying instruments in which the ETF planned to primarily invest - bitcoin futures contracts - become available for investment, the filing said.  A representative for VanEck was not immediately available for comment.  One of the ways the Nasdaq futures product will differ from CME’s and CBOE’s is that it will be based on an index that takes in prices from more than 50 bitcoin exchanges, the source said.  CME has said it’s bitcoin future will be based on the CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin, that currently takes prices from four bitcoin exchanges.

600,UPDATE 1-U.S. derivatives regulator to review bitcoin futures risks,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1OZ14Q,"January 04, 2018 02:09pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator will hold two meetings to discuss the procedure and operational controls for listing and trading digital currency futures, it said on Thursday, amid rising concerns over the risks bitcoin poses to the financial system.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it would convene its technology and risk advisory committees this month to discuss its “self-certification” process for listing digital currency futures and how those products are risk-managed and policed.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASSA) have issued new warnings to investors over the risks of investing in bitcoin, cautioning regulators may not be able to protect them from fraudsters.   CME Group Inc (CME.O) and CBOE Global Markets Inc CBOE.O launched bitcoin futures in December, sparking criticism from some industry participants who said the regulator should have consulted the market more widely before allowing the products.  In December, the Futures Industry Association wrote to the CFTC expressing concern about the risks potentially posed by allowing futures in volatile virtual currencies to be traded alongside more traditional financial products.   The price of bitcoin soared to record highs of more than $19,000 in December, only to slump more than 28 percent - although it still ended the year up 1,300 percent.   The CFTC has been increasing its jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market, which has no overriding federal regulator, but is restricted by its limited legal power to actively block exchanges from launching futures products.  CFTC regulations allow designated exchanges to list products for trading without prior CFTC approval by filing a written self-certification with the regulator.  Under the self-certification process, which is a quirk of the futures market, the exchanges file a submission to the CFTC confirming the product complies with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations - including a key provision that requires that the contract is not susceptible to manipulation.  The CFTC has the power to block the contract but can only do so under exceptional circumstances.   The pair of advisory committee meetings are aimed at giving stakeholders the opportunity to discuss the issue.  “The responsible regulatory response to virtual currencies is consumer education, asserting CFTC authority, surveilling trading in derivative and spot markets, prosecuting fraud, abuse, manipulation and false solicitation and active coordination with fellow regulators,” CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo said in the statement, adding the CFTC was following this course of action.  On Thursday, his counterpart at the SEC Jay Clayton along with Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar, warned investors that many actors in the virtual currency market were violating state and federal laws.  “The SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations, but we again caution you that, if you lose money, there is a substantial risk that our efforts will not result in a recovery of your investment,” they said in the statement.

601,"CME says bitcoin futures coming this year, but date not set",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1NQ1RZ,"November 20, 2017 05:09pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - CME Group Inc, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said on Monday it still plans to launch a futures contract for bitcoin this year, but that a notice on its website stating the contract would begin trading on Dec. 11 was posted in error.  As bitcoin passed above the $8,000 level for the first time on Monday, cryptocurrency-related websites were abuzz with news of the CME notice that said the CME Bitcoin Futures contract would become effective on Dec. 10, a Sunday, for trading on Dec. 11, pending regulatory review.    But the notice was later removed from CME’s website and Laurie Bischel, a spokeswoman for the exchange operator, said the original posting “was due to an error with the website,” without giving further details.   CME is vying with rival Cboe Global Markets Inc to launch the first bitcoin-related financial product on a traditional, regulated exchange. [nL4N1N65PG]  Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and has risen in price by almost 50 percent in just the last days, prompting multiple warnings of a bubble. [nL8N1NQ49H]  To help rein in some of that volatility, CME will not allow the trading of bitcoin futures at prices 20 percent above or below the settlement price from the previous day, according to the exchange’s website.   As of Monday, CME had not yet filed with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to launch bitcoin futures, a spokeswoman for the company said.   Cboe also said it has yet to file with for a bitcoin futures contract with the CFTC, but spokeswoman Hannah Randall said the exchange operator was in active discussions with the regulator.   Cboe has said it sees launching a bitcoin futures contract as the first step to launching an exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin prices.   CFTC regulations allow designated contract markets such as CME to list products for trading without prior CFTC approval by filing a written self-certification with the regulator, meaning CME stipulates the product complies with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.  To self-certify a new product, the exchange must file its submission with the CFTC by the open of business on the business day before a product is to be listed.

The 58-year-old woman ordered the murder - which was never carried out - in March, transferring 4.1 bitcoin, then worth around $4,000, to the hitman’s virtual wallet, the court found.  Bitcoin can be transferred electronically between users without an intermediary such as a bank, making it potentially attractive for buying illegal goods or services.  The woman, who has lived in Denmark for 30 years, will be expelled after serving her sentence, the court said.

Bitcoin’s price has soared tenfold this year, prompting many market participants to warn of a bubble as it topped $11,000 for the first time last week.  Bitcoin futures and other derivatives would make it easier for more investors and speculators to trade the new asset class.   Cboe's bitcoin futures contract will trade under the ticker symbol 'XBT' and will be cash-settled based on the auction price from cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, Cboe said on Monday. (reut.rs/2BvXvwu)  CME’s bitcoin futures contract launches Dec. 18, available for trading on the CME Globex electronic trading platform, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange said on Friday.    Cboe and CME were given approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to list bitcoin futures on Friday after the rival bourses were able to show that their proposals met the necessary regulatory requirements.    The exchanges also had to agree to work together to monitor for manipulation, flash rallies, trading outages and other structural problems in the largely unregulated bitcoin cash market.  Once liquidity builds in the Cboe bitcoin futures contract and the exchanges are able to show how their oversight of the underlying market works, Cboe plans to reapply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a bitcoin ETF, Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said in an interview on Friday.  So far, the SEC has not allowed bitcoin-based ETFs on the CBOE or elsewhere, partly because of concerns around the unregulated aspect of bitcoin.    To help guard against excessive volatility, both Cboe and CME plan to have intraday price limits and initial margin rates of 30 and 35 percent respectively.   Nasdaq Inc also plans to list a futures contract based on bitcoin in 2018, Reuters reported last week.  The cryptocurrency was last up 0.4 percent at $11,290.

The state’s Department of Financial Services said it also approved Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the future.  Zcash's market value was roughly $1.3 billion on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, while Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin's respective values were $25 billion and $8.3 billion. Bitcoin's BTC=BTSP market value was about $150.1 billion.  “With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,” Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.  Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering.  Last month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures.   Zcash incorporates the technology “zk-snark,” short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity.  Gemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later.  “We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,” Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo’s office.  The Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc (FB.O) and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website.

605,"Bitcoin falls 30 percent, posts worst week since 2013",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EG0A8,"December 22, 2017 04:40pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged by 30 percent to below $12,000 on Friday as investors dumped the cryptocurrency after its sharp rise to a peak close to $20,000 prompted warnings by experts of a bubble.   After falling to as low as $11,159, it recouped some losses to trade above $14,000 on the Bitstamp platform, down 9 percent on the day. It is down around 25 percent this week, its largest weekly loss since April 2013.  It capped a brutal week that had been touted as a new era of mainstream trading for the digital currency when bitcoin futures debuted on CME Group Inc, the world’s largest derivatives market on Sunday.  Friday’s fall bled into the U.S. stock market, where shares of companies that have lashed their fortunes to bitcoin or blockchain - its underlying technology - took a knock. Long Blockchain Corp, Overstock.com Inc, Riot Blockchain Inc and Marathon Patent Group Inc lost between 2 percent and 15 percent.  The biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has risen around twentyfold since the start of the year, climbing from less than $1,000 to as high as $19,666 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday and to over $20,000 on other exchanges. But it has fallen each day since.    In the futures market, bitcoin one-month futures <0#XBT:> on Cboe Global Markets were earlier halted due to the steep price drop, while those trading on the CME hit the limit down threshold.  “The crypto markets have experienced several flash crashes over the past few years but we do believe there has been some overvaluation in the market, particularly over recent months,” said Jamie Burke, chief executive officer at venture capital firm Outlier Ventures.  “It’s much more likely this is a natural correction following over-exuberant market sentiment.”   On Friday, Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, told Bloomberg he had halted plans to launch a crypto-currency hedge fund. (bloom.bg/2BA9gGN)  “We didn’t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing,” he told Bloomberg.   His Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15, but he called clients on Dec. 12 and told them he had changed his mind, Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg.  Novogratz told Reuters in November he hoped to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.  Warnings about the risks of investing in the unregulated market have increased - Denmark’s central bank governor called it a “deadly” gamble - and there have been worries about the security of exchanges on which cryptocurrencies are bought and sold.   South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit said on Tuesday it is shutting down and is filing for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the second time this year.   Coinbase, a U.S. company that runs one of the biggest exchanges and provides digital “wallets” for storing bitcoins, said on Wednesday it would investigate accusations of insider trading, following a sharp rise in the price of a bitcoin spin-off hours before it announced support for it.  On Friday, Coinbase said it had temporarily suspended buying and selling of bitcoin due to high traffic.  CRYPTO-RIVALS   As some rival cryptocurrencies slid along with bitcoin, the total estimated value of the crypto market fell to as low as $440 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap, having neared $650 billion just a day earlier.   But other cryptocurrencies rose this week, with investors moving into cheaper digital coins, rather than cashing out of the sector.   Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market size, soared to almost $900 earlier in the week, from around $500 a week earlier. Ripple, the third-biggest, has more than quadrupled in price since Monday.   Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for retail FX broker Oanda in Singapore, said there had also been moves out of bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash, a clone of the original cryptocurrency. Oanda does not handle trading in bitcoin.  “Most of it is unsophisticated retail traders getting burned badly,” Innes said on bitcoin’s recent retreat.  While some say the launch by CME and its rival Cboe Global Markets of bitcoin futures over the last two weeks has given the digital currency some perceived legitimacy, many policymakers remain skeptical.  Bitcoin is known to go through wild swings. In November, it tumbled almost 30 percent in four days from $7,888 to $5,555. In September, it fell 40 percent from $4,979 to $2,972.

To tap in to the rapidly rising investor interest, Chicago-based derivatives exchange CBOE Global Markets began futures trading in bitcoins on Sunday, while the CME Group is expected to launch its contracts on Dec. 17 .   But Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe said it was hard to see bitcoins being used for everyday transactions.  “When thought of purely as a payment instrument, it seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions,” Lowe said in the speech titled “An eAUD?”   “The value of bitcoin is very volatile, the number of payments that can currently be handled is very low, there are governance problems, the transaction cost involved in making a payment with bitcoin is very high and the estimates of the electricity used in the process of mining the coins are staggering.”  The comments come days after his New Zealand counterpart said bitcoin appeared to be a “classic case” of a bubble, and cast doubt on its future.  “Bitcoin is to me very much like gold,” Grant Spencer, acting governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, told a local television program. “It’s mined, it has a fixed quantity and the price is very volatile.”  “I think a cryptocurrency that has a more stable value will be the sort of cryptocurrency that is more useful for the future,” Spencer said.   “I think they are part of the future.

Lowe noted the form that money takes has come a long way from clam shells, stones and even rum to metal coins and paper banknotes, and expects this innovation to continue.   The RBA itself is open to the idea of issuing a new form of digital money, perhaps using distributed ledger technology on which bitcoins function.   But the case for doing that has not yet been established, Lowe said, adding the central bank has no immediate plans to issue an electronic form of Australian dollar banknotes, or eAUDs.    “The history of private issuance is one of periodic panic and instability,” he added.   “In times of uncertainty and stress, people don’t want to hold privately issued fiat money. This is one reason why today physical banknotes are backed by central banks.”   The RBA is in close contact with its peers in other countries about introducing digital money.

608,"Bitcoin boss Karpeles easily led, not dishonest: mother",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA3K01J20140421,"April 21, 2014 05:04am EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"PARIS (Reuters) - Mark Karpeles, CEO of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, was a bright child, but a poor student, a lousy communicator and “too conciliatory”, allowing others to take advantage of him, his mother Anne said in a telephone interview.  Speaking from her home in Switzerland last week, Anne, 57, said Karpeles was a “terrible” student, but was admitted to Mensa, a global society of those with a high IQ, as a teenager. He loved computing from a very early age.  Mt. Gox, at one point last year the world’s biggest exchange for the bitcoin digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in late February, blaming hacking of its computer system for the loss of bitcoins worth more than $450 million at today’s rates.  Recalling Karpeles’ early days in Dijon in the Burgundy region of France, his mother said: “Difficult, never. Too conciliatory for a few things. Someone who is extremely nice and who has a tendency to let himself get taken for a ride by others. People who took advantage of him, who asked him to do their homework.”  “He was a terrible student. Terrible. Most subjects didn’t interest him. He took a Mensa test, passed it and was admitted into Mensa ... during his teenage years. Prodigies understand things straight away, but you don’t learn without repetition, without exercises. But that he didn’t understand,” she said.  Mensa didn’t respond to Reuters requests for confirmation of Karpeles’ membership.  Slipping between calling her son Mark, and his family name of Robert, Anne recalled his difficult childhood, saying she herself came from a family she described as “vertical”.  “My grandmother lived alone, my mother lived alone and I lived alone. My son was born into a single-parent home. My mother was someone who was pretty harsh and difficult ... for all sorts of reasons,” she said.  A young Karpeles was shuffled from school to school. At one, Anne said, “he had big problems with the teacher. Robert didn’t get along with her at all.”  “I tried to do as best I could my job as a mother. I tried to open the most doors I could for him, introducing him to drawing, music, cookery, sewing and also computing, because I love computing.”  “Computing was his thing. We began programming in BASIC on our little Sinclair (computer). This was around when he was 5 or 6. He loved it,” she said.  “He didn’t go to university. He failed badly in his second-last year of high school and decided to quit. I told him that if he was going to do that he should become a plumber, so he got an electrician’s diploma. Then one day, I saw him walking around with a huge book, called “PHP”. He told me he had become a doctor in PHP,” a computer programming language.  After a brief, unsuccessful attempt to set up a server company in Israel - “the electricity grid was bombed and the power was out for days,” she recalled - Karpeles joined a software distribution firm called Nexway, was promoted and, in 2009, was offered a post in Japan.  “For him, it was the doorway to his dream, he adored Japan. When he was young and we were living in Paris we went regularly to exhibitions at the Japanese Cultural Center. He learned business Japanese before leaving.”  As mother and son drifted apart, Karpeles married without telling her and only let her know she was a grandmother after his son was born.  “(Mark’s) communication at a personal level is catastrophic. It’s always been difficult to get him to speak. We tried to get him to be more extrovert ... Sometimes I wonder whether it’s not some kind of trauma linked to my mother. I had the same problem when I was younger.”  “There have been psychological profiles of Mark ... when he was admitted to Mensa. Prodigy, that was clear. Sometimes his problems communicating were recognized and other times not, depending on the profiler,” she recalled.  The first Anne heard of the blowout at Mt. Gox was when a local reporter telephoned her. “I didn’t even know Mark was the boss,” she recalled. “I had to look it up on Wikipedia.”  “As I understand it, he was hacked. All the accounts were emptied. He’s in a situation like a bank director who’s suffered a hold-up.”  Mt. Gox now faces liquidation after a Tokyo court last week dismissed the company’s bid to resuscitate its business, and the court-appointed administrator said Karpeles is likely to be investigated for liability in the exchange’s collapse. Bitcoin investors in the United States have launched a class action lawsuit alleging possible fraud by Mt. Gox insiders, including Karpeles.  “I don’t understand (the fraud accusations). I would never say it’s unthinkable, but Mark is my son, and my job as a mother is to do what I can for my son. That said, if genuinely there was dishonesty, I will not cover for him.”  “That would shock me though because I’ve never seen him do anything dishonest. He has sometimes trusted in people who were dishonest.”  Asked about Karpeles’ own admission in a 2006 blog post that he had two computer fraud-related convictions before he was 21, she said: “No, no, I don’t think there was ever any conviction. I don’t know. There are maybe things he hid from me.”  Anne visited Karpeles in Japan, her first trip there, for 10 days from late-November last year, meeting his Japanese wife and their 2-year-old son Pierre.  “(The wife) has gone to Canada to live ... that didn’t really help Mark, with all that’s happening,” Anne said, though she said she has more contact today with the wife than she does with her son.  As the situation at Mt. Gox unraveled in early December, she recalled how Karpeles battled to counter a hacking attack on the exchange. “He had to create a program to fight the hack, and he succeeded. He spent practically all night at work.”  “I could have fired a cannon next to him and he wouldn’t have noticed. He was so serious, concentrated - unlike when he was a boy,” she said.

609,"Bitcoin zooms above $13,000 to record high on relentless demand",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E0094,"December 06, 2017 05:42pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin extended its rally on Wednesday, breaking above $13,000 to a record high despite questions about the cryptocurrency’s real value and worries about a dangerous bubble.  Bitcoin received a boost after Friday’s announcement by the main U.S. derivatives regulator that it would allow CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets to list bitcoin futures contracts.  The move opens the door to added regulation but also more mainstream adoption, as bitcoin futures and other derivatives would make it easier to trade the new asset class.  “Simply the perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.  Bitcoin’s ascent of over 10-fold from below $1,000 at the start of the year has drawn regulatory scrutiny around the world.   Some high profile individuals such as Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz have said the cryptocurrency should be outlawed.  “It took a long time to establish the methodology and the way bitcoin was traded. The original appeal came from the fact they were unregulated. However it’s clearly moved out of those shadows and into center stage,” said Mick McCarthy, CMC Markets’ chief market strategist in Sydney.  “We are in the throes of a bubble market, and one of the characteristics of a bubble market is that there is no way to know when the bubble will burst.”  The current craze for bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, have been likened by some to the 17th century Dutch tulip mania and more recently the dotcom bubble.  “If you look at this sort of pattern it has repeated itself many, many times. The only way it ends is when sentiment shifts and that’s a deeply unpredictable thing,” Cambridge Global Payments’ Schamotta said.  Bitcoin was up 12.42 percent at $13,127.01 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP after surging to the record peak of $13,127.01.  “There is a lot of money flowing into bitcoin right now, mostly motivated by “fear of missing out” and greed,” said Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong.

After a 45-day public comment period, the proposed rules face additional review and possible changes on the feedback before the state regulator finalizes them.  “We recognize that - as the first state to put forward specially tailored rules for virtual currency firms - continued public feedback will be an important part of finalizing this regulatory framework,” the state’s Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky said in a statement.  The department’s “BitLicenses” will be required for firms engaged in the following virtual currency businesses:  1. Receiving or transmitting virtual currency on behalf of consumers;  2. Securing, storing, or maintaining custody or control of such virtual currency on the behalf of customers;  3. Performing retail conversion services, including the conversion or exchange of fiat currency or other value into virtual currency, the conversion or exchange of virtual currency into fiat currency or other value, or the conversion or exchange of one form of virtual currency into another form of virtual currency;  4. Buying and selling virtual currency as a customer business (as distinct from personal use); or  5. Controlling, administering, or issuing a virtual currency.

611,Bitcoin hits all-time high as talk of U.S. ETF approval intensifies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GG108,"March 03, 2017 03:22pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin hit a record high on Friday on optimism about the approval of the first U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  “There’s one catalyst at the moment and that is the expectation that the Winklevoss Trust will be approved on the 11th of March. That’s the only game in town,” said Daniel Masters, portfolio manager of Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program.   Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have a pending application with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF, which was filed nearly four years ago. On March 11, the twins are expected to receive a final decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on whether they can list their ETF.  If approved by the SEC, this would be the first bitcoin ETF issued by a U.S. entity.  On Friday, bitcoin climbed to a record $1,298 on the BitStamp platform. Bitcoin last traded at $1,263.01, up nearly 5 percent on the day. So far this year, bitcoin has surged more than 30 percent.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for a central authority.  Darin Stanchfield, founder and chief executive officer of bitcoin wallet KeepKey, said the approval of the Winklevoss ETF would be a big boost to the market. “It should add a fair amount of liquidity to the bitcoin market,” added.  To date, there are two other bitcoin ETF applications with the SEC. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust, backed by early bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group, filed its application with the SEC in March last year.  SolidX Partners Inc, a U.S. technology company that provides blockchain services, also filed its ETF application in July of last year.  Bitcoin relies on so-called “mining” computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins.  Analysts said the groundwork for bitcoin gains was laid in July last year in a process called “halving,” where rewards offered to bitcoin miners shrink. That has constrained the supply of the digital currency.  Dan Morehead, chief executive officer at hedge fund Pantera Capital, said in his recent letter to investors that the bitcoin price moves in line with the currency’s use in transactions and both have risen sharply.   He sees the bitcoin price possibly rising to $2,288 by the end of the year.  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Sandra Maler",0.22310000000000002,0.04738636363636363
612,Exchange giant CME's bitcoin futures get tepid take-up in debut,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1EB04K,"December 18, 2017 09:28am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK/LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bitcoin futures got a muted reception after their debut on CME Group late on Sunday, with volumes in the tens of millions of dollars in the first 12 hours of trading, as warnings about the risks of bitcoin sounded ever louder.   The launch of futures by the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, and by its rival Chicago-based exchange Cboe Global Markets a week earlier, had been hailed by many as the moment that bitcoin reached the investment mainstream.   That view has helped send bitcoin soaring even higher than before in recent weeks: it is on track for its best monthly performance in more than four years, having almost doubled in price since the start of December, when it was trading at less than $10,000.   But trading volumes in the CME and Cboe futures have so far been modest.   A total of 751 contracts - each of them for five bitcoins - had been traded on CME’s January futures contract as of 1417 GMT, at $18,970 per contract, just over 13 hours after their introduction, making a total notional value of around $70 million.  On its contract’s debut on Dec. 10, the Cboe traded nearly 4,000 contracts - with a contract size of one bitcoin - during the full session. By the same time on Monday, 2,712 of Cboe’s January bitcoin future contracts had been traded, making a total of just over $50 million notionally.    That compares with notional daily trading volumes of up to $4 billion on BitMEX, a Hong-Kong-based trading platform specializing in bitcoin futures that offers investors up to 100 times leverage on their positions, and which has an initial margin requirement of just 1 percent.   The CME and Cboe futures’ requirements make them unattractive to many cryptocurrency traders. They can only be traded when the exchanges are open, they require initial margins of 35 to 45 percent, and deposits must be made in dollars rather than bitcoins.  “As a trader ... the problem you have with these futures exchanges is there’s T+2 (settlement), weekends they are closed, bank holidays they’re closed,” said Alistair Milne, founder and manager of the Altana Digital Currency Fund.   “We’re all laughing at it because you have to send slow fiat to a futures exchange to post collateral on an asset that may move on a Sunday and margin-call you. It’s slightly ludicrous.”    The CME bitcoin front-month futures contract opened higher at $20,650 but dropped 6 percent within the first half hour of trading.   The contract was last at $18,960, some way off the $19,500 reference price set by the exchange for the January contract.  The reference price, from which price limits are set, is $19,600 for the February contract, $19,700 for March and $19,900 for June, according to CME.  On Dec. 10,  Cboe Global Market saw the price of its bitcoin futures surge nearly 20 percent in its debut.  The week-old bitcoin futures contract at the Cboe was last trading at $18,750.  The “spot” price of bitcoin - the price at which is it currently changing hands - climbed to a record high of $19,666 on the Bitstamp exchange on Sunday, before the CME began trading its futures. It was trading around $1,000 below that on Monday at $18,500, down almost 3 percent on the day.   The launch of cash-settled bitcoin futures on regulated exchanges considered a major step in the digital currency’s path toward legitimacy, which should encourage the entry of big institutional investors, some say.   “This is a brand-new asset class and I think perhaps a lot of investors want to sit back and see how this plays out before dipping their toes in this market,” said Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, an investment firm that specializes in the space.   Some investors believe the CME bitcoin futures could attract more institutional demand because the final settlement price is culled from four exchanges: Bitstamp, itBit, Kraken and GDAX.   The Cboe futures contract is based on a closing auction price of bitcoin from the Gemini exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  But the velocity of bitcoin’s moves higher this year, with an almost twentyfold increase since the start of January, has also led to an increasing number of warnings about the dangers of investing in an immature, opaque and largely unregulated market.   Denmark’s central bank governor on Monday warned investors to steer clear of bitcoin, saying it was “deadly” and that it was not the responsibility of authorities to regulate the market.  On Sunday, France’s finance minister said his country would propose that the G20 group of major economies discuss regulation of bitcoin next year.  And UBS Chairman Axel Weber told Swiss newspaper NZZ over the weekend that bitcoin was neither valuable nor sustainable, and that he would welcome regulation.  Dutch bank ING said on Monday that once the current bitcoin hype was over, it would return to being a “niche product” used by “tech nerds”, those who want payments to be anonymous, and those worried about hyperinflation in their own currencies.   ING also said the fact that bitcoin’s software was open-source meant it was infinitely replicable, which could in the future see it lose out to other rival cryptocurrencies - of which there are currently more than 1,000.  Most of bitcoin’s biggest rivals were up slightly on Monday, adding to hefty gains last week. Its main rival, Ethereum, which surged more than 60 percent to under $750 between last Monday and Thursday, was close to that high at just below $740, according to trade website Coindesk.      The total market value of all cryptocurrencies, which only rose past half a trillion dollars for the first time last Wednesday, reached as high as $603 billion on Monday, according to industry website Coinmarketcap. That makes its “market cap” greater than that of either Facebook or Amazon.

613,"Bitcoin technology faces split, may create clone virtual currency",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1KM1RB,"July 31, 2017 06:59pm EDT","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s underlying software code could be split on Tuesday to create a clone called “Bitcoin Cash,” potentially providing a windfall for holders of the digital currency.  The initiative is being led by a small group of mostly China-based bitcoin miners - who get paid in the currency for contributing computing power to the bitcoin network - who are not happy with proposed improvements to the currency’s technology.   They have initiated what is known as a “fork” - where blockchain, a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions, splits into two potential paths - that is set to be activated on Aug. 1.  A fork, if it goes ahead, would be significant as it could create a new competitor for bitcoin, which remains the oldest and most valuable digital currency. It is not clear if the fork will happen and how much the new coin would be worth.  If the fork goes ahead on Tuesday, anyone owning bitcoins before the split will have access to an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash for free, which they will then be able to trade for fiat currencies - legal tender backed by an issuing government - or other digital currencies.   “This is somewhat like a stock split,” said Jeff Garzik, chief executive and co-founder of Bloq, a blockchain company. “You go to sleep with 100 bitcoins and wake up in the morning with 100 bitcoins plus 100 ‘Bitcoin Cash’, a new token.”   Bitcoin averted a split two weeks ago, when its software developers and miners agreed to implement a software upgrade called the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91.  BIP 91 was the first step toward a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin through software called SegWit2x, which would make the network faster at processing transactions, such as payments using the virtual currency.   The miners, a powerful segment of the bitcoin community, represent a network of computer operators who validate information on the blockchain. Since bitcoin is powered by open-source code, any group of coders can use it to create clone coins.   Futures of Bitcoin Cash are already trading on certain exchanges at around $282.40. Bitcoin traded at $2,806.27, according to coinmarketcap.com.  If the fork goes ahead, users will only be able to receive and sell the new token on certain digital currency exchanges and digital wallet providers, as several have decided not to support it, including Coinbase, BitMEX, and Bitstamp.   “We do not want to support any behavior whereby anyone can potentially split the bitcoin blockchain and effectively create free money out of nothing,” said Greg Dwyer, head of business development at BitMEX.  Two other large exchanges, Kraken and Bitfinex, said they will allow users to trade Bitcoin Cash and will credit them with the same amount of the new token after the fork, if it goes ahead.

614,Factbox - Things you might not know about bubbly bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DT30L,"November 29, 2017 04:06pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin blasted past $11,000 (8,205 pounds) to hit a record high for the sixth day in a row on Wednesday after gaining more than $1,000 in just 12 hours, stoking concerns that a rapidly swelling bubble could be set to burst in spectacular fashion.  Here are some facts that you might not know about the largest and best-known cryptocurrency.   Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million - a number that is expected to be reached around the year 2140. So far, around 16.7 million bitcoins have been released into the system, with 12.5 new ones released roughly every 10 minutes via a process called “mining”, in which a global network of computers competes to solve complex algorithms in reward for the new bitcoins.   These mining computers require a vast amount of energy to run. A recent estimate by tech news site Motherboard put the energy cost of a single bitcoin transaction at 215 kilowatt-hours, assuming that there are around 300,000 bitcoin transactions per day. That’s almost enough energy as the average American household consumes in a whole week.   Bitcoin’s smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin, making it worth around $0.0001 at current exchange rates.   Bitcoin has performed better than every central-bank-issued currency in every year since 2011 except for 2014, when it performed worse than any traditional currency. So far in 2017, it is up around 1000 percent. If you had bought $1,000 of bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it, you would now be sitting on $80 million. Many people consider bitcoin to be more of a speculative instrument than a currency, because of its volatility, increasingly high transaction fees, and the fact that relatively few merchants accept it.   More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, either by hackers or insiders. That’s a total of more than $10 billion at current exchange rates. Few have been recovered.  Despite many attempts to find the creator of bitcoin, and a number of claims, we still do not know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or was. Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur Craig Wright convinced some prominent members of the bitcoin community that he was Nakamoto in May 2016, but he then refused to provide the evidence that most of the community said was necessary. It is not clear whether Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym, was a name used by a group of developers or by one individual. Nor is it clear that Nakamoto is still alive - the late computer scientist Hal Finney’s name is sometimes put forward. Developer Nick Szabo has denied claims that he is Nakamoto, as has tech entrepreneur Elon Musk more recently.   Until earlier this year, it was thought that Chinese exchanges accounted for around 90 percent of trading volume. But it has become clear that some exchanges inflated their volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of bitcoin back and forth between accounts. Since the Chinese authorities imposed transaction fees, Chinese trading volumes have fallen sharply, and now represent less than 20 percent, according to data from website Bitcoinity.  The total value of all bitcoins released into the system so far has now reached as high as $190 billion. That makes its total value - sometimes dubbed its “market cap” - greater than that of Disney, and bigger than the market cap of BlackRock and Goldman Sachs combined.   CRYPTO-RIVALS  Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency. There are now well over 1,000 rivals, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.   It is already possible to short bitcoin on a number of retail platforms and exchanges, via contracts for difference (CFDs), leveraged-up margin trading or by borrowing bitcoin from exchanges without leverage. But a number of big financial institutions - including CME Group, CBOE and Nasdaq - have recently announced that they will offer bitcoin futures, which will open up the possibility of shorting the cryptocurrency to the mainstream professional investment universe.

Bitcoin experts cited a statement on the Linux Foundation website, signed by several high-profile bitcoin entrepreneurs and developers who had backed the plan, that said the “Segwit2x” upgrade would be scrapped for now as it could “divide the community”.  The upgrade would have changed bitcoin’s rules in a so-called “fork”, effectively cloning the existing bitcoin to create another cryptocurrency.  “Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin,” the statement, authored by Mike Belshe, CEO of blockchain security firm BitGo, said. “Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together.”  Reuters could not immediately verify the origin of the statement.  Bitcoin surged from just below $7,500 to a new record high of $7,888 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange in the 20 minutes that followed the statement’s release.  “The 2x fork is dead.

The cryptocurrency, which trades 24 hours a day and seven days a week, climbed as high as $11,799.99 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange at around 2100 GMT on Sunday.  It was not clear what caused the move higher over the weekend other than new investors joining the upstart market, with so-called wallet-providers reporting record numbers of sign-ups over the past week.  Analysts said Friday’s announcement by the main U.S. derivatives regulator that it would allow CME Group Inc and CBOE Global Markets to list bitcoin futures contracts had turned sentiment positive after a choppy week.  “The price rises are triggered by continued media interest driven by the expectation of futures trading on CME,” Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, said.  By 1230 GMT on Monday, bitcoin had slipped back to around $11,250, still up more than 100 percent over the past three weeks. Sunday’s high marked a 1,121 percent increase since the start of the year.  Think Markets analyst Naeem Aslam said reports Britain wants to increase regulation of bitcoin and other digital currencies by expanding the reach of European Union anti-money-laundering rules that force traders to disclose their identities and report suspicious activity, had knocked bitcoin off its highs.  But others said greater regulatory scrutiny would help.  “If anything, regulation will only increase bitcoin’s rate of growth as regulation lends credibility and engenders trust,” Nicholas Gregory, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency firm CommerceBlock, said.  Sunday’s record high for bitcoin came as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the launch of the “petro”, which he said would be a cryptocurrency backed by oil reserves, to shore up a collapsed economy.  Opposition leaders said the digital currency would need congressional approval and some cast doubt on whether it would ever see the light of day in the midst of turmoil.

It then edged back up to trade at around $9,400 in the hour that followed, still down roughly 4 percent on the day. (Graphic: Bitcoin searches exceeds that of Trump - reut.rs/2zSavA6)      One market-watcher attributed the fall to outages in bitcoin exchanges and the heavy price surge of recent times.   “Naturally a few of the early bitcoin traders are taking some profits off the table,” said Charles Hayter, founder of CryptoCompare.com.  “Volatility is in the market at the moment and that means both positive and negative moves.”   The latest fall has tempered an astronomical rise for the cryptocurrency in recent months - bitcoin was up almost 1,100 percent year-to-date on Wednesday. As of 1500 GMT on Thursday, it was still up around 880 percent.  The rise has been fueled by signs that the digital currency is slowly gaining traction in the mainstream investment world, as well as by increasing awareness.   In the past week, Google searches for “bitcoin” exceeded searches for “Trump” for the first time, data from Google showed, even though U.S. President Donald Trump has been prominently in the news this week.      Several large market exchanges including Nasdaq, CBOE Holdings and CME Group — the world’s largest derivatives exchange — have said they are planning to provide futures contracts based on bitcoin.   Some investors have said such a development may prompt them to add the digital currency to their portfolio.   In October, Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said he was keeping an open mind on bitcoin following a media that the investment bank was exploring a new trading operation dedicated to cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin’s rapid ascent has prompted warnings from a stream of prominent investors that it had reached bubble territory, while the Bank of England deputy governor on Wednesday said investors should “do their homework” before investing in the digital currency.          New users of bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent weeks, along with the cryptocurrency’s own rise.   London-based Blockchain.info, one of the biggest global bitcoin wallet-providers, told Reuters on Wednesday it had added a record number of new users on Tuesday, with more than 100,000 customers signing up, taking the total number to more than 19 million.      The evidence suggests that few of the users are buying bitcoin to use it as a means of exchange, but are speculating to increase their capital.  Bitcoin’s fall on Thursday dragged down the prices of other cryptocurrencies in its wake, with Ethereum, bitcoin’s biggest rival, falling as much as 19 percent on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.    For the month, bitcoin is still on track for a more than 40 percent price increase.  Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Jemima Kelly and Gareth Jones",0.11155714285714284,0.0880209120685311

Bitcoin was last down around 3.4 percent at $9,612.60 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, from a record peak of $11,395 set on Wednesday. On Thursday, it went as low as $9,000. BTC=BTSP.   The latest slide has tempered an astronomical rise in recent months: Bitcoin had jumped almost 1,100 percent year-to-date on Wednesday. As of 0200 GMT, it was still up around 915 percent.  One wealth manager said technical chart analysis was predicting deeper falls.   “A correction could bring bitcoin back to its previous level of chart support of around $7,500. That’s over a 20 percent drop from its current price,” said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth.   “Without everyday utility, pure speculation is driving prices at the moment. Traders are forced to use technical indicators to make buy and sell decisions.”  Despite its massive fall this week, bitcoin still ended November 54.6 percent higher, its best monthly performance since a near 66 percent gain in August.  The cryptocurrency has posted monthly losses only three times in 2017.   Bitcoin’s rise has been fueled by signs that the digital currency is slowly gaining traction in the mainstream investment world, as well as by increasing public awareness.

Bitcoin’s rapid ascent has prompted warnings from a streamof prominent investors that it had reached bubble territory.  The deputy governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday said investors should “do their homework” before investing in the digital currency.  Bitcoin investments are seen as mere speculation because demand has skyrocketed without fundamentals backing the cryptocurrency, said Jin Yong-jae, a Seoul-based economist at HI Investment & Securities.   That has made the price of bitcoin “very much volatile,” Jin added.  “There are people who invest in bitcoin for its future value, but most seem to be just jumping on the bandwagon, without being fully aware of the structure or how it will replace actual currencies in the future.”  Others are unfazed by talks of a bubble, though, predicting still further gains.  “The number of bitcoins that can be mined is limited to 21 million, of which 16.5 million bitcoins are already in circulation,” said Siddharth Agarwal, lead financial analyst at research firm GlobalData.   “As bitcoin mining becomes increasingly difficult, this could further drive bitcoin prices upwards.”  Reporting by Swati Pandey; Additional reporting by Dahee Kim in SEOUL and Abhinav Ramnarayan in LONDON; Editing by Kim Coghill",0.08857619047619049,0.0191761148904006

622,Factbox: Things you might not know about bubbly bitcoin,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DT30B,"November 29, 2017 02:23pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin blasted past $11,000 to hit a record high for the sixth day in a row on Wednesday after gaining more than $1,000 in just 12 hours, stoking concerns that a rapidly swelling bubble could be set to burst in spectacular fashion.  Here are some facts that you might not know about the largest and best-known cryptocurrency.   Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21 million - a number that is expected to be reached around the year 2140. So far, around 16.7 million bitcoins have been released into the system, with 12.5 new ones released roughly every 10 minutes via a process called “mining”, in which a global network of computers competes to solve complex algorithms in reward for the new bitcoins.   These mining computers require a vast amount of energy to run. A recent estimate by tech news site Motherboard put the energy cost of a single bitcoin transaction at 215 kilowatt-hours, assuming that there are around 300,000 bitcoin transactions per day. That’s almost enough energy as the average American household consumes in a whole week.   Bitcoin’s smallest unit is a Satoshi, named after the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin, making it worth around $0.0001 at current exchange rates.   Bitcoin has performed better than every central-bank-issued currency in every year since 2011 except for 2014, when it performed worse than any traditional currency. So far in 2017, it is up around 1000 percent. If you had bought $1,000 of bitcoin at the start of 2013 and had never sold any of it, you would now be sitting on $80 million. Many people consider bitcoin to be more of a speculative instrument than a currency, because of its volatility, increasingly high transaction fees, and the fact that relatively few merchants accept it.   More than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges, either by hackers or insiders. That’s a total of more than $10 billion at current exchange rates. Few have been recovered.  Despite many attempts to find the creator of bitcoin, and a number of claims, we still do not know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or was. Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur Craig Wright convinced some prominent members of the bitcoin community that he was Nakamoto in May 2016, but he then refused to provide the evidence that most of the community said was necessary. It is not clear whether Satoshi Nakamoto, assumed to be a pseudonym, was a name used by a group of developers or by one individual. Nor is it clear that Nakamoto is still alive - the late computer scientist Hal Finney’s name is sometimes put forward. Developer Nick Szabo has denied claims that he is Nakamoto, as has tech entrepreneur Elon Musk more recently.   Until earlier this year, it was thought that Chinese exchanges accounted for around 90 percent of trading volume. But it has become clear that some exchanges inflated their volumes through so-called wash trades, repeatedly trading nominal amounts of bitcoin back and forth between accounts. Since the Chinese authorities imposed transaction fees, Chinese trading volumes have fallen sharply, and now represent less than 20 percent, according to data from website Bitcoinity.  The total value of all bitcoins released into the system so far has now reached as high as $190 billion. That makes its total value - sometimes dubbed its “market cap” - greater than that of Disney, and bigger than the market cap of BlackRock and Goldman Sachs combined.   CRYPTO-RIVALS  Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency. There are now well over 1,000 rivals, according to trade website Coinmarketcap.   It is already possible to short bitcoin on a number of retail platforms and exchanges, via contracts for difference (CFDs), leveraged-up margin trading or by borrowing bitcoin from exchanges without leverage. But a number of big financial institutions - including CME Group, CBOE and Nasdaq - have recently announced that they will offer bitcoin futures, which will open up the possibility of shorting the cryptocurrency to the mainstream professional investment universe.

623,"Bitcoin to start futures trading, stoking Wild West worries",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1E10J7,"December 07, 2017 12:45pm EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin fans are salivating over the potential of long-awaited legitimacy for the cyptocurrency when futures trading launches this weekend, but experts worry the risks associated with bitcoin’s Wild West-like nature could overshadow the debut.  The first bitcoin future trades kick off Sunday at 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Cboe Global Markets Inc’s CBOE.O Cboe Futures Exchange, followed a week later by CME Group Inc’s (CME.O) CME.   Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) plans to get into the mix next year, Reuters reported.  While Cboe, CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments, the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with crypto-exchanges lacking even basic oversight.  That has stoked fears of market manipulation, inaccurate pricing and systemic risk to clearing houses.   “I’m kind of taken aback by what’s happened in the last three months,” said Richard Johnson, an analyst at Greenwich Associates who owns digital currencies and considers himself a bitcoin bull. “I’m concerned things are moving a bit too quickly.”    Some of the world’s largest brokers on Thursday voiced concerns about the process through which bitcoin futures had come to market, noting that market participants should have been better consulted on issues such as margin levels and trading limits.   Through an open letter to the U.S. derivatives watchdog from the Futures Industry Association, the brokers said more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin’s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the underlying spot market.   “We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based,” the FIA letter said.    Bitcoin’s more than 10-fold upsurge this year has led to warnings of a bubble by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who called it “a fraud” that will eventually blow up. Others, like Wall Street adviser Tom Lee, expect bitcoin to top $100,000.  On Thursday, its hypervolatility was on full display as it broke through $15,000 for the first time on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BTSP, jumping more than 12 percent from the previous day.. Since August 2011, bitcoin has averaged a daily price change of nearly 3 percent, up or down, compared with a daily average change in the U.S. dollar-euro cross rate EUR= of less than 0.5 percent since the euro's debut in 1999.  “Maybe it’s just the most unique market that is going to continue to go up forever and ever and so everybody on the long side is going to make money and it’s a great thing, but I’ve been around long enough to know that’s not going to work out so well,” said John Lothian, CEO of advisory firm John J Lothian and Company.  As a virtual currency, bitcoin can be used to move money around the world without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government, which is a double-edged sword, said Steve Grob, director of group strategy at Fidessa.  “There is no backstop. If suddenly tomorrow everyone decided bitcoin was worthless, it would be worthless, and I’m not sure whether people have really thought that one through,” he said.  Traditional banks remain skeptical of dealing with bitcoin exchanges. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) stopped processing wire transfers for an exchange called Bitfinex, leaving customers unable to transfer U.S. dollars out of their accounts, except through special arrangement with the exchange’s lawyer.   Still, new entrants, from retail investors to high-frequency traders, have piled into bitcoin. U.S.-based crypto-exchange Coinbase said it added 100,000 accounts in the three days around the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, for 13.1 million overall.   If the futures market were to exceed the size of the spot market, with current daily trading volume of around $6 billion per day, the underlying price could be more susceptible to manipulation, said Kevin Zhou, co-founder of crypto currency fund Galois Capital.  “You’ve seen these problems before in bitcoin futures, where right before the settlement, the price pegs it high or low and then bounces back right after,” he said.  (GRAPHIC: Bitcoin price hits record high - reut.rs/2AL7Ubh)  As volumes increase, there are also questions about the robustness of the technology at bitcoin exchanges, Lothian said.  “Particularly when you’re talking about a high-frequency approach to this where people are trying to arb multiple exchanges.”  Last month, the Gemini bitcoin exchange, which will set the price for Cboe’s futures contract, and GDAX and Kraken, two of the four exchanges in CME’s bitcoin index, had systems issues.    “Every single bitcoin exchange receives and is receiving complaints by users due to the unbelievably surging bitcoin price and the result that has on capacity,” Christina Yee, a Kraken representative, recently told Reuters in an email.  Kraken is planning to launch a new trade engine “soon” which should increase the exchange’s capacity, Yee said.  The volatile nature of bitcoin could also present a risk to clearing houses, said Thomas Peterffy, CEO of Interactive Brokers Group Inc IBKR.O.  Clearing houses act as a middlemen between the parties to futures transactions. If there were a wild price swing in bitcoin and a smaller brokerage failed to meet its margin call, the clearing house would have to take over the position, further moving the price of bitcoin, which could cause other brokers to fail, Peterffy said.   “If that happens at a time when bitcoin spikes up for whatever crazy reason, there could be an avalanche,” he said.  Questions like these have kept some futures market operators on the sidelines, for now. Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N), owner of the New York Stock Exchange and ICE Futures U.S., opted not to join CME and Cboe in the race to be first with a bitcoin future.  “We didn’t think it was obvious to rush out a product and be first and settle against an index on a lot of exchanges that are not particularly transparent,” ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said this week at a Goldman Sachs conference.

Bitcoin’s price has soared tenfold this year, prompting many market participants to warn of a bubble as it topped $11,000 for the first time last week.  Bitcoin futures and other derivatives would make it easier for more investors and speculators to trade the new asset class.

(reut.rs/2BvXvwu)  CME’s bitcoin futures contract launches Dec. 18, available for trading on the CME Globex electronic trading platform, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange said on Friday.    Cboe and CME were given approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to list bitcoin futures on Friday after the rival bourses were able to show that their proposals met the necessary regulatory requirements.    The exchanges also had to agree to work together to monitor for manipulation, flash rallies, trading outages and other structural problems in the largely unregulated bitcoin cash market.  Once liquidity builds in the Cboe bitcoin futures contract and the exchanges are able to show how their oversight of the underlying market works, Cboe plans to reapply with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a bitcoin ETF, Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly said in an interview on Friday.  So far, the SEC has not allowed bitcoin-based ETFs on the CBOE or elsewhere, partly because of concerns around the unregulated aspect of bitcoin.    To help guard against excessive volatility, both Cboe and CME plan to have intraday price limits and initial margin rates of 30 and 35 percent respectively.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, with a vertiginous sevenfold increase in value since the start of the year that has led to many warnings the bitcoin market - now worth well over $100 billion - has become a bubble that is about to burst.   It reached a record high of $7,888 around 1800 GMT on Wednesday after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” was suspended.   But it has quickly retreated from that peak, falling to as low as $6,718 around 1330 GMT on Friday. It later recovered a touch to trade around $6,880 by 1645 GMT, but that was still down almost 4 percent on the day.   “Bitcoin is all ups and downs,” said Thomas Bertani, chief executive of Eidoo, a cryptocurrency wallet provider that recently became the first startup in the space to take out a full-page advert in the Wall Street Journal newspaper.   “The market realized that the price rise was an over-reaching, so people started selling... (and) there are many long and short positions that amplify price movements.”   As bitcoin tumbled, Bitcoin Cash, which was generated from another software split on Aug.1, surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day to around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.   Bitcoin Cash’s transactions are processed in so-called “blocks” that are larger in capacity than bitcoin’s, so can therefore in theory allow for more transactions to be processed at any given time, making transaction fees much cheaper.   The fork that had been planned for next week, known as “SegWit2x”, had also intended to increase the capacity of the blocks, and could thus have reduced fees for bitcoin transactions.   Any investors, therefore, that see bitcoin more as a currency than a store of value might be choosing to buy into Bitcoin Cash now that Segwit2x had been scrapped, Bertani said.   “People who had been supporting Segwit2x could as an alternative move to Bitcoin Cash,” he said.   “There are good reasons to believe that Bitcoin Cash could be an alternative for people who believe that low fees on bitcoin transactions are needed today.”   Reporting by Jemima Kelly, editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise",0.0847076923076923,0.16788461538461538

Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), told the Calcalist business conference he will bring the proposal to the ISA board next week. If approved, it would be subject to a public hearing and then the TASE bylaws would need to be amended.  “If we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended,” Hauser said, adding the ISA must find the appropriate regulation for such companies.  Bitcoin plunged by 30 percent to below $12,000 on Friday as investors dumped the cryptocurrency after its sharp rise to nearly $20,000. It recouped some losses to trade above $14,000 on the Bitstamp platform, down 9 percent on the day.  “We feel that the prices of bitcoin behave like bubbles and we don’t want investors to be subject to that volatility and uncertainty,” Hauser said. “There is an importance to signal to the market where things are... Investors should know where we stand.”  Earlier this month, Hauser had said bitcoin-based companies would not be included in TASE indexes and that there was a need for a suitable regulatory framework for such instruments given that the global market value of all digital currencies grew in 2017 to $300 billion from $18 billion.  The proposal will likely be the last for Hauser, who will step down next month after 6-1/2 years as ISA chief.  “But once it’s on its way it will continue to be pursued,” said Hauser, who will be replaced by Anat Guetta.  He said he hopes she will promote easing capital gains taxes and focus on regulatory enforcement. (Editing by Peter Graff)",0.08616428571428572,0.00011904761904761734

633,Bitcoin slides by over $1000 in less than 48 hours,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1NG4CA,"November 10, 2017 07:22am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Bitcoin dropped below $7,000 on Friday to trade more than 5 percent down on the day, having fallen by well over $1,000 since hitting an all-time high on Wednesday.  Bitcoin dropped to $6,800 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange by 1200 GMT, before recovering a little to $6,870 just over 20 minutes later.  On Wednesday around 1800 GMT, it had touched $7,888 after a software upgrade planned for next week that could have split the cryptocurrency in two was suspended.  As bitcoin fell, Bitcoin Cash - a clone of the original that was generated from another split on Aug.1 - surged, trading up as much as 35 percent on the day at around $850, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.  Despite losing almost 7 percent this week, bitcoin is still up more than 600 percent so far this year.

634,"After bitcoin’s wild week, traders brace for futures launch",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1O81KG,"December 10, 2017 01:00am EST","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The newest way to bet on bitcoin, the cyptocurrency that has taken Wall Street by storm with its stratospheric price rise and wild daily gyrations, will arrive on Sunday when bitcoin futures start trading.  The first bitcoin future trades are set to kick off at 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Cboe Global Markets Inc’s Cboe Futures Exchange.  The launch has given an extra kick to the cyptocurrency’s scorching run this year. It has nearly doubled in price since the start of December, but recent days saw sharp moves in both directions, with bitcoin losing almost a fifth of its value on Friday after surging more than 40 percent in the previous 48 hours.  But while some market participants are excited about a regulated way to bet on or hedge against moves in bitcoin, others caution that risks remain for investors and possibly even the clearing organizations underpinning the trades.  The futures are cash-settled contracts based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  “The pretty sharp rise we have seen in bitcoin in just the last couple of weeks has probably been driven by optimism ahead of the futures launch,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.  Bitcoin fans appear excited about the prospect of an exchange-listed and regulated product and the ability to bet on its price swings without having to sign up for a digital wallet.  The futures are an alternative to a largely unregulated spot market underpinned by cryptocurrency exchanges that have been plagued by cybersecurity and fraud issues.  “You are going to open up the market to a whole lot of people who aren’t currently in bitcoin,” Frederick said.  The futures launch has so far received a mixed reception from big U.S. banks and brokerages.  Interactive Brokers plans to offer its customers access to the first bitcoin futures when trading goes live, but bars clients from assuming short positions and has margin requirements of at least 50 percent.  Several online brokerages including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade will not allow the trading of the newly launched futures from day one.  Some of the big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, will not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients, the Financial Times reported on Friday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Thursday said it is planning to clear bitcoin futures for certain clients.  Bitcoin’s manic run-up this year has boosted volatility far in excess of other asset classes. The launch of futures may help dampen some of the sharp moves, analysts said.  “Hypothetically, volatility over the long run should drop after institutions get involved,” said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories.  “But there may not be an immediate impact, say in the first month,” he said.  The launch futures on an underlying spot market can lend more order to spot trading in the long run, by facilitating better price discovery and directional bets, not just long bets, J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago, said.  Analysts, however, warn that much of how the futures market will react is a mystery, given that bitcoin is unlike any other asset.  “This is completely unknown territory,” said Charles Schwab’s Frederick.  Fears of inaccurate pricing and systemic risk to clearing houses should prices move sharply and clients fail to meet margin calls remain. Brokers have said that more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin’s high volatility.  For a factbox on the launch of bitcoin futures contracts, see:  The risk of market participants manipulating the underlying spot market to their benefit in the futures market is another big concern.  “Large equity indexes show some volatility around cash settlements and those are in highly liquid, highly regulated venues,” said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group Inc in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “Compare that to cash settlement in bitcoin, and there is a lot more uncertainty on how that would play out.”  Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Additional reporting by Chuck
