0,Bitcoin mining ban considered by China's economic planner,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47867031,2019-04-09 11:30:37+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin creation has joined a list of activities facing a ban in China. A notice published online in Mandarin by the country's economic planning agency added ""virtual currency mining activities [including] the production process of Bitcoin"" to a list of industries that could be shut down. The suggestion is that the power consumed by the industry contributes to pollution and wastes resources. The Chinese public has been invited to comment until 7 May. The National Development and Reform Commission has not said when the suggested ban might be introduced. Bitcoin mining involves carrying out computer processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify cryptocurrency transactions. As an incentive to take part, the owners of the equipment that is first to solve a puzzle are rewarded with a batch of newly created bitcoins.  The complexity of the tasks is adjusted to ensure each block of transactions is processed on a regular basis - approximately once every 10 minutes on average. As a consequence, the more computers that compete, the harder the puzzles are made, which in turn means a greater amount of electricity is required to power them. Some of the world's biggest cryptocurrency mining operations - known as farms - are based in China. Concerns about them have previously been raised in the country's state-controlled media. The Xinhua news agency reported in October about a study that suggested related carbon dioxide emissions could feed into global warming, and increase temperatures by two degrees Celsius as soon as 2033. The news service has also reported on hundreds of mining computers being seized by the authorities following claims they were responsible for abnormal electricity consumption, threatening the smooth running of local power grids. Last year, one of the country's regulators - the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation - called on local governments to direct mining companies to make an ""orderly exit"" from the market. Chinese regulators have also taken other action against the industry, closing Bitcoin exchanges and banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) as part of a digital currency crackdown in 2017. The National Development and Reform Commission's intervention appears to have had little effect on the value of Bitcoin. Its notice was published on Monday, since when one bitcoin has continued to trade for above $5,000 (£3,820) - its highest level since November 2018.",0.011217647058823528,-0.017770350564468216
1,Binance exchange hackers steal bitcoins worth $41m,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48199375,2019-05-08 09:06:05+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Hackers have stolen $41m (£31m) worth of Bitcoin in a major crypto-currency heist. The Binance exchange, which stores Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies for members, said hackers took 7,000 bitcoins in one go. Withdrawals have now been suspended on the platform. ""We beg for your understanding in this difficult situation,"" Binance said. However, the exchange said it would replace the lost cash with the help of its emergency insurance fund. According to Binance, the attackers used a variety of techniques to break in. They deployed viruses and used phishing attacks to get security information. This eventually allowed them to access the exchange's ""hot wallet"", an online cache of bitcoins readily available for customer transactions. The hot wallet contained about 2% of Binance's total crypto-currency assets. Other wallets were ""secure and unharmed"", the firm said. The hackers ""had the patience to wait"" and acquire access to a number of accounts before withdrawing the huge haul of bitcoins, according to Binance. ""It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed,"" the company's statement read. ""Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system.  ""We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that."" Now, the ability to withdraw funds from the exchange has been disabled and may not be restored until next week. In a live video chat, Binance's chief executive Changpeng Zhao sought to answer questions about the hack. ""I haven't really slept much for the last 29 hours,"" he said. ""To be honest I don't feel that well… it's not a great day."" However, he told Binance users that he and his colleagues were working to secure the exchange and prevent any further hacks. And he added that he was asking other exchanges to block bitcoins associated with the hacked wallet from being transferred elsewhere, which would render them largely useless. While Binance is one of the largest crypto-currency exchanges, the heist is not the largest the Bitcoin world has seen.  In 2014, Mt Gox was hacked to the tune of $470m. ""Blockchain businesses will need to implement controls more commonly seen in the traditional banking sector if they are to win over consumers,"" said cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House.  ""Cyber-insurance is a common necessity today as identify theft, malware and cyber-attacks are frequently being performed against high-value blockchain and crypto-currency companies.""

2,Bitcoin: Crypto investors 'think they can get rich quick',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47483068,2019-03-07 15:17:03+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Investors influenced by friends and social media celebrities are buying Bitcoin and other cryptoassets in an attempt to ""get rich quick"". But many are putting in their money, with no protection against losses, without fully understanding what they are doing. The findings are in research published by the Financial Conduct Authority. Huge volatility has led to warnings about investing in crypto. One industry group has called for regulation.  A heavily-promoted industry in cryptoassets has built up in recent years, with Bitcoin the most popular.  Despite the hype, very few people actually put their money into this kind of unregulated investment, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's research. Its findings suggested: ""Despite this lack of understanding, the cryptoasset owners interviewed were often looking for ways to 'get rich quick' citing friends, acquaintances and social media influencers as key motivations for buying cryptoassets,"" the FCA said. Huge volatility in these investments have led to warnings across the world of the risks involved. ""Cryptoassets are complex, volatile products - consumers investing in them should be prepared to lose all of their money,"" said Christopher Woolard, of the FCA. However, the FCA concluded that - with relatively small sums involved - the overall scale of harm from volatility in value might not have been as high as previously feared. Owing to the lack of regulation, there is no compensation or protection for investors if things go wrong. Last year, the Treasury Committee of MPs said that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were a ""Wild West industry"" which needed to be regulated to protect investors. It said that risks of hacking and money-laundering were also concerns. CryptoUK, which was set up last year as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, agreed that there should be official oversight. ""CryptoUK has consistently argued that cryptocurrency investment should be regulated in the UK, to provide greater certainty and to adequately protect consumers,"" said Iqbal Gandham, who chairs the group.  ""We are pleased that the government agrees with our approach, and are actively working alongside the FCA and Treasury to help deliver a proportionate and well-designed UK regulatory regime which matches the best of other jurisdictions across the globe.""",0.10198235294117645,0.11131535947712419
3,Fake BBC News page used to promote Bitcoin-themed scheme,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46905475,2019-01-17 13:29:32+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"An investment scheme is using a fake BBC News webpage to convince members of the public to hand over funds. The spoof page references a Bitcoin-themed documentary broadcast by Panorama last year, but links on the page direct visitors to a site promising to make them a millionaire. Reports indicate that the fake page is being spread via emails sent from hacked accounts. A spokesman for the BBC said it is looking into how best to respond. The Financial Conduct Authority has previously issued a warning about an earlier scheme run under the same Bitcoin Trader branding that features in the latest effort. This is not the first time an attempt has been made to link the brand to the BBC. Last year, adverts appeared on social media and elsewhere falsely claiming that a trading platform operating under the same name had been backed by several of Dragons' Den's stars.  Two of the show's entrepreneurs - Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones - subsequently issued denials. Ads also claimed that Lord Alan Sugar had quit The Apprentice to help promote its software, leading the businessman to tweet that he had contacted the police. In addition, the former BBC journalist Martin Lewis - who now runs the MoneySavingExpert site - launched legal action against Facebook after it failed to remove fake ads suggesting he was also involved.  And Sir Richard Branson has also warned that fake CNN news pages had been created to make it seem that he had endorsed a Bitcoin Trader-branded scheme. It is not, however, clear whether the people behind the effort are the same as before. The fake BBC News page contains a lengthy article describing an ""underground banking system"" that allows investors to turn small deposits into ""a fortune"". It presents a case study of one individual who supposedly saw an investment of less than £300 grow into nearly £900,000. At the bottom of the page, a countdown clock indicates that there is little time remaining to enrol in the venture. City of London Police's cyber-crime team has previously warned users against this tactic. ""Always be wary if you're pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true,"" it said when it discussed the con last April. One of the indications the latest bogus webpage is fake is its address, which does not correspond to the bbc.co.uk or bbc.com domains used by the broadcaster. One cyber-security expert said members of the public who receive emails urging them to click any link with an unusual address should in general be cautious of doing so. ""If you are suspicious of any email, search for the page or website in Google rather than clicking the link,"" suggested Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security. ""And if you receive the email at work, let your IT team know so they can deal with it appropriately.""   ",-0.04285714285714286,-0.007658730158730156

The fall brought the total value of all Bitcoin in existence to below $87bn. On Thursday, 15 November, Bitcoin Cash - an offshoot of Bitcoin - split into two different crypto-currencies, which are now in competition with each other. And some observers have blamed this for creating turmoil in the crypto-currency markets, with many of the digital assets experiencing falls. Bitcoin exchange Kraken said in a blog post that it regarded one of the two new Bitcoin Cash crypto-currencies - Bitcoin SV - as ""an extremely risky investment"". Bitcoin is a notoriously volatile crypto-currency. At its peak, in November 2017, it briefly hit $19,783 - which means the price has fallen by about 75%. After the excitements of last year when the price soared to nearly $20,000 and then tumbled, Bitcoin has been rather dull and stable for much of 2018, settling between $6,000 and $7,000.  Sceptics like the economist Nouriel Roubini have predicted its demise, while the ""hodlers"" - those who promise to hold it come what may - remained confident it was heading ""to the moon"" where they would drive their ""lambos"". (That's- Lamborghinis for the uninitiated.) Now it is tumbling again and while it is never safe to ascribe any one cause to a market movement, bitter rifts in the community around a Bitcoin variant appear to be to blame. Bitcoin Cash split off from Bitcoin last year after a dispute about its direction and split again a few days ago in another so-called hard fork.  Its value has dropped by almost 50% over the last week. It's confusing but think of the People's Front of Judea versus the Judean People's Front and you will get the picture. The result is gloom right across the cryptocurrency sector with its many altcoins. We were told that the fact that there was a strict limit of 21 million bitcoins which could be mined guaranteed that this would be a strong and stable currency.  What nobody seemed to reckon with was that if you could start one cryptocurrency you could start dozens and chaos might then ensue.",-0.0696125,0.05982311958874459

The Met Police, which investigated the case, said detectives could ""only identify one possible reason"" for the Swedish national's actions. He had emailed the company, Cryptopay, in August 2017, to ask that he be sent a new password. Cryptopay, however, refused, saying this contravened its privacy policy. Jermu Michael Salonen, 43, has been sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison at Stockholm District Court. He faced a number of charges, including some for sending a white powder to Swedish lawmakers - among them, the prime minister - in 2017. Salonen had addressed a padded envelope containing the device to two Cryptopay employees. It was delivered at some point in November 2017 to an office in Hackney, which had housed an accountancy firm previously used by Cryptopay. Several months later, on 8 March 2018, a worker at the office began opening the package but did not continue when they became suspicious of what was inside. ""We are relieved that no one from The Accountancy Cloud team was hurt in this incident,"" a spokesman for Cryptopay told the BBC. ""None of our employees have ever worked at that address."" ""The vast majority of our employees work remotely across Europe, but we are implementing additional security measures to prevent any potential harm to our employees anyway.  ""We are thankful for both British and Swedish police, who were able to investigate the case with outstanding professionalism."" ""It was due to sheer luck that the recipient ripped opened the package in the middle rather than using the envelope flap which would have activated the device,"" said Commander Clarke Jarrett at the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command. DNA found in the package did not match information on UK databases, so it was analysed by Interpol.  ""Through these inquiries, it was identified that the DNA matched those of Salonen, who was known to Swedish authorities,"" the Met says.

6,'Wild West' Bitcoin 'should be regulated',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45558593,2018-09-18 23:15:10+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin and other digital currencies are a ""Wild West industry"" and need to be regulated to protect investors, a committee of MPs has urged. Problems include volatile prices, minimal consumer protection and risks of hacking and money-laundering, says the Treasury Committee. The committee said there were no well-functioning crypto-currencies and preferred to call them ""crypto-assets"". It urged City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise them. At present, the FCA has no power to regulate either the issuers of these assets or the exchanges on which they are traded. ""Crypto-asset investors are currently afforded very little protection from the litany of risks. Namely, there are no formal mechanisms for consumer redress, nor compensation,"" said the committee.  There are now more than 1,500 varieties of crypto-asset being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world.  Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017, the price of a Bitcoin rocketed to nearly £15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months.  Crypto-fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have posed challenges for regulators around the world. ""As the government and regulators decide whether the current Wild West situation is allowed to continue, or whether they are going to introduce regulation, consumers remain unprotected,"" said the Treasury Committee.  Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""It's unsustainable for the government and regulators to bumble along issuing feeble warnings to potential investors, yet refrain from acting.  ""At a minimum, regulation should address consumer protection and anti-money-laundering."" CryptoUK, which was set up in February as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, said it welcomed the Treasury Committee's recommendations. Iqbal Gandham, who chairs it, said: ""Self-regulation by the industry was always intended to be a starting point - this must now be matched by government action.  ""Regulatory oversight is essential to ensuring consumer safety, guarding against malpractice and providing much needed clarity to an industry that is fast maturing.  ""It is therefore pleasing that the committee has endorsed our suggestion on how this can be delivered, by bringing responsibility within the FCA's perimeter of oversight.""

The Tesla chief indicated the safety precaution was prompted by a tweet he had sent asking: ""Wanna buy some Bitcoin?"" Several fake accounts have previously used images of Mr Musk and variations of his name to promote cryptocurrency scams, sometimes within replies to his posts. Twitter declined to comment. ""For privacy and security reasons, we don't comment on individual accounts,"" explained a spokeswoman. However, the BBC understands that the account was locked down rather than ""blocked"". Mr Musk's suspect tweet had featured an anime drawing of a girl wearing Bitcoin-themed clothing. The Japanese art form is a current interest of the entrepreneur, who recently commented on his love for the movies Your Name and Princess Mononoke. Mr Musk is far from being the only celebrity whose identity has been spoofed by those seeking publicity for dubious crypto-offers. Others include: In some cases, accounts are first registered to an unrelated name that gains a Twitter-verified tick only to have their image and username changed afterwards to impersonate a famous figure. Cyber-security firm Duo Lab published a report in August detailing how software tools known as ""bots"" are being used to automate such scams. It said that they had avoided detection by taking steps such as making minor edits to the stolen profile images. Mr Musk has previously complained about the phenomenon, and sought help to ""get rid of the annoying scam spammers"" from Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin. Mr Palmer suggested the social network needed to find a way to automatically weed out such posts, and others have also urged it to be more proactive in tackling the problem. ""We are proactively tackling so-called cryptocurrency scams on the platform,"" a spokeswoman for Twitter told the BBC. ""In the last week alone, user impressions have fallen by a multiple of 10, a significant improvement on previous action rates.""

German broadcaster SWR says ecstasy pills and Colombian cocaine were advertised on the platform, with purity grades and various amounts on offer. Cocaine was offered at prices from €42 per gram, while hashish was sold for €11 per gram.  Investigators found a notice on the platform warning that sales of weapons or sex abuse images were prohibited.

The announcement followed the release of evidence by a group of security researchers showing the wallet being compromised. However, Mr McAfee maintains that the claim stands. Bitfi had offered a $250,000 (£190,000) reward to anyone who hacked the wallet. But it stated that the Bitcoin inside must be removed from the wallet - which was  controversial among the cybersecurity community as often weaknesses are identified but not acted upon. The group claimed to have hacked the wallet once before but Bitfi and Mr McAfee refused to accept their evidence. They said it didn't qualify for the reward - known as a bug bounty - because none of the digital currency was actually removed.  Security researchers had argued that the terms of the bug bounty programme were too specific. ""Effective immediately, we are closing the current bug bounty programs which have caused understandable anger and frustration among researchers,"" the firm wrote in a statement. It said it planned a bigger announcement in the coming days. John McAfee, however, maintained on Twitter that the $120 wallet, which is designed to hold any form of crypto currency, is ""clearly unhackable"" in response to a question from a follower. The group of security researchers who carried out the hack included Prof Alan Woodward, cybersecurity expert at Surrey University. ""Security can be complex and the wider public rely upon vendors telling the truth,"" he said. ""However, there are certain signals that should immediately ring alarm bells. The worst is if a vendor claims something is unhackable as Bitfi did: nothing is unhackable."" The wallet works by creating a virtual key based on two pieces of information - a made-up phrase - on the website it suggests something like ""10 Scary Things My Doctor Is Not Telling Me"" and a second piece of data such as a phone number or email address to ensure that each combination of the two - the private key - is unique. Bitfi says that this key is not stored anywhere, including on the device itself, but this was disputed by the security researchers who say they were able to find it, using what is known as a cold boot attack, where electronic information can be recovered from memory long after it has been entered.",0.008612500000000002,0.028822544642857148

In January, a Bitcoin mining computer labelled Kodak KashMiner was on display on Kodak's official stand at the CES technology show in Las Vegas. But critics said the advertised profits were unachievable and misleading. Now the company behind the scheme says it will not go ahead. Kodak told the BBC it was never officially licensed. Halston Mikail, chief executive of Spotlite USA, which licenses the Kodak brand for various products, rejected the critics' description of the scheme as a ""scam"". As to the decision not to proceed with the scheme, Mr Mikail said that this was driven by the fact that the ""price of Bitcoin has dropped therefore offering hashpower as an investment opportunity is not a viable business opportunity"".  Spotlite USA is one of many companies that licenses the Kodak brand to put on its own products. It showed off a Bitcoin-mining computer labelled Kodak KashMiner in January and told the BBC that it planned to let people rent the machines. To mine crypto-currency, computers are tasked with solving complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions. Successful miners are rewarded with bitcoins for their efforts. Spotlite planned to let people pay an up-front fee of around $3,400 (£2,500) to rent a KashMiner, and would let customers keep a cut of any bitcoins generated. Mr Mikail detailed plans to install hundreds of the devices at the Kodak headquarters in Rochester, New York, to take advantage of cheap electricity offered by an on-site power plant. He said 80 devices were already in operation. But Kodak told the BBC that no devices had been installed. In its promotional material, Spotlite said an up-front investment of $3,400 would generate earnings of $375 a month for two years by mining Bitcoin. However, critics said the promised profits did not take into account that mining Bitcoin is becoming increasingly difficult. Writer and sceptic David Gerard called it a ""crypto-currency folly"", suggesting the scheme never went beyond its unfinished website. ""There is no way your magical Kodak miner will make the same $375 every month,"" wrote economist Saifedean Ammous, who pointed out that anybody taking the gamble would have made a loss on their investment. In a phone call with the BBC, Mr Mikail said the company would instead run its mining operation privately with equipment installed in Iceland, instead of renting capacity to consumers. A spokesman for Kodak told the BBC: ""While you saw units at CES from our licensee Spotlite, the KashMiner is not a Kodak brand licensed product. Units were not installed at our headquarters."" Mr Mikail disputes the first part of this statement saying that at a minimum he had the right to sell KashMiner-branded hardware.",-0.04974090909090909,0.0661353797717434
11,Kenyan crypto-currency pioneer: 'I make my money from Bitcoin and tasty roast meat',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45889707,2018-10-22 01:22:49+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The towering vista of Mount Kenya provides an unlikely backdrop to a tech-savvy Kenyan restaurant that has embraced crypto-currencies as a form of payment.  Betty's Place specialises in ""nyama choma"", a lip-smacking goat meat barbeque that is a firm favourite amongst Kenyans.  Located in the rural town of Nyeri, about 150km (90 miles) outside the capital, Nairobi, it is one of the few businesses in the country that allows customers to pay with not one but two crypto-currencies - Bitcoin and Dash. ""Since the world is becoming more global, my place is also becoming a global restaurant,"" says Beatrice Wambugu, the owner of the restaurant.  ""I attract different customers from different parts of the world, whichever coin they have. As long as it's a viable coin we accept it."" Ms Wambugu started trading in Bitcoin two years ago and and within a year she made enough money to buy the two-storey Nyeri hotel, which she converted to Betty's Place. Located on Nyeri town's busy main road, the restaurant is unmistakable with its bright mustard-coloured walls and big glass windows providing a welcome invitation to hungry patrons, who are greeted by a pleasant aroma of meat on the grill and the sounds of local music. Betty's Place is not only a place for tasty Kenyan cuisine, but it has become something of a local attraction for people wanting to know more about Bitcoin. When it comes to embracing new technology, Ms Wambugu describes herself as ""a crypto-currency pioneer"".  However, her payments in Bitcoin have been modest - about 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£230, $300) in sales from about 20 people. To encourage more take up, she holds classes in how to trade in Bitcoin every Sunday at her restaurant. ""I've set aside one day where I can teach my customers. Whoever asks about crypto-currencies: 'How does it work? What is Bitcoin?' I train them,"" she says. Mobile phones make paying with crypto-currency at Betty's Place and other retailers easy. In Africa the mobile phone has been instrumental in transforming the way people conduct business, and the growth of Bitcoin could one day rival mobile banking platforms like M-Pesa as a viable form of payment.  Bitcoin presents an ""opportunity to do what people are calling 'banking the unbanked'"", says James Preston, head of the publication SA Crypto, referring to more than 350 million Africans who do not have access to traditional forms of banking.  ""There's been such a history of poverty in Africa that so many rural communities are yet to be developed with normal banking infrastructure,""  he told the BBC. ""Now all of a sudden they can get a Bitcoin wallet on their phone and in essence they can have a bank in their phone, and that's what crypto-currencies and crypto assets do, they allow you to be your own bank,"" he told the BBC. The surge in popularity of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies has led many experts to believe that Africa will once again leapfrog the digital divide, bypassing traditional banking much like it did with the fixed-line telephone.  According to the African Development Bank, smart phone penetration is set to hit 50% by 2020.  Yet even in the famed Kenyan tech hub of ""Silicon Savannah"" there are few if any businesses that allow customers to buy with Bitcoin - and there are cautionary tales.  Smart Money is the new BBC weekly business programme for Africa Look out for it on partner stations from 22 October. Peter Oduba, a would-be investor from Kenya, fell for a Bitcoin Ponzi scam called Crypto Wealth and lost a significant amount of money in the process. He told the BBC the scam had involved ""six pots"" investors could ""jump into"". ""The first pot when you get in, you have to bring two people, then those two people bring in another two,"" he explained.  ""Once the other two bring more people it means you have like seven or eight people, which means once you have seven people, someone has to jump to the next pot.  ""They were saying once you jump to pot number two they will give you some money in Bitcoin. We didn't know it was a scam, and we did it for quite some time and then it just collapsed."" Bitcoins, and the blockchain technology that underpins crypto-currencies, are often touted as presenting an opportunity to transform business and the way governments run in Africa.  Transparency and accountability are key aspects of the blockchain system - two qualities citizens seek in African countries that have been mired in corruption and maladministration. Pan-African telecommunications company Liquid Telecom said in its blockchain report this year, that the technology was a ""truth engine that represents a new opportunity to improve processes and drive efficiency"".  If all government contracts, tenders and budgets were available in an incorruptible blockchain network there would be an exponential decline in corrupt practices and shady deals.  But it is important to note that blockchain technology is not the panacea to the governance problems seen in parts of Africa. ""Blockchain is no magic wand,"" said Carlos Santiso, who heads the Innovation in Citizen Services Division of the Inter-American Development Bank.  ""It will not replace the need for stronger institutions and, in fact, it can be most effective when strengthening them.""  Much of the appeal of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies for investors is that they are free from the strictures of regulatory authorities, partly because legislation has not caught up with the technology yet. South Africa's central bank trialled a system earlier this year called Project Khokha, which used blockchain technology, to process interbank payments and settlements.  It found that ""the typical daily volume of the South African payments system could be processed in less than two hours"" with full confidentiality of transactions assured. In Nigeria - home to the continent's largest Bitcoin market with more than $4m-worth traded daily - regulators have taken a much stronger stance than their South African counterparts.  Earlier this year, the country's Senate ordered an investigation into Bitcoin trading and central bank governor Godwin Emefiele warned: ""Crypto-currency or Bitcoin is like a gamble, and there is a need for everybody to be careful."" Business instinct and pioneering endeavour has led Ms Wambugu to invest in Bitcoin and make it a payment alternative for her customers. She does not need regulators to tell her how to best use the technology. Betty's Place is at the confluence of traditional food and modernity in a rural setting, and that is exactly how Ms Wambugu wants it to be. ""At my place, it's 'nyama choma' and 'nyama Bitcoin',"" she added.",0.2047731707317073,0.10845132509766656

Serejgs Teresko, 31, was kidnapped from a rented Virginia Water home in April 2017, where police found a large cannabis factory.  He turned up later and a search found a crypto currency wallet used to access a Bitcoin account in his Cobham home. He was jailed for nine years and three months for money laundering and drugs offences. Teresko had admitted money laundering, cultivation of cannabis and the possession/control of articles for use in fraud at Kingston Crown Court on 6 October.  Surrey Police said it was the first UK law enforcement agency to convert Bitcoin into Sterling and confiscate the money. Unlike the notes or coins Bitcoin largely exists online. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers stored in a Bitcoin wallet. There is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity.  Source: BBC News In April 2017 Teresko's partner and members of the public reported a man being ""bundled into car"" from a Virginia Water home which was found to contain a ""large and sophisticated cannabis factory"", Surrey Police said. At his Cobham home they found cash in various currencies worth almost £263,000.  Teresko contacted police the following day to say he was fine, but refused to explain what had happened. Following his arrest police found a keepkey device on which was stored £1.2 million worth of Bitcoin. They also discovered a number of bank and credit cards in multiple names, counterfeit European identity cards, expensive clothes, watches, jewellery and gold bars.  Police were given permission by the Crown Prosecution Service to convert the Bitcoin into Sterling and confiscate it under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  On Thursday, a judge at Kingston Crown Court found Teresko had benefited from his criminal activity to the tune of £2 million and must forfeit nearly £1.45 million including the value of the Bitcoin. The total value of the confiscation order was £1,447,935.70. He must also pay an additional £13,150 within three months or face another 10 years in jail. Det Insp Matthew Durkin said: ""It appears Teresko was a member of an organised crime group and Bitcoin was one of the methods he chose to launder criminal assets.""",-0.081885,0.042083333333333334
13,Bitcoin buster? The search for a more stable cryptocurrency,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45245149,2018-08-20 23:15:59+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Cryptocurrencies - digital tokens known as cryptos for short - have investors in the grip of a gold rush fever, with billions being traded every day. Prices fluctuate wildly, making them high-risk investments. But could a more stable, less volatile crypto persuade us to think of digital money less as a speculative investment and more as a mainstream ""smart"" currency? There are now more than 1,500 cryptos - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin to name just a few - being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world.  Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017 the price of a bitcoin rocketed to nearly £15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. It's currently worth about £5,000. This volatility may be a speculative trader's friend, but it has reinforced cryptos' reputation for being high-risk investments for the adrenalin-fuelled ""get rich quick"" brigade.  Crypto fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have alarmed regulators around the world. So a growing number of crypto start-ups are developing alternatives known as stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to traditional fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound or Japanese yen, with the aim of reducing this volatility and increasing confidence. Hong Kong-based Tether has blazed a trail in this market, swapping about $2.7bn (£2.1bn) worth of fiat currency into its eponymous digital tokens. It claims to have all its digital tethers backed by traditional money in its bank accounts - a claim that has been disputed by some. But Tether's 90% dominance of the stablecoin market is enticing several others to try something similar.  For example, crypto finance company Circle is launching a new token called USD Coin. ""Imagine a US dollar coin that you can make payments with, use on crypto networks, or use in smart contracts to pay dividends, but which you can convert back to fiat currency at any time,"" explains Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire. Circle's USD Coin will run on the Ethereum blockchain - the distributed ledger technology underlying cryptos - and have an open standard infrastructure overseen by a body called Centre. It wants Centre to become the main platform for other stablecoin operators.  ""Crypto represents the next layer of infrastructure for the internet,"" he says. ""It will allow money to move at the speed of light around the world for free, but also offer binding, verifiable contracts, enabling anyone to do business together. ""We're going to see a lot of businesses using tokens for revenue raising. And eventually central banks will want to do this,"" maintains Mr Allaire. Circle, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs and Baidu and has an estimated value of close to $3bn, recently attracted another $110m in investment led by investors such as Chinese crypto mining giant Bitmain.  Kory Hoang is the founder of Stably, a firm in Vancouver that is developing StableUSD, another US dollar-backed stablecoin. The Vietnam-born entrepreneur believes the sector presents ""a huge opportunity"", especially for people in countries with unstable currencies. ""Fruit sellers on the streets in Zimbabwe could accept your digital payment via an app,"" he says. ""Their fiat money is almost worthless, but they could receive tokens in seconds and sell them very easily for a small commission."" Obi Nwosu, founder and chief executive of Coinfloor, a crypto exchange collective, says: ""There are about two billion people who are unbanked or underbanked, which means they have no access to the world of e-commerce.  ""Bitcoin and cryptos give these people access at much lower cost, but admittedly with less protection."" But there is disagreement within the industry about the best way to reduce the price volatility of cryptos. Coinfloor hopes to solve the volatility issue by attracting far more money into the sector in the belief that greater trading volumes will lead to a more efficient market.   This will require better regulation, argues Mr Nwosu, before large institutions are likely to commit serious money. Concerns about the abuse of cryptos for money laundering and terrorist financing remain a barrier to mass acceptance, he says. But this is still better than going down the stablecoin route, he believes, which requires a central organisation to back the digital tokens, with the extra cost this entails. And this structure conflicts with the decentralised nature of cryptos and blockchain technology and could be ""the worst of both worlds"", he says. ""We think that although stablecoins could be popular in the short run, a decentralised currency that is stable and doesn't have a central organisation behind it will be safer in the long run."" Whatever the disagreements about how to achieve price stability for currency and investment purposes, most people in the sector agree that a crypto's additional ability to act as a smart contract presents huge opportunities to ""tokenise"" physical assets. ""Say I have a house in downtown Saigon worth $1m,"" says Mr Hoang. ""I could tokenise it and sell those tokens on the global crypto market. You could issue a billion pieces of your house if you wanted. Then people would start trading them, just like shares in a real estate investment trust. ""It gives investors around the world access to investment opportunities they never had before."" Akbar Thobani, chief executive of crypto trading platform SFOX, says: ""We think that tokenising assets, such as trucks, cars, planes and real estate, will become big business.""  But if stablecoin cryptos do become as mainstream as fiat currencies, will the system be able to cope with the volume?  Many fear blockchain is getting slower and in danger of seizing up altogether. Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, is only able to process about 13 transactions a second, whereas card payment processing platform Visa can cope with more than 20,000 transactions a second.   This is why work is afoot to create more flexible blockchain-based platforms, such as EOS and Stellar, that could cope with a vast increase in transaction volume and millions more users.",0.1571794871794872,0.07156901740235073

The price fell to $5,947.40 (£4,256.44) on Tuesday, according to a price index run by news website Coindesk. Bitcoin reached its peak in November, when it hit $19,000, and then began to fall steadily from mid-December.  The latest fall comes a day after several major US and UK banks banned customers from using credit cards to purchase the digital currency.  Tightening legislation in several countries appears to have shaken confidence in crypto-currencies. As of Tuesday: The assets later stage a partial recovery, with Bitcoin rising to about $7,418 before falling back again. Chinese state media is reporting that China will soon take steps to prevent investors from accessing foreign virtual currency exchanges, although it is not clear how the government intends to achieve this.  China and South Korea have already banned initial coin offerings, while Japan and Australia have taken steps to tighten Bitcoin regulations.  The US is likely to follow suit - on Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) testified before the Senate regarding digital currencies. The SEC's chairman Jay Clayton said that his agency was already able to police initial coin offerings. But he added: ""We are open to exploring with Congress, as well as with out federal and state colleagues, whether increased federal regulation of crypto-currency trading platforms is necessary or appropriate."" While not banning crypto-currencies, the financial regulators in both the UK and France have warned investors that they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by companies, known as ""initial coin offerings"". Besides legislation, virtual currencies have been dogged by criminals seeking to hack wallet services to steal users' funds.

15,Why are Venezuelans seeking refuge in crypto-currencies?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47553048,2019-03-19 00:05:37+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Crypto-currencies have faced a lot of criticism since Bitcoin first came on the scene 10 years ago. But for one group of people, they're proving very useful.  Venezuela has seen its currency rendered practically valueless after suffering one of the worst periods of hyperinflation since World War Two. A cup of coffee now costs 2,800 bolivars (21p; 28 cents), up from 0.75 bolivars 12 months ago - an increase of 373,233%, according to Bloomberg data. And that's after a 2018 devaluation that knocked five zeros off the currency. More than three million Venezuelans have left the country, as essential goods such as toilet paper and medicine have become unaffordable and crime has soared.  As a result, many are turning to digital assets such as Bitcoin as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolivar. And given how volatile Bitcoin is - its value has plunged from nearly £15,000 in 2017 to less than £3,000 now - it's an indication of just how desperate people have become. Even the government has launched its own crypto-currency, the Petro, supposedly backed by oil, to provide a solution to the economic crisis.  But critics say it is a sham and there is no evidence of anyone using it.  Eli Meregote, 28, has been using Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as a way of sending money home from Colombia where he now lives and works, avoiding the fees usually associated with money transfer services such as Western Union. ""I first discovered crypto in 2017 when I lost my job in Venezuela,"" the CCTV technician says. ""Even if I had my job, it would've been useless anyway, because the minimum wage was $4 a month."" Cryptos offered him ""total control"" of his money ""without banks or third parties"", he says. ""With Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, I can send money home faster and without obstacles."" Bitcoin was designed to be a global, digital currency that governments and banks couldn't interfere with. Like many other crypto-currencies it works by recording all transactions permanently on a distributed ledger called the blockchain.  Critics say Bitcoin and other cryptos - there are more than 1,600 globally - are unstable, use too much energy, and are used by money launderers or those wanting to buy illicit goods on the web.  But for Venezuelans, storing their money in a digital wallet in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash or any of the others, is still a better option than holding on to the national currency.   Adoption has rocketed, with trading volumes on Localbitcoins.com - a person-to-person Bitcoin trading platform - rivalling those of the US. Although trading volumes dipped in March due to a power cut that plunged the country into darkness for days, February saw trading levels reach £6.84m ($8.76m) per week and nearly £1m per day, according to crypto-currency data tracker Coin Dance.  ""Many Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value,"" says economist Asdrubal Oliveros of Caracas-based consultancy Econanalitica. ""It is practically a vehicle for buying foreign currency and to conserve value, as it is relatively easy and you can keep small amounts which do not involve large investments.""   Mr Oliveros points out that in Venezuela many people work as freelancers, receiving their pay in bitcoin since in most cases they do not have accounts abroad that allow them to make transfers in dollars. ""Receiving payments in bolivars does not make much sense,"" he says.  Matt Aaron, who manages the Venezuela arm of Bitcoin.com, the crypto-currency news and trading platform, says: ""We pay our team members in Caracas in Bitcoin Cash. Transactions are instant and cost less than a cent to make."" Ricardo Carrasco, 29, an IT engineer who is paid in bitcoin, is a fan of the crypto-currency.   ""It has given me access to the financial world outside Venezuela,"" he says. ""We are not free to exchange our currency for US dollars or any other currency. We don't have access to the banking services of the world, so crypto allows you to bypass those barriers."" Mr Carrasco sells small amounts of Bitcoin on Localbitcoins.com and other exchanges, and receives money in bolivars to his Venezuelan account. He is then able to buy goods with his card as and when he needs to.  ""It is a pretty simple, straightforward process,"" he says. But Venezuela's government is intervening, recently launching a remittance service that caps the amount of crypto-currency someone inside the country can receive. It has started earning commissions from the transactions.  More Technology of Business One thing is certain: despite the Bitcoin crash and loss in value of other crypto-currencies, Venezuelans have more interest in digital assets than ever before.  In the Colombian border town of Cucuta, which sees tens of thousands of fleeing Venezuelans arrive every day, a new crypto-currency cash machine (ATM) was opened in March.  It is designed to make carrying funds safer and more convenient.  ""With the ATM, Venezuelans can receive bitcoin from anywhere in the world and cash out in Colombian pesos right away,"" says Matias Goldenhörn from Athena, the company that installed the machine.  ""A Venezuelan family of four, getting on a bus in Cucuta to emigrate to Argentina, was carrying all their life savings in cash on their 14-day bus journey,"" he recalls.  ""They just exchanged all the money into bitcoin and, once they arrived at their final destination, sold the crypto for the local currency, hence not risking travelling with the money on them. ""It made life a lot easier for them."" At least there is one country in the world where Bitcoin is serving a practical value for ordinary citizens rather than speculators.

16,What is Bitcoin?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42150512,2017-12-11 10:37:26+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The value of digital currency Bitcoin is making headlines again. Amid volatile trade in November and December, it hit a peak of more than $17,000 at one point - a staggering rise, given that it started the year at $1,000. So what exactly is Bitcoin, and what's behind the buying frenzy? There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online. Although there are some specialist ATMs which issue bitcoins, it may be best to think of them as being more like virtual tokens. And secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. That means it is ""not legal tender, you can't pay your taxes or use it to settle debts"", says Dr Garrick Hileman of the Judge Business School at University of Cambridge. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There's a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for. No one is entirely sure. Some say it's a classic economic bubble: frenzied investors paying far more for an asset than it's worth for fear of missing out. They put it in the same bracket as the mania for Dutch tulip bulbs in the 1630s or internet companies in the dot.com boom.  Others point to the growing prospect of Bitcoin crossing over into the financial mainstream.  ""Speculation is a big part of this, but there are signs of growing use,"" says Dr Hileman.  He says there were between three and six million people around the world actively using crypto-currency in April.  ""Today it's probably closer to 10 to 20 million, so it's a very quickly growing user base,"" he says. That's the equivalent of a population the size of the Netherlands or Chile. There has also been a boost by some large financial institutions, like the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, getting into the space, he adds. There are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers. This acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. There is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity. Bitcoin wallets store the addresses and are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately-run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. Increasingly, users are often asked for ID to open a wallet. The rules underpinning Bitcoin say that only 21 million bitcoins can be created - and that figure is getting ever nearer. It is unclear what will happen to the value of bitcoins when that limit is reached. The anonymity afforded by digital currencies has attracted people wanting to make illegal purchases on the internet.   However, a small but growing number of recognised businesses now allow customers to buy goods and services with Bitcoin.  They range from multinational firms like Microsoft and travel booking site Expedia, through to small businesses using it as something of a novelty, such as a sushi restaurant in Cambridge or an art gallery in London.  It is not the same as established currencies, like the US dollar, which can be used across the world to buy a coffee or pay for a hotel room. A 900% rise in one year for a traditional currency would have major repercussions for consumers' spending power and the businesses that accept it. But many Bitcoin owners don't use it to buy things. ""The vast majority of users - I would estimate upwards of 80% or 90% - get into the space for investment reasons,"" says Dr Hileman. ""So you see the term 'crypto-asset' being used to describe Bitcoin more than 'crypto-currency' these days.""  At the moment Bitcoin is largely unregulated, says Bradley Rice, an expert in financial regulation at the law firm Ashurst. It has been widely used on the dark web, which cannot be accessed via a normal internet browser without using a workaround. There are also concerns about its volatility. The chart below compares Bitcoin to the pound and euro. All the values start at 100 to compare the currencies more clearly.  Because of Bitcoin's much faster growth, the chart uses a different approach on the y-axis where the smaller the gap, the faster the increase. China and South Korea have serious worries. They have banned the launch of new virtual currencies via so-called ""initial coin offerings"" - where companies or individuals issue their own digital currencies for investors to buy - and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".  But the underlying technology of Bitcoin is regarded by some major financial institutions as bullet-proof. ""That's potentially why financial regulators [in Europe] are adopting largely a 'wait and see' approach,"" says Mr Rice. There is no shortage of financial journalists or experts saying Bitcoin's surge is a bubble.  ""There may be good reasons for buying bitcoin,"" an article in The Economist said recently. ""But the dominant reason at the moment is that it is rising in price."" Bitcoin has doubled in value in the space of a month - which has led some to argue it is too volatile to be seen as a currency, and warned that a crash is inevitable. However, Bitcoin has been ""declared dead"" a few times already, says Dr Hileman. ""It's shown some resilience and bounced back from some near-death experiences,"" he says. At the same time, many would agree this is ""very bubbly"", and he predicts we may see a ""spectacular crash again in the not-too-distant future"". ""So hang on tight if you are a holder of these currencies,"" he concludes. ",0.08228888888888891,0.05845638928972262
17,A new addiction: Could you be hooked on Bitcoin?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44289772,2018-05-29 13:06:48+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Experts in gambling addictions have identified a new ticking time bomb. The explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has created a new kind of addiction. A rehab clinic in the Scottish borders is now offering a treatment for digital money traders who cannot stop speculating within the unpredictable market. The rise of Bitcoin has combined with advances in technology allowing anyone to trade online. Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are bought and sold like shares, and traded globally. Their value also fluctuates like shares. Castle Craig Hospital in West Linton has been inundated with inquiries about helping people addicted to trading in the modern currency and is treating it in the same way as gambling addiction. Michael Parsons is a Bitcoin expert.  He told BBC Scotland's Stephen Jardine Programme why this modern activity has become addictive: ""I think because Bitcoin entered the mainstream last year and it went up ten times in value, people have a fear of missing out and want to jump in.  ""They are incorrectly looking at the historical rise of Bitcoin and think that will be repeated - which it may be or may not be - so they are buying purely on speculation and not on understanding."" He said the practice is based on hope - like putting money into a slot machine. ""Bitcoin has gone up ten times last year, over the last 12 months it's gone up 240%, in the last month it's gone down by 23% and today it went down almost 3% itself,"" he said. ""People are looking at the wild fluctuations and thinking they have to jump on the bandwagon and perhaps make some money out of it."" There are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known.  Bitcoin has no notes or coins: it is digital and largely exists online and it is not issued by governments or traditional banks. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. It was reported in January 2018 that the total value of all cryptocurrencies was almost £500bn It is estimated there are between 13 and 28 million active users of cryptocurrencies in the world today. Its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for. There is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity.  Bitcoin ""wallets"" operate like privately-run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.  The anonymity afforded by digital currencies has attracted people wanting to make illegal purchases on the internet. A growing number of businesses - including a property venture launched by Scots businesswoman Michelle Mone - now allow customers to buy goods and services with Bitcoin. The man who helps cryptocurrency addicts is Castle Craig therapist Chris Burn. He told BBC Scotland the attraction is the same as for those who are pulled into gambling: ""It is a kind of a bubble situation that is very exciting for people, particularly for compulsive gamblers, because excitement is a big part of any addiction. We see this as potentially large."" He said: ""You have the elements of poor regulation, an air of mystery about it, and the idea of gambling can seem a sort of noble thing to do.  ""That and the combination of potential huge gains is really attractive to a lot of people who would never dream of any other addictive activity.""  He says the gravity of this potential issue cannot be underestimated. ""This is an addiction and illness that causes a lot of people to end up in despair, even suicide, so it has to be taken very seriously and people need to take practical measures,"" he said. Chris explained the warning signs to look out for: ""They are quite obvious. You may be making a profit on your trading but if you are spending 16 hours a day staring at a computer you may be losing an awful lot of other elements in your life - friendships, work, exercise. You may be damaging yourself in ways you are not aware of. ""People can get extremely anxious and display physical symptoms - sweating, shaking, unable to sleep, really serious physical symptoms.""

But this year there is a question a select few should be asking themselves - have I profited from my investment in crypto-currencies? If you have, you could be liable for tax.  In 2014 Revenue & Customs published guidelines making clear the different taxes that apply to any earnings from crypto-currencies.  For most people who have bought a few bitcoins some years ago, it is Capital Gains Tax that will be relevant. This will apply to any profits, once you hit the £11,300 CGT threshold, not just if they are converted into a standard currency but if they are used to buy other crypto-currencies such as Ethereum or to invest in initial coin offerings (ICOs). But in recent weeks there is some evidence that a few people are making trading in crypto-currencies a full-time job, in which case they are likely to be liable for income tax on their earnings. Now, the acceleration in the value of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies happened over the course of 2017 so it is unlikely many people will have incurred tax liabilities in 2016-17, the year HMRC is currently examining. But over recent months there has been a flood of Bitcoin money heading into everything from ICOs to property - so next year there should in theory be a big boost for the government's Capital Gains Tax receipts.  One accountant told me plenty of his clients had piled into Bitcoin but seemed unaware of the tax implications.  What is clear is the whole crypto-currency industry is now under the spotlight of regulators around the world.  They are concerned not just about tax evasion but money laundering and major fraud.   In the United States this week the Securities and Exchange Commission got a court order to halt an ICO attempting to raise $1bn (£0.7bn) to fund what was claimed to be the world's first ""decentralised"" bank.  The regulator alleges this was a scam that had already used what it described as fraudulent tactics to raise as much as $600m, including failing to disclose the criminal background of key executives. AriseBank has blamed the dispute on ""confusion"" over its activities and crypto-currencies. Accountants have a warning for those who invest their crypto-currency gains in schemes that turn out to be fraudulent - if you lose your money, you won't even be able to write it off against tax.",-0.04930000000000001,0.09277777777777778

Sindri Thor Stefansson escaped the low-security prison through a window and fled to Sweden on a passenger plane that was also carrying Iceland's prime minister, local media report. The ticket had another man's name and he was identified through CCTV video. The stolen computers, which are still missing, are worth $2m (£1.45m). Mr Stefansson was among 11 people arrested in February suspected of involvement in the case, dubbed by local media as the ""Big Bitcoin Heist"". The computers were stolen during four raids on data centres around Iceland, a popular location for such centres because almost 100% of the power generated in Iceland comes from renewable sources and because of the cool climate. Ten days before his escape he had been transferred to Sogn open prison in rural southern Iceland, some 95km (59 miles) from Keflavik's international airport. The prison is unfenced and inmates have access to phones and the internet, local news website Visir reports (in Icelandic). Sindri Thor Stefansson was not considered a dangerous inmate. Details are still unclear but the suspect reportedly escaped early on Tuesday and guards reported him missing only after the flight had already left Keflavik for Arlanda airport north of the Swedish capital, Stockholm.

Lawyers suggest that the anonymous nature of these digital currencies could prove tempting to those involved in an acrimonious split. One solicitor said she had seen the ""first wave"" of cases where crypto-currencies were listed as assets. Courts have wide-ranging powers to investigate hidden assets. This could include a court appointing a digital forensic expert to analyse data when it is suspected someone is trying to hide money in cryptocurrency, Vandana Chitroda, a partner at law firm Royds Withy King, said it was dealing with three cases in which the husband had bought crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum. ""These are the first cases we have seen, and we expect to see many more.  There will also be those divorces where a spouse may not have disclosed such assets, leaving a traceability nightmare,"" she said. Jacqueline Fitzgerald, partner at Wilsons law firm, said: ""Proving that one spouse has a substantial holding in a cryptocurrency and adding that to the marital assets can be a big problem."" The fact that there is no centralised system or opportunity to freeze these assets could cause difficulties, she suggested. This potentially made cases trickier than those when people tried to hide art or antiques, which were more easily traced. There was also a lack of guidance from the courts as to how these issues should be dealt with, mainly owing to the relatively recent emergence of mainstream cryptocurrency investment. There is no specific guidance from the Ministry of Justice, but the Advice Now guide, drafted by the Family Justice Council, says that both parties ""need to be honest about what you own and what income you have"". Ms Chitroda said that lawyers and their advisers, like many of their clients, had little experience in recovering and valuing these cryptocurrencies.  In one of the cases her firm is dealing with, an original investment of £80,000 in November 2016 was valued at £1m in December 2017 and was now ""worth"" £600,000. She said that the divorce process took eight months on average, so numerous valuations would be needed for the court to be given accurate information.",0.1372857142857143,0.1089781746031746

The virtual currency reached the benchmark for the first time, just days after it passed $9,000. It caps a remarkable rise in value for the crypto-currency, which was trading below $1,000 at the start of the year. Some experts believe the asset still has far to soar, but others say it represents a speculative bubble with nothing tangible at its core that could burst any time. The total value of all the bitcoins in existence has now surpassed $167bn. Bitcoin first reached $1,000 in late-2013 and then dipped significantly before starting a volatile climb to its current value. It is not entirely clear what has driven the sudden rise in value, especially because the past few weeks have been marked by action by some financial regulators to limit its use. One factor that may have helped was the US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group's announcement at the start of the month that it planned to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of 2017, which bolstered confidence in its prospects. Another was a decision to drop a controversial plan known as Segwit2x.  This would have altered the way Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, worked, to help it handle more transactions.  But the move risked splitting the community. Many industry watchers believe the rapid rise in value will not be sustained and expect its value to suddenly fall sharply. Bitcoins were first produced in 2009 and took a long time to become an accepted holder of monetary value that could be swapped for real-world cash.  One early transaction involved using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. The boom has led to a general rise in many other virtual currencies. One, known as Ethereum, is now worth about $480, but at the start of 2017 each one was worth only about $10. Many others are also trying to profit from the growing interest in crypto-currencies.  Many malware writers are now seeking to install software on vulnerable websites that create or ""mine"" the coins. In addition, scammers have sent fake text messages to people's phones, claiming they own some of the digital currency, in an effort to tempt them into opening a dangerous link.",0.22570526315789471,0.1610745614035088
22,UK company linked to laundered Bitcoin billions,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43291026,2018-03-07 00:07:48+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A UK company has been linked to the laundering of 650,000 stolen bitcoins worth £4.5bn, a BBC Radio 4 investigation has found. The coins were taken by hackers from Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. It's not clear who is in control of the London-based firm Always Efficient LLP. Mt Gox operator Mark Karpeles apologised to investors and said he was co-operating with the investigation. The FBI has charged a Russian national with laundering the stolen bitcoins. Mt Gox matched up those who wanted to buy the crypto-currency with dollars, pounds and other international denominations with those wanting to sell bitcoins, and handled an estimated 70% of the world's Bitcoin trade. The exchange was originally set up to trade cards from a game set in a world of wizards, spells and monsters. When it turned its focus to crypto-currencies, it appeared to be a huge success story.  Almost half of Bitcoin trading is done in Japanese yen, and there's even a Japanese girl group, the Virtual Currency Girls, which reflects Japan's growing craze for virtual money. But a group of amateur investigators, WizSec, found that hackers had targeted Mt Gox. They had systematically pilfered users' accounts, hiding their tracks from Mt Gox operators for years. And in 2014, the site's chief executive, Mark Karpeles, made the horrifying discovery that hundreds of thousands of coins were missing. When customers found themselves unable to withdraw funds, the site collapsed.  Speaking for the first time about the collapse to BBC Radio 4's File on Four programme, Mr Karpeles said: ""It felt like… when you fall from a building and you see the ground getting closer, and you feel like you are about to die."" He said the site had rapidly grown beyond his expectations.  ""Mt Gox went from interesting project to being, I would say, a daily nightmare of dealing with banks, governments, people I never knew existed."" How the coins had gone missing was initially a mystery.  But now investigators say almost half the stolen coins from Mt Gox ended up at rival exchange BTC-e.  The FBI says BTC-e was a hub for cyber-crime and helped to launder money from hacks, including ransomware attacks of the kind that hit the NHS and other organisations last year. But trying to find out who operates BTC-e isn't easy. The exchange claimed to be operated by a British company called Always Efficient LLP. Always Efficient's registered office is in east London, but the address is shared by several other firms, some of which are thought to be involved in money laundering. Duncan Hames, of anti-corruption group Transparency International, said it's likely to be a shell company. ""People laundering money will set up a network of companies to create layers between the original crime and their attempts to then integrate the proceeds of their crime into the economy,"" he said. ""They simply enable a series of transactions to take place to create this distance and to obscure the trail of the proceeds of crime."" In an attempt to regulate these so-called shell companies, new rules introduced in June 2016 now stipulate that companies must publish a list of ""persons with significant control"" (PWSC).  Always Efficient doesn't currently have a PWSC. The person most recently listed, Alexander Buyanov, is a DJ in a Moscow nightclub.  According to Andrei Zakharov, a Russian journalist who tracked him down, Mr Buyanov claims he ""knew nothing"" of the business. Companies House told the BBC it had a dedicated team dealing with PWSCs, and took action when irregularities were identified. The FBI says the man behind BTC-e is another Russian national, Alexander Vinnik. Documents seen by the BBC detail how the stolen Mt Gox money was laundered through various accounts, usernames and email addresses allegedly controlled by Mr Vinnik. Mr Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in Greece in July 2017, and is currently being detained in Thessaloniki. The US Department of Justice now wants to extradite him to face 21 counts of money laundering and other financial crimes in the US. Mr Zakharov said: ""They were on the beach and his wife was swimming, and when she turned back she saw a lot of people with sunglasses near her husband, and that's how he was arrested."" Russia has also filed an extradition request for Mr Vinnik on lesser, unrelated charges.  The Greek government is now in the process of deciding between the two requests.  Via his lawyer, Mr Vinnick told the BBC he denies having any connection to Always Efficient.  He added: ""BTC-e is just a web platform for buying and selling Bitcoin  - not an exchange. As such it cannot be held responsible for the source of money used to buy Bitcoin, no more than a bureau du change can be held responsible for exchanging a stolen $100 note into pounds sterling."" A National Crime Agency (NCA) spokesman said it didn't ""routinely confirm or deny investigations"" but recognised ""the very real risks to the UK and the UK's financial sector from large-scale, complex money laundering."" He added: ""Tackling money laundering is a high priority for the NCA, and we have a number of national and international operations running against the criminals involved, working in close partnership with partners in law enforcement and financial regulation."" Mark Karpeles was arrested and charged with embezzlement related to payments worth £1.7m. He says these were legitimate loans signed off by an accountant.  He's also charged with manipulation of data. He denies all the charges - none of which relates to the loss of the 650,000 bitcoins. He told the BBC he was doing all he could to return funds to customers and added: ""I am very sorry that when I was in charge things happened the way they did."" Mt Gox is not the only Bitcoin currency exchange to be hacked. Even the Virtual Currency Girls have lost money following another recent Bitcoin exchange theft. Under Japanese bankruptcy law, the remaining 200,000 Mt Gox bitcoins are valued at £300 each, the price they held when the exchange collapsed in 2014. Since then, the value has increased to around £7,000 each. Many investors are now pushing to see their Mt Gox bitcoins refunded at the current price, and a decision is expected within the next few months. So regardless of the outcome in Mr Vinnik's case, Mt Gox creditors who lost out might still turn a profit, thanks to Bitcoin's unprecedented rise.

Two of the suspects are in custody, and nine have been released on bail. The stolen servers have not been recovered. The AP newswire said police were now contacting internet service provider (ISPs), electricians and storage units, asking them to report sudden spikes in power usage or other signs the stolen servers had been reconnected. The value of the stolen computers has been put at $2m (£1.45m). In February, Iceland's HS Orka power generation company said it was seeing an ""exponential"" rise in the amount of energy being used in these data centres to mine and verify crypto-currency transactions.

It said Bitcoin users now saw the virtual currency largely as an ""asset"" to be traded, rather than something to make payments with. Fewer online merchants wanted to accept the cryptocurrency, it added.  Rising fees and longer transaction times as a result of price fluctuations also lessened its appeal, Stripe said. Customers of the US-based payments firm pay a fee to Stripe each time it processes a payment. Clients include Lyft, Deliveroo, Grab and Target. In 2014, it became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments. At the time Stripe said it hoped Bitcoin would become a way for people in places with low credit card penetration or prohibitively high credit card fees to do transactions online. But the virtual currency was now ""better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,"" it said.  There has been a huge surge of interest in the digital currency over the past year or so, driven largely by its rapid increase in price. But that demand has also led to huge swings in price, with Stripe saying the volatility meant the time needed to complete a sale had risen. ""By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,"" Stripe's product manager Tom Karlo said in his blog. Bitcoin transaction fees had also risen ""a great deal"" resulting in a decrease in demand from Stripe's customers to accept Bitcoin payments, he said. ""For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of US dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires,"" Mr Karlo wrote.  ""Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we've seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially."" Stripe said it would start winding down its support for Bitcoin immediately and would stop all transactions by 23 April. But it said its decision to end support for Bitcoin payments did not mean it was giving up on cryptocurrencies all together.  ""We're interested in what's happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments,"" Mr Karlo said. ""OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects.""",0.36647368421052634,0.07612990810359231

Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said virtual currencies were ""great concerns"" and that the ministry was preparing a bill to ban trading.  However, South Korea's presidential office said later that a ban had not yet been finalised and was one measure being considered. The local Bitcoin price fell by a fifth after the justice minister's comments. In South Korea it trades at about a 30% premium compared with other countries. There is no one fixed price for Bitcoin as it is not regulated and is traded on dozens of exchanges worldwide. According to Coindesk.com, the price of Bitcoin was about 8% lower at just under $13,800 on Thursday afternoon.  South Korea has become a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for about 20% of global Bitcoin transactions.  It has more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the Korea Blockchain Industry Association. Several were raided this week in a probe into alleged tax evasion, including the country's second-largest virtual currency operator, Bithumb. The government had already said in December that it would apply more scrutiny to the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading. Given the low levels of trading and relatively small number of people holding virtual currencies, wild price swings have become the norm, leading to an argument that paying too much attention to price rises and falls is futile.

But even in the turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is seen as a pretty wild creature. It was launched in 2013, inspired by a short-lived online craze for pictures of a particular Japanese dog breed. Last weekend, however, it nearly doubled in value and is now worth more than $2bn (£1.5bn). Dogecoin had been gaining steadily all through December, but the latest spike has prompted howls of ""crypto-hype"" from sceptics. Granted, it's still well behind the biggest beast in the digital currency pack, Bitcoin, which has a total value of more than $270bn. But given that Dogecoin was initially intended as a parody of the Bitcoin boom, its founder, Jackson Palmer, is none too happy now that it has slipped its leash. ""The fact that most conversations happening in the media and between peers focus on the investment potential is worrying,"" he said earlier this month. Until its recent rise in value, Dogecoin was little known beyond a small coterie of geeks. But in sporting circles, the cryptocurrency's backers have gained a reputation for some unorthodox sponsorship choices. In 2014, US stock car racing became a surprise beneficiary, when members of the Dogecoin community decided to give a helping hand to Nascar driver Josh Wise, donating $55,000 worth of the digital currency. That same year, Dogecoin backers raised $25,000 to send the Jamaican bobsleigh team to the winter Olympics. Sporting underdogs have clearly done well out of Dogecoin, but what about investors? Will they be barking up the wrong tree if they buy into the currency? Well, one thing to bear in mind is that dogecoins are far more numerous than bitcoins. The rules underpinning Bitcoin say that only 21 million bitcoins can be created - and that figure is getting ever nearer. It is unclear what will happen to the value of bitcoins when that limit is reached. Dogecoins are ""mined"" in the same way as bitcoins - that is, they are created using computer processing power. However, unlike Bitcoin, there is no upper limit on the number of dogecoins that can be produced, with a staggering 100 billion already in existence. That helps to explain why each dogecoin is currently worth less than two US cents, while Bitcoin's peak value to date was nearly $20,000. Common sense tells us that scarce commodities are more likely to hold their value than plentiful ones. But in the world of cryptocurrencies, common sense is perhaps a poor guide to future behaviour. And in the world of economic experts, there is still widespread scepticism about any and every form of cryptocurrency. Prof Ethan Ilzetzki at the London School of Economics told the BBC: ""A digital unit of currency has no intrinsic value unless it can be used in transactions, and I cannot name a single cryptocurrency that is more useful in transactions than a credit card that's denominated in dollars or pounds or yen. ""There's nothing inherently wrong with privately provided digital currencies, but they need to be well designed and well thought out. ""They're worth a lot because people say they're worth a lot. I have very little confidence that they have any long-term value.""",0.252596,0.07941349206349207

The Metropolitan Police says criminals are using crypto-currency cash machines to launder money in London. The government's aim is part of a broader update to the EU rules which are under negotiation.  The update, revealed in Parliament last month, would mean that traders would no longer be able to operate anonymously. Bitcoin expert Dr Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said that in jurisdictions such as New York, crypto-currency is already subject to tighter regulation. ""I think these announcements have a powerful signalling effect and put the industry on notice that the 'cop on the beat' is concerned and watching crypto-currencies more closely now,"" he said of the Treasury news. ""This in turn will motivate companies to more effectively self-police bad actors."" At a press briefing, Scotland Yard warned about the currencies' popularity among criminals.  ""Organised criminal groups have been early adopters of crypto-currencies to evade traditional money laundering checks and statutory regulations,"" said Det Supt Nick Stevens, from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Criminals have also used crypto-currencies to purchase illegal commodities on dark market sites with anonymity."" A Treasury spokesman said that there were already ""clear tax rules"" for legitimate crypto-currency users. ""We also intend to update regulation to bring virtual currency exchange platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation,"" he added. The value of Bitcoin has continued to climb after reaching a landmark value of $10,000 (£7,400) and at the time of writing was trading at more than $11,200.

Sindri Thor Stefansson is suspected of masterminding the theft of 600 computers to mine virtual currencies. In a letter, he said he was not guilty, he had been held in Iceland without trial and would take his case to the European Court of Human Rights. Talks were under way with Iceland's police to allow him to return, he said. Mr Stefansson escaped Sogn open prison in rural southern Iceland early on Tuesday and managed to reach Keflavik international airport. He then took a flight to Sweden with a ticket which had another man's name. An international warrant has been issued for his arrest. Mr Stefansson said he was not serving a sentence in Iceland and that his period of custody had run out. He said he was told on Monday that he was actually free to go, but that the police would arrest him if he left the prison without an explanation. ""I simply refuse to be in prison of my own free will, especially when the police threaten to arrest me without explanation,"" he said in a letter to Iceland's Frettabladid newspaper, claiming that he was forced to sign a statement agreeing to remain in custody. ""I'm not trying to say that it was the right decision to leave, I really regret it... I didn't expect an international arrest warrant to be issued against me, as I was legally free to leave, and believed it was out of the question that I would be labelled a fugitive. ""I would never have done this if I didn't believe I was a free man."" There was no evidence that he was involved in the computer heist, he said, ""only suspicion"". Without revealing his current location, he said he was given ""a roof over my head, a car, false papers if I want them and money"" and that he could be on the run ""as long as I like"". ""It would be no problem if that's what I wanted, but I would rather face this in Iceland, so I'll be back soon."" Icelandic officials have not yet commented on the letter. Sindri Thor Stefansson was among 11 people arrested in February in connection with the case. He was not considered a dangerous inmate and, 10 days before his escape, he had been transferred to Sogn prison, an unfenced facility where inmates reportedly have access to phones and the internet. Local media reports say he booked his ticket an hour before the flight's departure. Despite using a different name, he paid using his own credit or debit card. He reportedly escaped the low-security prison through a window and arrived at the airport - some 95km (59 miles) away - by taxi. Police were still trying to locate the driver. Security cameras showed him carrying hand luggage and a laptop. He was wearing a black cap, blue jeans and white running shoes.

The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow the futures to be traded was seen as a watershed moment for the currency. It means that investors will be able to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in Bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price. CME Group said trading would be available on its CME Globex electronic trading platform from 18 December. To guard against volatility, CME and CBOE will put in place stricter than usual risk-management safeguards.  CME and CBOE have also agreed to enter into data-sharing agreements, particularly on the settlement process, so the CFTC can conduct its own surveillance on the new financial contracts. Bitcoin's rapid rise from less than $800 in December last year to more than $11,000 this week on Coindesk has stoked fears that it is a pricing bubble that could leave recent investors worse-off. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" at a conference in early September, while Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has questioned whether the crypto-currency is a currency at all, given its volatile pricing. It ""doesn't feel like a store of value,"" he has said.",0.06684166666666665,0.04976551226551226
33,Bitcoin slides amid rollercoaster ride,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42178705,2017-11-30 18:18:06+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The price of digital currency Bitcoin has fallen sharply in a period of wild trading since it passed the $11,000 mark a day ago.  Bitcoin is now around $9,600, down about 16% from the record $11,434 (£8,500) it hit on Wednesday. The digital currency is used by some people to pay for things online, but most users see it as an investment. On Wednesday, a Bank of England deputy governor warned ""investors should do their homework"" on Bitcoin. There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  At its peak, Bitcoin had increased by 1,000% from the $1,000 value at which it started the year. Bitcoin is ""prone to wild swings"", partly because it is not well regulated and because there are fewer traders, said Dr Garrick Hileman of the Judge Business School at University of Cambridge. The trading over the past day ""was a rollercoaster like nothing I've ever seen,"" said Neil Wilson, a financial analyst at ETX capital in London. He said part of the volatility was due to small investors ""with no market experience"" buying and selling the coin. ""There is no way to discern what fair value is - it's so incredibly speculative and it is so new and not properly understood."" Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. On Thursday, Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, warned that digital currencies like Bitcoin could pose ""more serious financial stability issues"" if adopted widely. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, said Bitcoin was ""not of a size that would be a threat to financial stability"" or a risk to the UK economy. But he also told the BBC on Wednesday: ""People need to be clear this is not an official currency. No central bank stands behind it, no government stands behind it.""  Bitcoin is ""closer to a commodity"" than a currency, with people choosing to invest and trade in it, Sir Jon said. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are coming under closer scrutiny due to the rapid price rise. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".

On Friday the price fell below $7,910 on the Bitstamp exchange, a 12% fall on the day before, but recovered slightly.  But although it is far short of the $19,000 it reached in November 2017, it is still way above the $1,000 level at which it started trading last year.  The fall comes amid a number of recent incidents that appear to have shaken faith in cryptocurrencies. On Friday, Japan's financial regulator carried out a surprise check on major Japanese exchange, Coincheck, which last week was subject to a security hack. The regulator said it had asked the exchange to fix flaws in its computer networks well before last week's theft by hackers of $530m of digital money. Also this week, Facebook said it would ban adverts for digital currencies. Other countries have already expressed concerns about such entities. China and South Korea have banned any new virtual currency launches and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".  Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for. Last year, two of the world's largest commodity exchanges, the CBOE futures exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, both allowed trading in Bitcoin futures.  Bitcoin is the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but there are scores of others, the majority of which also fell on Friday, according to the Coinmarketcap.com price tracker.

He made his fortune by investing in Bitcoin and using it to develop his businesses. Newsbeat first spoke to the teenager in 2014 when he'd just turned $1,000 (£700) into $100,000. He told us how, after struggling in school, he started a company that paired students looking for work experience with intern positions. ""I made a bet with my parents that if I made a million dollars by the age of 18 I wouldn't have to go to college,"" he said.  End of Instagram post  by erikfinman And by the time he was 18, Erik claims he had made even more than that.  The teenager, from Idaho, features in Radio 1's latest WTF (What's the Fuss?) programme about Bitcoin.  In it, Newsbeat investigates the hype around the volatile cryptocurrency and where it all began.  ""Right now one Bitcoin is worth around $10,000 (£7,000) and I have about 401 Bitcoin so that's just over about four million dollars, currently,"" Erik tells us. He says ""currently"" because the price of Bitcoin plummets and rises so often you can never be too sure exactly how much money's in your digital wallet. But with Silicon Valley buffs, celebrities and now even amateur Bitcoin enthusiasts getting involved using Bitcoin exchange apps, cryptocurrency is more accessible than ever.  End of Instagram post 2 by erikfinman ""Now anyone can work from wherever they want with just an internet connection and a laptop,"" he says.  ""You could be a young developer that created a product with a coin involved but be terrible at marketing.

""People will be co-founders without ever talking to each other even once,"" he says. Erik sold his first company for more Bitcoin and is currently travelling the world looking for a team to help him develop a cryptocurrency of his own.  As well as investing in business, he's also built up quite the reputation for enjoying the finer things in life.  ""I like the fast cars, I like driving an Audi R8.

Cryptocurrency is absolutely here to stay. Its success is absolutely inevitable. ""Is Bitcoin MySpace or is it Facebook, Google and Amazon?"" he adds.  ""Is it one of those early technologies that will survive this moment?  ""I don't know, but I'm diversified.

36,Is Asia driving the Bitcoin craze?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42409685,2017-12-20 02:05:28+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Tucked away in a quiet corner of Singapore, the industrial complex looks like an underground ghetto.  But this, says Dexter Ng, is the workshop of the future. A self-professed cryptocurrency entrepreneur, he's the chief technology officer of SG Mining - a business making and selling rigs.  These are the powerful computers that solve complex mathematical problems in a process that earns their owners digital currencies such as Bitcoin. ""Previously we could only sell two or three of these rigs a week,"" he tells me as we walk around the cemented warehouse. ""Now we can sell hundreds.""   Some of these machines go abroad, including Japan. Getting hard data on just how many Japanese investors have bought into the digital currency is difficult, because there's no central body that oversees it. But Japan was the first Asian country to recognise Bitcoin and has built trust by fully legalising cryptocurrencies. Recently a Japanese firm announced that it would start paying a portion of its employees salaries in Bitcoin.  Australia is another country in the region that has embraced the cryptocurrency, but now is moving to regulate it because of the way amateur investors are piling into the market.  So is it fair to say Asia is driving the Bitcoin craze? At one point Chinese investors reportedly made up at least 80% of Bitcoin ownership, but Beijing is now being cautious. Worried about the outflow of funds into the market, China effectively banned cryptocurrencies by outlawing initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which are basically public share offerings that are invested in via the use of digital currencies.  And it's not alone.  Vietnam banned Bitcoin and other digital currencies. India and Indonesia are considering regulation.  And just this week, Singapore has changed it's previously moderate tone on cryptocurrencies to one of extreme caution - warning its citizens about the ""significant"" risks they take on if they choose to invest in them.  But that hasn't stopped investors here from trying their luck. At a Bitcoin exchange in Singapore, I meet a group of enthusiasts who each put in about $100 (£75) a week to buy the digital currency.  ""It is the currency of the future,"" one man tells me, refusing to divulge his name because he didn't want his employer to know he was buying Bitcoin.  ""If you say this is a scam, then didn't the financial crisis teach us that all financial institutions are scams anyway?"" Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It's often seen as the currency of choice for institution-weary millennials, but has also been used by money launderers, criminals, and drug buyers and dealers.  Increasingly though, more Asians are starting to see it as a way to make some quick cash, but also as a way to safeguard their savings against political crises and low interest rates.  ""Many of our customers see it as a form of digital gold,"" Zann Kwan, founder of the Bitcoin Exchange tells me.  ""It sort of dovetails into the saving mode or the saving mindset of Asians.""  Analysts also point to the low or zero interest rate environment in Japan, the strict regulations on getting money out of China, and concerns about the North Korean crisis impacting the economy in South Korea as reasons why so many in Asia are trying to cash in on the Bitcoin craze. But they may already be too late.  ""The quick money has clearly been made,"" says Dheeraj Bharwani, an independent wealth strategist who has recently started advising his clients on acquiring cryptocurrencies.  ""I tell my clients, be prepared for a 50% to 60% downside. You have to have a time horizon of years, not months."" But that hasn't stopped some businesses from cashing in on the crypto craze in Asia.  On the top of the Singapore Landmark Tower is the Skyline Crypto Club. Customers can pay for their drinks using Ethereum, another popular and increasingly valuable digital currency. For now, it makes up only a small percentage of transactions, but club owners expect that to grow.  ""We are even offering a New Year's Eve Bitcoin package, where you pay for your night using a Bitcoin,"" the club's manager Subhaish Rajamanickam tells me.  At today's price, that's around $17,000 (£12,700) worth of alcohol.  But Bitcoin is so volatile, there's no telling whether it will be enough to get you a cocktail or two in the future.

37,Russian nuclear scientists arrested for 'Bitcoin mining plot',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43003740,2018-02-09 12:07:24+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Russian security officers have arrested several scientists working at a top-secret Russian nuclear warhead facility for allegedly mining crypto-currencies. The suspects had tried to use one of Russia's most powerful supercomputers to mine Bitcoins, media reports say.  The Federal Nuclear Centre in Sarov, western Russia, is a restricted area. The centre's press service said: ""There has been an unsanctioned attempt to use computer facilities for private purposes including so-called mining.""  The supercomputer was not supposed to be connected to the internet - to prevent intrusion - and once the scientists attempted to do so, the nuclear centre's security department was alerted. They were handed over to the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian news service Mash says. ""As far as we are aware, a criminal case has been launched against them,"" the press service told Interfax news agency. Crypto-currencies like Bitcoin do not rely on centralised computer servers. People who provide computer processing power to the crypto-currency system, to enable transactions to take place, can get rewards in Bitcoins. In the Cold War the USSR's first nuclear bomb was produced at Sarov, during Joseph Stalin's rule.  The top-secret town was not even marked on Soviet maps and special permits are still required for Russians to visit it. What is Bitcoin? Putin, power and poison: Russia’s elite FSB spy club Sarov is surrounded by a tightly guarded no-man's-land, with barbed wire fences to keep the curious away. There are suspicions that the radioactive polonium-210 used to kill ex-FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 came from Sarov. The Federal Nuclear Centre reportedly employs up to 20,000 people and its supercomputer boasts a capacity of 1 petaflop, the equivalent of 1,000 trillion calculations per second. Mining crypto-currencies requires great computational power and huge amounts of energy.  There have been reports of some other industrial facilities in Russia being used for crypto-mining, and one businessman reportedly bought two power stations for the activity. (link in Russian).

The digital currency slid as low as $13,963, according to Coindesk.com, before rallying again to trade at about $15,600 on Friday afternoon.  Bitcoin has soared about 70% this week, with its dramatic rise being likened to a ""charging train with no brakes"". As concerns mount, an industry group has warned plans to start Bitcoin futures trading have been ""rushed"". Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, but others argue it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. ""Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes,"" said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers.  Nigel Green, of financial consultancy deVere Group, said he expected Bitcoin to see-saw in coming weeks. ""Today's digital world needs crypto-currencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's Bitcoin or not remains to be seen,"" he added. The surging price of Bitcoin has been helped by the start of trading on the Chicago-based Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, will begin its Bitcoin offering a week later. Trading on futures exchanges allows investors to buy and sell contracts for the crypto-currency at a certain point in the future at an agreed price. Tim McCourt, CME's global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said customers are excited but he is not certain how much interest the futures will attract in the first days of trading. He said he will consider the launch successful if there is a balance of buyers and sellers, and market movements correspond to the underlying Bitcoin price. ""That's the larger measure of success,"" he said. ""What does the market look like - not necessarily how much does it trade."" 'Weighing the risks'? The Futures Industry Association, which includes Wall Street's largest banks, brokers and traders, has written to the US regulator over concerns that the contracts were approved ""without properly weighing the risks"". ""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearing houses,"" the association said. Edward Tilly, chief executive of Cboe, said he thinks the criticism is unfair. He said his firm worked extensively with regulators to figure out how this would work. For example, the firm set up rules in the contracts to address concerns that Bitcoin's value has sometimes varied widely, depending on the exchange. ""This is a walk-before-you-run launch,"" he said. ""It is mindful that this is new to the marketplace."" While Goldman Sachs is a member of the futures industry association, it is also one of the banks that will work as an intermediary to help clear Bitcoin futures contracts for some clients. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said it was evaluating the risks as part of its due diligence process. Many big investors have been reluctant to pile into the crypto-currency market unless it is regulated.  However, the prospect of a Bitcoin futures market has raised hopes that it will be regarded as sufficiently ""regulated"".  While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop. Mr Green added: ""Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters... an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors."" Even a crash or a major correction is unlikely to pose risks to the global economy, some analysts say. While billions of dollars have been invested in Bitcoin, its $268bn total market value is still small compared to other asset classes. ",0.09209032258064517,0.020133623097332774

The value of Bitcoin is currently extremely volatile, but at the time of writing, the amount stolen was worth approximately $80m. The hacked service was NiceHash, a Slovenia-based mining exchange. It said it was working hard to recover the Bitcoin for its users, adding: ""Someone really wanted to bring us down."" The attack happened early on Wednesday, said NiceHash's chief executive Marko Kobal. Attackers accessed the company's systems at 01:18 CET (00:18 GMT). By 03:37 the hackers, whom the company believes were based outside the European Union, had begun stealing Bitcoin. The theft comes as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge, dumbfounding experts and stoking concerns of a bubble. High-stakes attacks like this are not uncommon, with several large breaches and thefts hitting Bitcoin and other related services over the past year. NiceHash is a mining service, a company that pairs up people with spare computing power with those willing to pay to use it to mine for new Bitcoin. Mr Kobal appeared on Facebook Live to address concerns about the hack. ""We have not abandoned you guys,"" he said. He explained that an employee's computer was compromised in the attack. He added that ""forensic analysis"" involving local and international authorities was taking place, but did not expand on which specific agencies were involved when asked by the BBC. The company was heavily criticised by its users who commented in droves on Facebook. Communications were complicated further when a spoof Facebook page for the company was set up and spreading disinformation about the breach.

While it is a historic moment of sorts, Bitcoin is usually compared to the dollar. The virtual currency peaked at $6,649.33 (£5,015) at about 16:34 GMT on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. The total value of Bitcoin in circulation is currently $110bn (£83bn) and the cryptocurrency has risen more than seven-fold against the dollar over the past year. The reason for the latest jump in value was in part driven by an announcement by US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group about a plan to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of the year. Bitcoin was launched in January 2009. Its value was lower than $100 in June 2013, and below $1,000 as recently as January. But in August, the virtual currency soared to $3,451 after a spin-off - Bitcoin Cash - failed to prove as disruptive as had been feared. And in September, Bitcoin crossed the $5,000 threshold for the first time. ""It's been a very innovative year - there have been a lot of new technology platforms for cryptocurrencies, which have lifted Bitcoin,"" Garrick Hileman a research fellow at University of Cambridge told the BBC. ""It wouldn't surprise me if the price were to go even higher."" Coinbase - a business that lets the public trade and store digital currencies - reports that it is now signing up between 35,000 to 50,000 new users per day. Mr Hileman said that many people had recently been attracted to invest in Bitcoin because when a ""fork"" happened in August, investors received an equivalent amount of new Bitcoin Cash coins for free. Another ""fork"", SegWit2x, is due to happen on 18 November. ""Rising geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula are also driving interest in Bitcoin in the surrounding countries, because people are wary of investing in the yen or the dollar,"" Mr Hileman added.

Canadian crypto-currency exchange firm Arbitrade bought four casts from South African businessman Malcolm Duncan.  The firm said it planned to launch a global ""Golden Hands of Nelson Mandela"" tour to educate young people about the anti-apartheid icon's life.  This is the first time artefacts of Mr Mandela have been sold in bitcoin.  Mr Mandela was jailed for 27 years for fighting white minority rule in South Africa.  He was released in 1990, and served as president from 1994 to 1999.  Mr Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He had turned into a global brand, with businessmen and artists cashing in on his name.  Mr Duncan, who now lives in Canada, bought the casts from mining group Harmony Gold in 2002 for about $31,000.  Half of the money paid to Harmony Gold was meant to go to charity, but it remains unclear as to whether that happened, Bloomberg news agency reports.  Harmony said it had ""supplied Mr Duncan with the necessary paperwork verifying the provenance as requested by his attorneys,"" but declined to comment on what happened to the donation, Bloomberg reports. The casts, which weigh around 20lb (9kg), include Mr Mandela's hand, palm and fist. They are part of a collection meant to mark the years the former president spent in prison on Robben Island.  The artefacts are believed to be the only ones left in the world.  The other sets of the collection were ordered to be destroyed by Mr Mandela, Mr Duncan told Bloomberg.  It was part of the former president's attempt to control his copyright after a number of scandals, including forgery allegations, arose around the sale of art bearing his image and name.  Arbitrade has paid Mr Duncan a bitcoin deposit that has been converted to $50,000, and the rest is expected to be paid in quarterly instalments of at least $2m, Bloomberg reports. ""They take possession when I have the dollar amount in the bank, At two-and-a-quarter million at a time, they take one hand at a time,"" Mr Duncan was quoted as saying. Arbitrade is due to launch an initial coin offering and plans to mine its own crypto-currencies and trade others, Bloomberg reports.

It comes as the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell after a year when prices rose significantly.  Welsh lawyer and technology expert Dr Cerian Jones said potential investors should research and understand what they are getting into.   But she thinks these currencies are ""here to stay"" despite concerns.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes referred to as digital or virtual currencies. You can use them to buy products and services - for instance you can buy a holiday online using Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies include Ethereum and Litecoin.  Digital currencies are used day to day in some European countries, but at present not many shops in the UK accept them.  The value of Bitcoin has fallen sharply in recent weeks, but is worth five times more than it was a year ago. Dr Jones, who is a partner and patent attorney specialising in the technology sector at UDL Intellectual property in Cardiff, said while she expects some of these virtual currencies to fail, and there is ""a huge amount of froth out there"", cryptocurrencies will continue in some form, due to their international popularity.  ""In the UK we're not as far advanced as other countries. If you go abroad you will see there is much wider adoption of some of the currencies. For example Japan last year legalised [Bitcoin] as legal tender,"" she said. However international opinion is divided, and the UK government is considering regulation of digital currencies  because of fears they can be used for money laundering.    Welsh multimillionaire Kevin Green is sceptical and prefers well-established assets like property and gold and silver bullion.   ""I feel a lot safer in the steady growth of that over the years rather than the boom and bust type of scenario that's happening with cryptocurrency. ""If the price drops, at least with property you've got something you can sell and recover. With cryptocurrency we don't know whether it's going to drop right back to nothing, disappear, that's the problem."" Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", using computer software to solve mathematical problems in exchange for the ""coins"".  Rural Monmouthshire may seem an unlikely location for such a mine, but Adrian Cole was one of Wales' first producers when he kitted out a barn in 2013. The specialist computer equipment burned through so much electricity the barn stayed constantly at 25-30 degrees Celsius and the authorities asked them what they were doing.  Technology enthusiast Mr Cole initially thought the currency was a ""bit of a joke"" when he learned about it in 2012 but changed his mind. ""When you start to study Bitcoin, it really makes you ask questions about economics and how money's created...When you start to really understand the technology and some of the thinking behind it, it's quite revolutionary.""  Mr Cole dismantled his mine in 2014 because it was no longer cost-effective, and he now works as a cryptocurrency consultant. He said investors should be cautious as virtual currencies are not regulated. ""I would never recommend that anybody puts a large amount of their personal wealth into Bitcoin, you should treat it as an experiment and learn about it and educate yourself.""",0.11995416666666665,0.03115575396825397

According to Coindesk.com, Bitcoin reached $16,663.18 (£12, 358.35), having soared over 50% in a week.   The new high comes days before the launch of Bitcoin futures on two exchanges, including the world's largest futures exchange, CME. Spread betting firm CMC Markets said the rise had all the symptoms of a bubble market, warning ""there is no way to know when the bubble will burst"". What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? US regulator approves Bitcoin trading Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  The digital currency's rapid ascent from around $1,000 at the start of the year has put it in the spotlight. Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".  But last week a US regulator agreed to let two traditional exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts. The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow investors  to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price - was seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin. Cambridge Global Payments director of global product and market strategy Karl Schamotta said that move was behind the latest rally: ""The perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to Bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here."" But Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said the rise in Bitcoin's value was ""mostly motivated by fear of missing out and greed"". Bitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million.",0.0866,-0.04143198906356802

45,"Markets, Brexit and Bitcoin: 2018's themes",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42581934,2018-01-05 21:50:16+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"As the new year gets underway, expert commentators give their view on what 2018 holds in store. Here are three big themes to watch out for over the next 12 months. The new year has begun with stock markets in the UK and US hitting new record highs.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 25,000 points for the first time this week, while the broader S&P 500 is also at historic highs. In London the FTSE 100 closed on Friday at a new record high of 7,724 points. But could stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic change tack and come crashing back to earth this year?  Sonja Laud, head of equities at Fidelity International, thinks that is a possibility. While market fundamentals remain pretty strong, there are ""very stretched valuations across most asset classes"", she says.  After keeping the cash taps turned on for the past decade in the wake of the financial crash, the US Federal Reserve will start to cut back on the stimulus, known as quantitative easing, in 2018. Richard Dunbar, investment director at Aberdeen Standard, says that flow of easy borrowing cash from central banks has driven markets in recent years. Investors should now be prepared for ""more modest returns"" in all asset classes, he says.  Mr Dunbar also expects inflation to start to rise in the US in 2018 given that unemployment is at a 17-year low and wage growth is picking up.  Despite being at record highs, the UK's stock market rally lags behind that seen on Wall Street and major European markets. During 2017, the FTSE 100 rose in value by 7%, compared with 12% for the US's Dow Jones index and 15% for Germany's Dax. Another topic that will loom over the UK markets and economy is Brexit, as trade talks with Brussels get underway. Companies and business lobby groups have called on the government to retain easy access to EU markets and labour without additional costs or red tape, but the final shape of a trade deal remains unclear. Ms Laud of Fidelity says the spectre of Brexit still hangs over the UK. ""That could create a lot of volatility this year,"" she warns.  Vicky Pryce, chief economic advisor at CEBR and a Remain supporter, says the uncertainty about the shape of Britain's departure from the European Union has meant many companies - both domestic and foreign - have been unwilling to make long-term commitments. Ideally they want as little change as possible from the status quo, she adds, and believes that the government is ""slowly moving in that direction"".  For Roger Bootle, chairman of Capital Economics and a high-profile Brexit supporter, he hopes the UK is able to strike a ""deep and special"" trade relationship with the EU.  But he is not too worried if that is not the outcome: ""I think it's perfectly possible for Brexit to deliver some very good results for the UK even if we don't get that deal."" The surprise at the tail end of 2017 was the sudden surge in the value of Bitcoin to almost $20,000 at one point from about $1,000 at the start of the year. Although it is not the only digital currency, Bitcoin is the one with the highest public profile and is attracting the most interest worldwide. While some have been alarmed at the stratospheric rise in the cryptocurrency's value, others are convinced that it is now a new asset class that is set to continue gaining in value. Catherine Mulligan, co-director of the Imperial College Centre for Cryptocurrency Research, says new ways of trading Bitcoin are allowing small investors to get in on the act. However, 2018 is also likely to bring increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies in a bid to protect consumers, she adds. Unlike traditional currencies, they are not overseen by central banks and the possibility remains that some speculators could get burnt badly if the value of Bitcoin, for example, plunges.",0.19343846153846153,0.0958882437007437

Sheikh Shawki Allam, the Grand Mutfi, said the digital crypto-currency carried risks of ""fraudulence, lack of knowledge, and cheating"". Bitcoin began last year below $1,000 (£737) but reached nearly $20,000 before the end of the year. Then it lost more than 25% of its value inside a week, sparking warnings of a dangerous bubble. The Grand Mufti said risks could arise because the virtual currency was not subject to surveillance by any centralised authority. ""Bitcoin is forbidden in Sharia as it causes harm to individuals, groups and institutions,"" the fatwa said, as reported by Egyptian daily Ahram In August 2017, Egypt's first bitcoin exchange was opened. The crypto-currency was declared illegitimate by the authorities last month. An adviser to the Grand Mufti, Magdy Ashour, told Egypt Today that Bitcoin was ""used directly to fund terrorists"". Last month, a New York-based woman was charged with laundering Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies and wiring the money to help so-called Islamic State.

The move takes it to 20% above the level it stood at on Friday, according to the Luxembourg-based Bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp. It started the year at around $1,000. Virtual currencies are largely unregulated and bypass traditional banking systems. Their growth is of increasing concern to international regulators.  China and South Korea have banned any new virtual currency launches and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded.  JP Morgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described Bitcoin at a recent conference as ""a fraud"". ""It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,"" he said. Currencies such as Bitcoin use blockchain, which is an online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of anonymous computers on the internet. They are not backed by any government, nor central bank and therefore there is no-one responsible for backing their value. European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters news agency that Bitcoin ""could easily blow up, and central banks could then be accused of not doing anything. ""So we're trying to understand whether bank activity in relation to crypto-currency trading needs to be better regulated."" This has felt like the latest, maddest speculative bubble, a tulip fever for the hi-tech era.   On its helter skelter ride towards $10,000, there have been plenty of occasions where Bitcoin has seemed in trouble - splits in the community over how it should be governed,  robberies at exchanges, warnings from regulators. But every time that pundits have warned the bubble is about to burst, the currency has stuttered for a few days and then gone charging higher. Read more from Rory, here: Some banks are looking at whether the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies could be of use to them as the world moves further away from cash transactions. The world's leading derivatives exchange, the CME, said recently it planned to offer trading in Bitcoin futures in the near future, although it has not yet set a date. The potential involvement of CME has spurred the price of Bitcoin higher. Jameel Ahmad, from Cyprus-based online foreign exchange broker, FXTM, said: ""This rise appears to have been triggered by hopes the CME move will bring in investment from hedge funds and other major investors and move Bitcoin into the mainstream."" Bitcoin is particularly susceptible to rumour. Mr Ahmad said there is also talk that Amazon is considering accepting Bitcoin as payment. There is also concern that Bitcoin could be vulnerable to hackers. Mr Ahmad said that recently it lost almost 20% in value on fears it was being hacked.",-0.026204761904761904,0.026857391946677658

Back in April 2016, while working on a story about the cryptocurrency, I bought  0.17 Bitcoin for $87, which was then equivalent to about £60.  Over the 18 months since, I confess I have opened my Bitcoin wallet on my smartphone with increasing frequency, staring with mounting disbelief at my balance which stands today at $1,713 - getting on for £1,300. All along, this has felt like the latest, maddest speculative bubble, a tulip fever for the hi-tech era.   On its helter skelter ride towards $10,000, there have been plenty of occasions where Bitcoin has seemed in trouble - splits in the community over how it should be governed,  robberies at exchanges, warnings from regulators. But every time that pundits have warned the bubble is about to burst, the currency has stuttered for a few days and then gone charging higher. Along the way, it has lost one of the core features of a currency in that it is no longer much used as a means of exchange.  A couple of years ago, there were all kinds of stories about ways you could spend Bitcoin - a pub in Shoreditch accepted it,  a newsagent in Swanage boasted that a customer had bought a Kitcat with it, I even ordered a pizza paid for with the currency. Now, nobody who owns Bitcoin wants to spend it - why would you when it will be worth more tomorrow? Neither is it quite as easy and cheap a way of moving money around the world as its backers once claimed, with fees for exchanging it into fiat currencies rising and law enforcement agencies on the lookout for evidence of money laundering. But the biggest shadow over Bitcoin's future is the growing evidence that it is hugely wasteful in terms of energy use. By one estimate, the process of mining new coins and recording new Bitcoin transactions now consumes more electricity each year than is used by Ireland. The continued rise in the value of Bitcoin looks unsustainable in both economic and environmental terms.  But there's an old saying that, when the last naysayer changes their mind and gives in to an investment craze, that's when a bubble bursts. So look out for JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon, who in October described investors in Bitcoin as ""stupid"".  When he starts saying cryptocurrencies are the future, it may be time to sell.",0.03477999999999999,0.07328282828282831

51,Is bitcoin finally going mainstream in the Midlands?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-42838922,2018-01-26 17:53:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Hanging around with bitcoin enthusiasts is intoxicating.  It's a seductive idea, free magic money from the internet.  And while purchasing, trading and selling bitcoin once was a complex and technical process it's all about to become a lot simpler. But first if you want to understand more about bitcoin and other coins built on the same technology there's a BBC explainer here. In Coventry you can now buy and sell and even spend bitcoins. All thanks to a nightclub and one of the country's first bitcoin ATM machines newly installed in a shop in the city.  Nestled next to the newspapers, the machine has a large touch screen and makes the process of buying and selling bitcoins pretty painless.  You need a wallet app on your smartphone to download and store the bitcoins once you've bought them and there's a £10 fee for each transaction, but otherwise it's pretty simple. Round the corner the S7EVEN nightclub is tweaking its tills so they can accept bitcoin.  As the owner Kevin McCloskey (who also invests in the currency) explained to me, it's likely they'll start by accepting bitcoin for larger items first; so a booth booking with plenty of booze rather than a single pint of lager. But eventually staff with have T-shirts with scan-able codes so customers can tip in bitcoins directly. But all this does illustrate one of the problems of bitcoin in the real world.  First of all, why spend it at all?  The price may have plunged from the pre-Christmas highs but plenty of people believe it will climb again and so would rather hold on to it than spend it. There's also a technical limitation which isn't often discussed in the media.  The Visa company behind your credit or bank card can process thousands of transactions a second.  The technology that makes bitcoin so exciting also has a built in technical issue that means the upper limit of bitcoin transactions is about seven a second. That's not very useful for the future of money. And of course this is all unregulated, it's really the financial wild west.  I've met people who've turned £500 into £200,000 but I've also talked to people who made and lost thousands too.  If something goes wrong with a digital currency there's no-one to turn to.  And mixed in with all this are people using these currencies to buy drugs, extort money and build scams and Ponzi schemes. But as I said at the start it's all extremely seductive as an investment idea, surely we can all be rich?  Well maybe some people will get rich just as some people win the lottery.  But to misquote the old lottery slogan, it probably won't be you. And you could lose everything.",0.10188333333333334,0.061600708319458325

53,Tech Tent: What a year for Bitcoin,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42454876,2017-12-22 16:02:54+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Rejoice everyone, it is that time of the year again. This week's edition of Tech Tent is our annual festive quiz - and although I am writing this before taking part on one of the teams, I suspect that Bitcoin will feature among the questions. What a year it has been for the crypto-currency, which started 2017 worth less than $1,000 and by last weekend had climbed to within a few dollars of the $20,000 mark. For all of that period, sceptics have been predicting that the bubble would burst and in the past 24 hours it has seemed at times that this was happening. The price, which has been sinking all week, fell more than 10% in a matter of hours, dipping towards $13,000 before staging a partial recovery. Though as someone commented, it is moving so fast, any Bitcoin article is out of date five minutes after it is written. What is worrying is that we are at the stage in a bubble where people have been rushing in without much thought and with little understanding either of how Bitcoin works or the risks involved. Earlier this week while filming a report for the BBC News at Ten, we visited a Bitcoin cash machine in a cafe at a London Tube station. I'd been here before when it appeared to be scarcely used but this time a steady stream of people - mostly young men - arrived to stick £20 notes in the machine and get a tiny fraction of a Bitcoin in exchange. Most did not want to speak but one told me he had got about £10,000 invested in various crypto-currencies. When I asked what he would do if the bubble did burst, he insisted: ""I'll hold it. I have faith that it will go back up. Even if it collapses, I'm going to hold it.""       Over on Reddit on Friday, there was a sudden dawning of awareness that markets can go down as well as up: ""Argued with my wife for months to buy,"" wrote one man. ""Finally get approval to buy $1,000 at $19,400."" This was followed by an expletive. These wild swings in Bitcoin's value are making it ever more evident that it is not really a currency - there are very few places that accept it and why would you spend it if you thought it would be worth more tomorrow? At our BBC editorial meeting, there was a discussion about whether we should continue to use the term ""crypto-currency"" when Bitcoin so clearly does not operate as a means of exchange - though we decided commodity or speculative asset did not quite do the job. It does now feel  that something has got to give as the frenzy spreads from Bitcoin to other ""currencies"" and to the blockchain technology that underpins them. This week the drinks company Long Island Iced Tea saw its shares soar by more than 400%  after it changed its name to Long Island Blockchain - proof, surely, that the crypto-craziness is now reaching terminal velocity. That is certainly the view of David Gerard, whose book Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain is a very convincing takedown of the whole phenomenon. He is worried about the people who have got caught up late in the day: ""This is how economic bubbles  work - people buy because other people are buying and they assume they can sell and get rich. When the bubble pops - and it's when not if - it's going to be a disaster for a lot of people."" One worry is that when people do try to rush for the exit they find it blocked.  I have been selling some of the Bitcoin I bought 18 months ago, paying about £60.  In theory that is simple enough and indeed I have sold £500 worth for a small fee. But actually getting that cash into my sterling bank account is far from seamless - so far I am a week in to what promises to be a two-week process.  Hardly the frictionless finance that was promised by Bitcoin's advocates and if the rush to sell gathers pace there is a good chance that the system seizes up completely. Let me end by wishing all Tech Tent listeners a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I expect the crypto-craze and the blockchain bubble will continue to provide us with stories throughout 2018.",0.15158461538461537,0.06891663891663892
54,Bitcoin: Should we care about its price?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42435995,2017-12-21 12:14:40+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"On Wednesday, cryptocurrency Bitcoin fell by about 10% to a value of $15,800 (£11,810).   ""It has plunged,"" a colleague said. ""Should we do a story?"" Business journalists (or at least some of them) will debate passionately whether something is indeed a plunge, a dive, or merely a fall, a dip or a retreat. It's what makes us great company at parties. And sure, a 10% movement downwards would usually fall into one of the more dramatic descriptions.  But to give it some perspective, Bitcoin dropping to $15,800 on 20 December took it to its lowest level since, well, 11 December. Which means we are not debating the terminology, but whether or not we should report, blow-by-blow, how Bitcoin is performing at all.    Nobody could accuse the media of ignoring Bitcoin and its rivals, at least not recently. The BBC, like many others, has referred regularly to the skyrocketing price over the past year, including it almost doubling in value over the past month or so. And it seems almost daily there is a legitimate news story: just this week there have been probes about insider trading,Bitcoin crime stories and people asking for Bitcoin as a wedding gift to pick three at random from our website. So there is little doubt cryptocurrencies have entered the mainstream consciousness and news agenda.   Both the currencies, and the technology behind them, seem sure to become more prevalent in the global economy.  The possibilities which that opens up, as well as the risks, is surely worth investigating.  Governments around the world are weighing in with their opinions on regulation. Some well-respected figures have warned that Bitcoin is a bubble that carries a big risk for investors. These seem reasonable things to report, as well as reflecting the more optimistic point of view. Meanwhile the trading of Bitcoin on a huge futures market such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is also interesting and worth covering, in that it marks a big step towards mainstream investing. But should we be reporting specifically on the price, where the news is essentially: price goes up, price goes down? It is tempting because Bitcoin stories are popular. And some people do clearly want to know.  That list includes investors of course, and anyone wanting to buy, sell or just indulge in one of those ""If only I'd invested five years/five months/five weeks ago"" internal monologues. If that is you, fear not. Plenty of services can tell you what the price of Bitcoin is doing right this second. The BBC tends to use Coindesk as its reference point. There have been occasions when we decided the price was worth marking - most recently, for example, when it crossed the $10,000 threshold. But is choosing not to report on what some see as significant on-the-day price movements a kind of cryptocurrency snobbery?  Well firstly, while we have currency market data pages using information bought from a third party, the BBC does not usually get involved in the nitty-gritty reporting of daily currency market movements.  And if we do write or broadcast about what the dollar, sterling and the euro are up to, it is only when somebody judges it editorially significant.   Sometimes it is when that movement is the result of some other newsworthy event (the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit referendum springs to mind).  And of course the value of established physical currencies still has far more impact on people's lives - be they running a business, have savings and investments, be going on holiday or indeed buying anything that has been made abroad. So after a bit of a discussion in the BBC's Singapore office, here are few reasons why we feel reluctant to do stories based on the price movements in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency: Incidentally, at the time of writing on Thursday, Bitcoin has bounced back from that ""plunge"" of yesterday to above $17,100. Which is higher than it was 24 hours ago. So no. I don't think we should do a story. ",0.14417878787878788,0.07158349366682701
55,The Indian wedding that bet on Bitcoin,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42390013,2017-12-20 00:33:07+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"When Prashant Sharma and Niti Shree were planning to marry, they decided to ask for something unusual as a wedding present - the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.  The couple, who live in the south Indian city of Bangalore, are founders of a digital start-up and many of their friends also work for technology companies.   ""So we thought of merging technology with gifting for the future,"" said Mr Sharma. ""We explained it to our parents and they were very receptive.""  The wedding took place on 9 December, just four days after India's central bank issued its third warning cautioning investors against buying Bitcoins.  But that didn't seem to discourage their friends and family.  There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept Bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  Only 15 of the nearly 200 wedding guests gave the happy couple ""traditional gifts"".  Mr Sharma estimates they received Bitcoin worth 100,000 rupees ($1,559; £1,169).  ""The concept is good,"" said one relative who gifted them Bitcoin but did not wish to reveal his name. ""I am sure its acceptance will improve though many governments may not like it now.""  ""Prashant and Niti did not decide on Bitcoin as a gift in the last couple of weeks,"" said Ravi Shankar, another guest. ""It was planned a couple of months ago.""  The recent surge in the price of Bitcoin has led many to wonder if it is a bubble.  Mr Sharma said this did not worry him much.  ""If you buy something to sell it later then you are creating a bubble. We bought Bitcoin because we wanted to see how this technology moves forward,"" he said.  ""Bitcoin is not the only thing that has potential. Blockchain technology is the real deal,"" he added.  Blockchain, the technology underpinning Bitcoin, is a method of recording data - a digital ledger of transactions, agreements and contracts. Many banks have said it could transform the future of financial transactions.  ""The disruptive potential of blockchain technology is so huge that it just cannot be banned,"" Mr Sharma said. Experts say they can understand why regulators are concerned.  ""Regulators find that there is not enough transparency in the ownership and management of cryptocurrency,"" said Pranjal Sharma, an economic analyst.  ""It is not that they are bull-headed or orthodox. Governments just want to be careful.""  Mr Sharma said he and his wife will sell the Bitcoins they have received to fund initiatives that educate underprivileged children.",0.14849629629629632,0.08955828122494787
56,Bitcoin: South Korea sways cryptocurrency prices - but how?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42713314,2018-01-17 07:16:19+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"South Korea's government has been signalling that it plans to crack down on cryptocurrency trading.  Exactly how it will do this remains vague. But just the threat of action has been enough to drive a sell-off across the market globally.  Bitcoin, for example, has lost nearly a quarter of its value in the past week.  And so on Wednesday the virtual currency - which last month looked set to breach the $20,000 (£14,500) mark - was trading closer to $12,000. Prices of cryptocurrencies are volatile at the best of time. Rises and falls of 10% or more in a day are not uncommon. And pinning down rationale for those sharp movements often involves guesswork.  But it seems that events in one relatively small Asian nation can have a significant effect on the market. South Korea is the third-biggest market in the world for Bitcoin trades, behind Japan and the US, according to the digital currency website Coinhills. That's an estimate made by looking at counting the volume of Bitcoins that have been exchanged for various currencies. Of course, a buyer could be sitting in Singapore or Serbia while using South Korean won to trade, but the Coinhills breakdown is pretty much the best we have to go on. The Korea Blockchain Industry Association estimates that South Korea has more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges.  And there's so much demand that the virtual currency has traded at as much as a 30% premium compared with other countries. Taken together, you get a decent feel for how big this industry has become in a country of fewer than 50 million people.  Amid tales of schoolchildren and housewives rushing in to buy virtual currency, South Korea's government has branded the trend ""irrational"". And so when trading exchanges are being raided by the tax authorities and your justice minister mentions potential bans on all cryptocurrency trading, it is perhaps little wonder that the industry globally is noticing and that markets are responding. Many South Koreans, especially among the younger generations, are digital-loving and tech-savvy, which makes digital currencies something appealing to explore and perhaps dabble in.  The country has first-class infrastructure for IT networks and offers very fast internet connections - all things which make trading cryptocurrencies easier and faster.  According to analytics firm WiseApp, the number of cryptocurrency app users in South Korea has increase 14-fold in the past three months to about two million users.  Most are in their 30s with users spending an average of 26 minutes on the apps daily.  The huge price rises enjoyed by many virtual currencies during 2017, and the associated media coverage, is a major reason so many worldwide have decided to invest in, or gamble with, this new technology.  In South Korea it's suggested this appeal has been amplified by the state of the economy which has been slowing in recent years. Rising unemployment, especially among young people, is also being linked with a growing number of people looking at new ways to try and make money. So unsurprisingly, with so many South Koreans keen to fulfil their financial hopes and dreams through cryptocurrency trades, there is resistance to plans for a crypto-clampdown. More than 200,000 people have now signed a petition on President Moon Jae-in's official website asking that the ""happy dreams"" of Bitcoin traders in South Korea can remain in place.  South Korea's government has made a commitment to answer such petitions that reach more than 200,000 signatures within 30 days. Meaning this debate has a long way to run.",0.16755357142857144,0.11875946969696971
57,Bitcoin: 'I'm part of a crazy wave',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42281004,2017-12-08 22:05:54+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"In its early days, Bitcoin might have been dismissed as a quirky tech sector fad.  But it is rapidly evolving into the mainstream and has already made some people rich. If once Bitcoin was seen as a tool for money launderers and drug dealers, it has recently become as commonplace a topic at middle-class dinner parties as house prices. There are advertisements on the London Underground proposing ways to invest. It's been on the newspaper front pages.  There are anecdotes of taxi drivers who say they've borrowed money to buy Bitcoin.  And every day, another expert cautions investors that these are just the kinds of things to watch out for if you want to avoid investing in a bubble that's about to burst. So who is still holding onto their Bitcoins, as the price continues to fluctuate? Alessandra Sollberger, 29, first invested in Bitcoin in 2012 when each was worth about $9. She had been reading about it on tech blogs. She says she was intrigued by the concept of this new ""libertarian and decentralised perspective"". ""I thought, I can put a little bit into it, because I wanted to have a bit of a stake in something I found exciting. A way to be part of what was happening."" When its value rallied in 2013, she began to cash in her investment.  ""I had made nine times my investment, which I was pretty satisfied with,"" she says. She took out £20,000 to start her own London-based ""superfoods"" business, Evermore Health. Over the years, her Bitcoin stake has yielded £80,000 to support her business. She's cashed in some to treat herself to a kite-surfing holiday in Zanzibar in the new year. But she still owns the equivalent of about 20 whole Bitcoins, around $300,000 worth, although she has diversified into other digital currencies to hedge her bets. ""It's about being part of this crazy wave,"" she says. But she thinks there's a lot of hype. And she's not convinced that out of all the different cryptocurrencies out there, Bitcoin will necessarily be the one that prevails. ""There are currencies that have gone up more than Bitcoin has,"" she says. pointing out that often the groundbreaking first version of a new technology is overtaken by better models as the market develops.  So does she allow Bitcoin payments at her own business? ""We're thinking about it for next year,"" she says. Danny Lenihan is a recent investor in Bitcoin and another similar digital currency, Ethereum. The 45-year-old entrepreneur says he's already doubled his initial investment, but his lack of experience with technology and finance was a barrier at first. ""The biggest thing was finding out how to buy Bitcoin,"" he says. ""It feels like a real trap, you don't know what's genuine and what's not."" Danny, who lives in Bedford, believes that investing has been a good choice, but he's wary of the risk it can be for some people. ""You tend to get a bit reckless if you see a little bit of success,"" he says. ""You can get cocky and I think it's when people get the head rush and lose that clinical assessment, that's when people make mistakes."" He's less certain about the future. ""Obviously the whole thing could go up in a puff of smoke, as nobody has any real clue what will happen. ""There's no trading history, we're not looking at commodities like oil where there are trading patterns that go back centuries,"" he adds. ""The more I read differing opinions on whether Bitcoin is a bubble, or the reincarnation of the Tulip bubble in the 1600s, the more I realise that nobody knows anything and on a day-to-day basis it's all just a big gamble."" But so far, Danny says, his gamble is paying off, and he's optimistic about the relevance of cryptocurrencies in years to come. ""We're all trading data - who keeps cash anymore? Bitcoin for me is just another currency I don't have in my pocket."" Saad Naja, 25, is cagey about exactly how much he's made from investing in Bitcoin and other digital currencies, but he will admit it is about six figures and certainly ""enough to give up work"" if he wanted to. And he has recently left his day job, but not to lounge around on the beach. Instead, early next year he's launching a hedge fund investing purely in cryptocurrencies. The Londoner started out ""mining"" Bitcoins, which is how the currency is created, on his laptop from his student dorm room five years ago. Until he was threatened with eviction, that is, because of his soaring electricity consumption. After graduation, he worked for Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank before moving to Gain Capital. But by this year, he was making more from his crypto-sideline than he was at work and ""it didn't make sense"" to stay. ""I'm not really sure how much I need to work again,"" he says. Despite the warnings from much of the investment community that Bitcoin is riding for a fall, he is confident.  ""Bitcoin has a loyal and devout following that's the backbone of it at the moment,"" he says. ""It will fluctuate in price. A correction is imminent, but the general trajectory is up."" Even his 70-year-old mum has spotted that, he says. Recently she told him he should be investing in it.  ""She said: I want to buy some. How do I do it?"" He told her not to worry - he had that covered.",0.10901914893617021,0.09693826563507416

The artwork, by Rob Myers and @coin_artist, who uses a pseudonym, was first published online in early 2015. A code contained within it revealed a private key that granted its discoverer access to the wallet full of bitcoins. And the bitcoins were finally removed from the wallet last week. Technology website Motherboard reported that a 30-year-old programmer had claimed the funds after searching online for puzzles to do with crypto-currencies. Motherboard added that the programmer said they lived in a country where it was ""not safe"" to own Bitcoin and therefore wanted to keep their name secret. The puzzle encoded a string of binary - a series of zeroes and ones - in complicated rows of flames painted around the edge of the canvas. The colour and shape of each flame determined a four-character chunk of the binary series, with a further part of the code represented by six ribbons of different lengths in the bottom right-hand corner. After all of these codes had been worked out and linked together, the successful puzzle-solver was able to translate the full string of zeroes and ones into a Bitcoin private key with the help of a simple computer program. It wasn't surprising that it had taken so long for someone to solve the painting's code, said Peter Todd, a cryptography consultant. ""Puzzles like that one aren't things you can just throw computing power at - they're genuine brain puzzles,"" he told the BBC. This is not the first time someone has claimed bitcoins after cracking a puzzle set by their original owner. In January, a Belgian PhD student worked out a key to a single bitcoin - then worth more than $10,000 - after decoding a strand of synthetic DNA. And two hackers claimed $1,000 in Bitcoin late last year after reconstructing a partially blurred-out QR code that had briefly appeared on French television.",0.11269285714285714,0.08140306122448979
59,Why African millennials can't get enough of Bitcoin,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42582343,2018-01-08 01:54:08+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin's eye-watering price surge over the past year is proving too tempting to resist despite fears that cryptocurrencies are a bubble floating towards an inevitable burst. One group for whom it holds particular appeal is African millennials, writes the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga from Uganda. Thirty year-old Peace Akware in Kampala is a convert to the cryptocurrency craze.  Like any self-respecting middle class millennial here her smartphone is always within reach and with it her digital wallet.  ""I check my Bitcoin every day and any chance I can get.  Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can,"" she tells me from the small bungalow she rents on the outskirts of Kampala.  Finding a job here is almost like a lottery for graduates so Ugandans often have so-called side hustles.  Peace has sold clothes and even got into money lending. Both failed.  But buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin appeals to her because it requires less of her time and there are no upfront costs.  She's bought more than a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin.  So far the gamble is paying off and overall she is seeing her digital value rise.   ""You know there's potential for it growing even further. I would like to buy a car. I would like to buy land. I would like to build with it."" It's not just those hoping to get rich quick who are getting in on the action.  In parts of the continent - especially commercial hubs like Lagos, Nairobi and Johannesburg - a small but growing number of people are finding that cryptocurrencies offer a cheaper solution to an expensive problem - transferring funds across borders.  The technology platform Bitpesa uses Bitcoin as a medium to transfer cash across borders. It is like a remittance company.  With traditional remittance companies like Western Union, when you transfer money initially it goes from your local currency into dollars then on the other side they receive dollars which are then converted into the local currency.  You lose a lot of money in that conversion.  What Bitpesa does is substitute the dollars with Bitcoin.  It is cheaper, especially when there is a shortage of dollars in the country or restrictions on accessing dollars.  It is also quicker because you don't have to go through long complicated bank approvals.  Five African tech trends to look out for in 2018 The computer that can smell explosives Africa needs more engineers and makers How African governments block social media Elizabeth Rossiello is the CEO of Bitpesa. Even as someone who knows how the finance world works, she gets frustrated with traditional banking. ""I've been in Nairobi for the past month and I had three big banking things to do.  ""All three of these operations with three different Kenyan banks were cancelled for different reasons, or had delays or needed additional information so it took almost two-and-a-half weeks per transaction to get them finalised and I'm an expert."" Bitpesa has been operating for four years now and has over 6,000 customers across the continent.  It focuses on big-ticket transfers - for example, paying suppliers in China or employees in another country.  In Nigeria, when the government placed controls on access to the US dollar during a financial crunch, Bitcoin made it much easier for businesses to transfer cash abroad, something that has increased interest in cryptocurrencies in the country.  In places like Zimbabwe, where there has been political and economic instability, Bitcoin has become a place to store value, buy goods and services from abroad and crucially a vehicle for remittances from the diaspora. Many central banks are sceptical.  The Nigerian, Kenyan and Ugandan central banks have issued warnings about getting involved in the new and unregulated market.  The governor of the Central Bank of Kenya went as far as saying digital currencies are a type of Ponzi scheme because of the way their value often fluctuates.  Martin Serugga, a sharply dressed currency trader in Kampala warns people to be cautious too.  He says unfamiliarity about the new financial instruments could lead to criminals duping customers out of their money.  Nevertheless, he has started weekly classes with over 50 people attending to learn about cryptocurrencies and how to trade them against traditional currencies like the US dollar or British pound.  He says high youth unemployment in Uganda is driving interest in Bitcoin and other products. ""If you don't have factory jobs and you don't have corporate jobs to serve the thousands of young people coming out of the universities this is an alternative,"" he says. Mr Serugga's class is made up of equal numbers of men and women, who are mostly young.  They come to an upmarket coffee shop for their dose of the financial markets.  The bright projector on the screen flashes numbers, graphs and bright colours.  Joachim Ndhokero, a recent economics graduate, is still unemployed.  His father encouraged him to attend the classes to make some money but it has not been easy.  He lost over $900 (£664) in a trade gone wrong.  Before he lost all his money, he had just made a $200 profit.  Then he went to the cinema and lost everything. ""I think it was within like two hours.  ""That day I learnt that for cryptocurrencies, since they have a bigger spread, they can easily bring in losses.  If it's a loss, it's really a loss."" The expert advice here is ""use what you can afford to lose"".  But it's not just the currency aspect of this technology that people think will transform the continent.  Digital security expert Neil Blazevic sees the blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrencies as the more important innovation.  Blockchain is a form of recording data that cannot be tampered with or hacked. It can be used for documents from contracts drawn up by lawyers to land registries.   He lists many more applications. ""If African developers, entrepreneurs, and governments can leverage blockchain technologies, they may have a shot at tackling some of the continent's most intractable problems of the unbanked masses, digital identities, untrusted voting systems, to name only a few applications,"" Mr Blazevic explains. ""With the right support for innovation, and collaboration Africa could once again leapfrog over the digital divide and become a market leader just like it did in the move from landline communications infrastructure to the mobile phone ecosystem."" One person who has fully embraced the African mobile phone revolution is Ms Akware.  She continues to watch over her digital wallet.  She knows that the value of Bitcoin could fall at any moment.  If all fails she will probably start again from scratch with a new venture.  For the moment she is holding on, hoping to buy her first car in two months. ",0.06603225806451614,0.024342387003677322
60,Tech Tent: Will crypto-crime end the Bitcoin bubble?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42917172,2018-02-02 16:44:39+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"On Friday, Japanese regulators staged a raid on the offices of Coincheck, a crypto-currency exchange that has been hit by what could be the biggest bank heist in history.  On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we ask whether a crime wave hitting the crypto-currency industry is sapping confidence in the whole project.  The Japanese regulators wanted to know just what kind of security measures were in place when hackers stole $530m (£375m) worth of crypto-currencies from Coincheck. On Tuesday, America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received a court order to close down an initial coin offering (ICO), which encourage people to buy into new crypto-currencies before they launch, which was aiming to raise $1bn. The SEC said the plan to create a new currency to fund what was called a decentralised bank was a scam. And this week, the cyber-security firm Digital Shadows produced a report on the latest fashion in cyber-crime: profiting from the crypto-currency boom. The report - titled The New Gold Rush - details the various types of scam, from fake ICOs to raids on exchanges to simple phishing attacks. Its author, Becky Pinkard, tells Tech Tent that cyber-criminals have decided to jump on the bandwagon as the frenzy of popular excitement about the rise in value of Bitcoin has grown. ""We have people all the way down to my grandmother asking about Bitcoin and what it means and whether I can make money from it,"" she says.  ""What that does is then create the type of exposure that criminals need in order to come in and take advantage of folks who don't really know what they're doing."" Digital Shadows has been scouring criminal forums on the dark web and has found plenty of conversations about ICOs - and how to profit from them.  ""Just set it up, people will come and they will drop the money on you,"" said one comment. The mood about ICOs and other manifestations of the crypto-currency boom certainly seems to have shifted this week. Facebook has announced that it is to ban all adverts promoting any kind of crypto-currency product. Meanwhile there has been a sudden slew of prominent thinkers casting doubt on everything from the value of Bitcoin to the significance of the blockchain technology underpinning it.  The boss of MIT's Media Lab, Joi Ito, wrote a piece headlined The Big ICO Swindle. The respected economist Nouriel Roubini weighed in with Blockchain's Broken Promises, casting doubt on a technology that proponents claim has great potential, whatever happens to Bitcoin. Such downbeat assessments, combined with growing regulatory pressure, seem to be having an effect. Bitcoin and other so-called altcoins have taken another sharp lurch downwards in recent days,.

Bitcoin's value passed a record $11,000 (£8,200) on Wednesday after a sharp but often volatile rise this year.  Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy for financial stability, said that when prices grow so fast, ""investors should do their homework and think carefully"". But he added that Bitcoin's rise was not big enough to unsettle the economy. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or government. Bitcoin hit a high of $11,377 on one major exchange on Wednesday, an increase of more than 1,000% from the start of the year. The digital currency - which works like virtual tokens - has fluctuated wildly since it was launched in 2009. Critics have said it is going through a bubble similar to the dot com boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. Asked about the surge, Sir Jon told the BBC: ""People need to be clear this is not an official currency. No central bank stands behind it, no government stands behind it.""  He said it was ""closer to a commodity"" than a currency, with people choosing to invest and trade in it. Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million. Despite its price rise, Sir Jon said Bitcoin was ""not of a size that would be a threat to financial stability"" or a risk to the UK economy. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. US regulators have moved towards treating some of them as currencies, whereas Korean regulators see them as commodities. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".

63,Bitcoin slump sees trades suspended on certain exchanges,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42457983,2017-12-22 21:43:30+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website, before recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000.  It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start.  ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm to halt buying and selling twice. The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future.  The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks, markets have been rattled by hacks and allegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said.  A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million.  Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment.  One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin.

The value of one bitcoin fell to $9,958 (£7,222) before making a slight recovery, according to a price index run by the news site Coindesk. However, it later fell again dipping just below $9,200. That represents a drop of more than 53% since it peaked close to $19,800 five weeks ago.  Other crypto-currencies have also experienced steep falls, including Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. There has been concern among some experts that a bubble had been forming in the market as casual investors piled into an asset they did not fully understand. It is notoriously difficult to be certain of what causes moves in Bitcoin's value - the asset has been much more volatile than most traditional currencies and commodities to date - but speculation that regulators may be about to restrict trade has been causing concern. In particular, South Korea has suggested that it might soon take action. ""The government stance is that it needs to regulate crypto-currency investment as it is a largely speculative investment,"" its finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a radio interview on Tuesday. ""The shutdown of virtual currency exchanges is still one of the options [that the government has]."" Earlier this week, the Bloomberg news agency reported that the Chinese authorities were planning to restrict local access to crypto-currency trading platforms, having already taken steps to curb Bitcoin mining - the process that validates transactions. Investors may also have been spooked by Bitconnect's announcement that it was closing down its lending and exchange platform on Tuesday. The business had centred on its own digital token - the Bitconnect Coin - which crashed in value following the announcement, despite the firm saying it would still be supported. Bitconnect said it had faced ""continuous bad press"" - including claims it had been running a Ponzi scheme -  and had received cease-and-desist letters from two US watchdogs. Last Wednesday, the influential investor Warren Buffett predicted further trouble ahead, although he was vague about the timing. ""In terms of crypto-currencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,"" he told CNBC . ""When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know.""

65,Bitcoin exchange Youbit shuts after second hack attack,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42409815,2017-12-19 11:02:19+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A crypto-currency exchange in South Korea is shutting down after it was hacked for the second time in less than eight months. Youbit, which lets people buy and sell bitcoins and other virtual currencies, has filed for bankruptcy after losing 17% of its assets in the cyber-attack. It did not disclose how much the assets were worth at the time of the attack. In April, Youbit, formerly called Yapizon, lost 4,000 bitcoins now worth $73m (£55m) to cyberthieves. South Korea's Internet and Security Agency (Kisa) which investigates net crime, said it had started an enquiry into how the thieves gained access to the exchange's core systems. Kisa blamed the earlier attack on Youbit on cyber-spies working for North Korea. Separate, more recent, attacks on the Bithumb and Coinis exchanges, have also been blamed on the regime. No information has been released about who might have been behind the latest Youbit attack. In a statement, Youbit said that customers would get back about 75% of the value of the crypto-currency they have lodged with the exchange. It said it was ""very sorry"" that it had been forced to shut down. The exchange added that the hackers did not manage to steal all the digital cash it held because a lot was lodged in a ""cold wallet"" - a secure store used to hold the assets that were not being traded.  Youbit was one of the smaller exchanges active in South Korea. The majority of Bitcoin trading in the country is done on the Bithumb exchange which has a 70% market share. More and more cybercriminals have tried to cash in on the boom in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Many have created malware that seeks to use victims' computers to create or ""mine"" valuable currencies. Others have simply attacked exchanges and other crypto-cash service firms to get at large numbers of bitcoins at once.  Earlier this month, hackers got away with more than $80m in bitcoins from NiceHash, a Slovenia-based mining exchange.",-0.12292941176470587,0.06346093993152815
66,Bitcoin trading starts on the huge CME exchange,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42386893,2017-12-18 03:14:36+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin has moved another step towards mainstream investing with the start of trading on the huge Chicago Mercantile Exchange financial futures market. It comes as the value of the digital currency approached $20,000 on Sunday, before drifting below $19,000. Last week, Chicago's CBOE exchange began Bitcoin futures trading - bets on a future price - but CME is far bigger. On Sunday, the chairman of UBS bank and former Bundesbank head Axel Weber joined the chorus of Bitcoin warnings. ""Bitcoin is not money,"" he said in an interview, and urged regulators to intervene.  Meanwhile the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called for the issue to be discussed at the G20 summit of major economies in April.  ""There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin"", Mr Maire told the French news channel LCI.  Bitcoin prices have surged this year: a single bitcoin stood at less than $1,000 in January and hit a record $19,783 on Sunday, according to Coindesk. Analysts believe CME's entry into the Bitcoin market will generate more interest in the crypto-currency, possibly pushing the price higher.  The CBOE futures contract is based on a closing price of Bitcoin from the Gemini exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. However, the CME contract price will be culled from multiple exchanges, potentially offering investors more transparency about the value.  ""The CME [futures] contract is based on a broader array of exchanges,"" said Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris, which has $2.5bn in alternative investments.   ""So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. ""Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility."" Institutional investors are prohibited from buying Bitcoin directly because the market is unregulated, but they can buy futures contracts. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  CBOE Bitcoin futures surged nearly 20% on their debut last Monday, and more than 4,000 contracts changed hands by the end of the day. But as interest in the digital currency increases, so do the warnings.  Mr Weber told the Swiss Sunday newspaper that investors should resist jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, saying the bubble would inevitably burst. He said Bitcoin does not fulfil the three main functions of money because, in his view: it is not an effective means of payment; it is not a good measure of value (since prices are not written in Bitcoin); and it is not an effective way to store value, since it is inherently unstable. UBS advises clients against investing in the virtual currency, he said, because the bank does ""not consider it valuable and not sustainable"". To protect investors who do not take the bank's advice, ""regulators are needed,"" Mr Weber said. However, many people say financial regulation is difficult, if not impossible, because transparency was not part of Bitcoin's creation. Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by an individual or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden.

67,Virgin Money joins ban on buying Bitcoin on credit cards,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42940728,2018-02-05 17:43:09+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Virgin Money has joined Lloyds Banking Group in banning customers from buying Bitcoin and other digital currencies with their credit cards. Virgin Money's spokesperson said: ""Following a review of our policies, I can confirm customers will no longer be able to use their Virgin Money credit card to purchase crypto-currencies.""  Like Lloyds, Virgin's ban only applies to its credit cards, not debit cards. The value of Bitcoin fell a further 10.86% to $7,297.65 on Monday. Like Lloyds, Virgin Money is concerned about customers running up large debts following a sharp fall in the value of digital currencies. Over the weekend, several of the biggest issuers of credit cards in the US also banned customers from using their cards to buy digital currency. The list of financial firms included Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Capital One and Discover. Lloyds' ban, starting on Monday, applies to its eight million credit card customers across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA.  Lloyds said it would not be contacting its customers either digitally or through the post to inform customers about the change to its credit card policy. Customers will only be informed should they query a blocked crypto-currency credit card transaction.  Explaining the ban, a Lloyds spokeswoman said: ""We continually review our products and procedures and this is part of that."" The BBC asked other major banks about following Lloyds' move, but none had so far responded. The banking trade organisation UK Finance said it had not released any guidance on the matter. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, welcomed the announcement by Lloyds, saying it ""shows they recognise the risks of credit card customers running up debt they can't afford,"" she said.  Barclays told the BBC that at present, UK customers are able to use both their Barclays debit cards and Barclaycard credit cards to purchase crypto-currencies. ""We take precautions to assess affordability before extending credit, flag and prevent any suspicious transactions and also closely monitor credit risk,"" a spokeswoman said.  Bitcoin ended last week down 30% at $8,291.87 - its worst week since April 2013 and far below the $19,000 it reached last November. However, the crypto-currency is still ahead of the $1,000 it was trading at this time last year. Police have warned that digital currencies remain popular among criminals as they can use them to evade traditional money laundering checks and other regulations.  Recent reports from Chinese state media indicate that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten legislation to prevent investors in the country from accessing overseas exchanges to trade in crypto-currencies. Prime Minister Theresa May recently said that action against digital currencies may be required ""precisely because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals"". She told Bloomberg: ""In areas like crypto-currencies, like Bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously."" The Treasury said that it intends to update regulation to bring virtual currency platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation. Facebook recently announced it would block any advertising that promotes crypto-currency products and services. Lloyds' decision to stop the use of credit cards to buy Bitcoin appears to set a new precedent in banking. Until now, there have been only two things you can't use a credit card for: paying off debt - such as making a mortgage payment - or anything illegal. Most stockbrokers will not allow you to use a credit card to buy shares, but that is their decision, not the bank's. Nevertheless, you can use a credit card to gamble - although that will be treated as a cash loan, with interest charges of up to 30% a year, and additional fees on top. But Lloyds has decided that Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies represent a far bigger risk than gambling.  After all, you're buying on credit, so it's the bank that stands to lose if you can't repay the debt. Do you use Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Have you made or lost money?

Both the United States and South Korea claim they have won the race to launch the first commercial next-generation mobile network. On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we assess those claims and ask how important it is to be first with this technology. South Korea was long expected to be first with 5G. It is a technological powerhouse with ultra-fast broadband, home to giant firms such as Samsung and a government that sees leading the world in connectivity as a matter of national pride.  Three networks were due to launch commercial 5G services on Friday when news emerged that an American operator was trying to steal their thunder. With quite a fanfare, Verizon launched its service on Wednesday in very limited areas of Chicago and Minneapolis.  So the South Korean operators moved their launches forward to the same day, although it appeared that only a handful of celebrities were able to use it on the first day. In both South Korea and the US, these are largely symbolic launches because just about nobody has a 5G-enabled mobile phone yet. But Ronan Dunne, president of Verizon Wireless, told Tech Tent that more than 30 US cities would be covered by the end of 2019. Half a dozen 5G handsets will be available. ""We think the adoption rate and the pace at which coverage will grow will be even faster than we have seen in the past,"" he said. Telecoms expert Simon Forrest, from Futuresource Consulting, still thinks South Korea will make faster progress rolling out 5G than the United States, partly because the operators there have united to build the network. ""They're working in unison to deliver services, whereas in somewhere like the US, each of those operators is competing with the other and building their own separate networks."" He explains that South Korea and many other countries are using parts of the wireless spectrum best suited to reasonably fast, fairly wide coverage. This is known as the coverage capacity layer. In the United States, these ideal frequencies are largely occupied by the Department of Defense. Verizon is instead relying on millimetre wave, which offers very high speeds in a limited area. That means building a lot of new masts and that may be easier in some places than others. When 4G arrived, Asian countries were well ahead when it came to rolling out the new networks. This time the United States and Europe look well-prepared and a number of operators are planning to launch 5G in the second half of this year. What is still far from clear is just how eager consumers will be to pay for a technology that has been marketed as a solution for connecting things rather than people to the internet.

69,India warns on Bitcoin as investors rush in,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-42266568,2017-12-08 00:06:41+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The digital currency Bitcoin is rallying at phenomenal speed, leaving many high and others dry in markets around the world. But why are prices higher in India than elsewhere? The BBC's Devina Gupta explains. While the Bitcoin bull run has been welcomed by many, financial regulators in emerging economies are still trying to find a way to understand it. The central bank of China has shut down Bitcoin exchanges in the country. Indonesia and Bangladesh have banned its use as a payment tool.   In India the government has made it clear that, while it doesn't recognise Bitcoin as ""legal tender"" like paper money, there are no guidelines on Bitcoin trading. In the absence of any specific legal framework, online Bitcoin trading platforms are operating freely, even as the Indian central bank is getting jittery. It has issued its third warning this week, cautioning ""users, holders and traders of virtual currencies including Bitcoin"" of ""economic, financial, operational, legal, consumer protection and security-related risks"".  But is anyone listening? Experts claim that demand outweighs supply in India, pushing the Bitcoin price in the country up to 20% higher than international prices. There are at least 11 Indian Bitcoin trading platforms online which claim that about 30,000 customers are actively trading at any given point of time. With a simple click, an investor can open an account and choose whether to purchase an entire Bitcoin or a fraction to trade with.   There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.  Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept Bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.  However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.  ""Last year this time we had 100,000 registered customers. Now we have gone up to 850,000. The price is surging and from my analysis the people who are investing in Bitcoins are investors who have big pockets and are willing to take risks on their portfolio,"" Satvik Vishwanathan, co-founder of Unocoin, told the BBC. And it's not just online trading. Some Indian e-commerce platforms have started recognising the digital currency as well. FlipKart and Amazon are already giving customers the option to convert Bitcoin into regular currency and purchase goods with it.    But at the end of the day, Bitcoin is just an open software with a digital code.  Is it more secure than depositing money in a bank? ""There is no architecture to hold the Bitcoins safely, so right now people are taking a physical print out and keeping that in a locker. What the government can do is start a global wallet registry so that we know who is transacting and where the transactions are being done. If my Bitcoin is stolen then with this global wallet at least you can track it,"" Vishal Gupta, co-founder of Diro Labs, told the BBC. But the time for just issuing warnings may be over. With the popularity of Bitcoin, other digital currencies like Ethereum and Litecoin are also attracting Indian investors. So is it time for the government to make its policy clear? ""There are revolutionary changes in this sector and huge progressive moves here. Technology is always ahead of government and is a big disruptor. It is important that we keep pace with technology and make regulatory changes. It is an issue that finance ministry has to debate and do inter-ministerial discussions to take it forward,"" Amitabh Kant, the CEO of India's premier think-tank Niti Aayog, told the BBC.  Every high has a low. A look at the past five years of Bitcoin shows several stomach-churning moments where it has tumbled by 40% to 50% in a single day without any warning. The April 2013 Bitcoin meltdown where the currency fell by over 70% overnight from $233 to $67 still haunts many.  But perhaps the biggest shot in the arm for Bitcoin investors is the recent green light from the US for futures trading. This decision has fuelled the recent Bitcoin rally.  But Wall Street banks are raising concerns and heavyweights like Warren Buffet have red flagged Bitcoin as ""a real bubble"". This leads us to the big question: Is the digital currency an idea whose time has come or is it destined for disaster?  Only time will tell. ",0.07175499999999999,0.059486507936507935
70,Bitcoin: Would you want to get paid in cryptocurrency?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42435838,2017-12-27 01:51:26+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin. Lots of people are talking about, but very few own it.  So how would you feel about getting paid in the high profile cryptocurrency?  From early next year, staff at Japanese internet firm GMO Group will be among the latest to find out how that feels. More than 4,000 employees are being given the option to receive a portion of their salary in Bitcoin. Critics say it is a marketing stunt, announced at a time when global interest in the financial technology has never been higher.  It also carries risks: the volatile currency slumped last week but has since rebounded by more than 50%. But what will it really mean for employer and employee? Bitcoin salaries are usually paid according to the digital currency's value at an agreed date and time. To keep the numbers simple, if the Bitcoin price was $10,000 and an employee opted to have $1,000 in the digital currency, they would receive 0.1 Bitcoin.  Employees who choose to sell right away would receive the same in cash as they would have been paid (so long as they had arranged for the sale to happen in advance).  But holding onto the cryptocurrency, be it for a day, a week or a year, would see its value go up or go down. That $1,000 may end up being worth $5,000. Or potentially next to nothing. And so some argue that paying wages in Bitcoin effectively encourages people to gamble. ""If an employee is receiving their salary in Bitcoin, they might as well be receiving lottery tickets"", said Massimo Massa, professor of finance at INSEAD. ""They are just participating in a game."" Staff must be made aware that ""there's no guarantee that its price will rise and there's no intrinsic value because there's nothing to back it up"", he said, adding such schemes could never be compulsory. Despite repeated warnings from renowned economists and analysts that a Bitcoin crash is looming, it seems more of us are willing to take a punt. Bitwage, a platform set up to convert salaries into cryptocurrency, gained thousands of new users this year as people got swept up in some rapid price rises. ""These days a lot of people are looking to get part, and sometimes all of their salary paid in Bitcoin"", said Bitwage founder Jonathan Chester. The company has this year processed $30m in wages for 20,000 users in the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia including staff from Google, Facebook, GE, Philips, the United Nations and the US Navy. Many of these workers had signed up for the service on their own. Mr Chester said he converts 15% of his own monthly salary and believes it is ""a way of accumulating Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies without worrying about whether you're buying at the right time"".    That is because people can theoretically reduce the risks of volatility because they ""only buy little bits over time"". It is a tricky one to generalise, and it seems inevitable that as the industry develops, so too will the tax rules. Wherever they are in the world, employees will usually be liable for income tax due on their Bitcoin wages, calculated on its value at the time the salary is paid. But just like with stock options, employees may need to pay capital gains tax if their Bitcoin has risen in value, depending on the tax jurisdiction. Some companies working in the cryptocurrency industry have been offering Bitcoin salaries for years.  After all, if you got in early and bought when the price was much lower, then it could be a smart move to use it now to pay wages.  But for others it is all about business strategy. Japan's GMO, for example, says it wants to get staff thinking about cryptocurrencies. It has recently expanded into cryptocurrency trading and crypto mining. And so it hopes that if at least some employees have direct personal experience of Bitcoin, it will help with ""nurturing and developing cryptocurrency literacy"". And that, it says is ""vital to the growth and expansion of our cryptocurrency business"". The digital payment industry is expanding, with new digital currencies emerging all the time.   At the Singapore based blockchain company TenX, staff usually have their base salary paid into their bank accounts, but their monthly bonus is paid in Pay tokens, the firm's own digital currency. The tokens, which can be traded on digital exchanges, were issued in an initial coin offering in June, allowing the company to raise $80m. TenX co-founder and president, Julian Hosp, said it did not make sense to buy Bitcoin to pay bonuses when the company already had its own currency. Paying bonuses in tokens can incentivises staff as Pay's value should rise in line with the company's success, Mr Hosp added. TenX community manager, Mike Ferrer, has gone further and opted to receive part of his base salary in Pay, on top of his monthly bonus. The 32-year-old has been investing in cryptocurrencies for some time, and accepts that there are huge risks, but says he only invests what he can afford. ""I visualise myself throwing in a pile of money and watching it burn in front of me, and if I can't feel comfortable with that then I know I've over invested"", Mr Ferrer said.",0.17771,0.11860299422799422
71,Bitcoin Cash deals frozen as insider trading is probed,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42425857,2017-12-20 12:06:59+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"One of the US's leading crypto-currency exchanges is carrying out an insider trading investigation. Coinbase fears its own workers may have exploited its move into Bitcoin Cash - a spin-off of the original Bitcoin. The San Francisco-based firm announced the move after Bitcoin Cash's price jumped. Coinbase began letting its users buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Tuesday in a surprise decision but has temporarily suspended trade. The company's chief executive intervened after several market watchers posted allegations of illegal activity on social media sites. Brian Armstrong responded that he had repeatedly warned his staff not to disclose its launch plans to family or friends or to trade in the digital asset themselves. ""It appears the price of Bitcoin Cash on other exchanges increased in the hours before our announcement,"" he wrote on the blogging platform Medium. ""If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies  -  directly or indirectly  - I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action."" Bitcoin Cash - which is no more tangible than Bitcoin itself - came into being in August after several developers became frustrated at lengthening transaction times for the original crypto-currency. Bitcoin Cash addressed this problem by tweaking the underlying technology - the blockchain - to allow bigger chunks of data to be processed at a time. Although there have been other Bitcoin splits before, this ""fork"" was unusual in that everyone who owned the original virtual currency was offered a matching sum of Bitcoin Cash. This effectively created money out of nothing. However, many exchanges, including Coinbase, initially refused to support the innovation, casting doubt on its prospects. Claims of insider dealing were not the only hitch that Coinbase experienced when it finally added support for the new asset. Trade of Bitcoin Cash was frozen just four minutes after it began on the firm's Global Digital Asset Exchange (Gdax) and existing orders were cancelled. The move seems to have been a reaction to an apparent price surge in Bitcoin Cash on the platform beyond its already elevated level elsewhere. When Coinbase launched Bitcoin Cash at 17:20 PST (01:20 BST) it was valued at about $3,500 (£2,612) per coin. At the time it suspended it, the company was quoting a price of about $8,500. It remains unclear whether or not this was a software glitch or if deals were really being made at this level. Coinbase has yet to give a full explanation but has said that it intends to reopen Bitcoin Cash order books later on Wednesday. Bitcoin Cash is currently the world's third biggest crypto-currency with a total market capitalisation of about $59bn, according to Coinmarketcap. That compares with there being $77bn worth of Ethereum and $282bn worth of the original Bitcoin.",0.034128571428571425,0.09357112794612794

Social media users were alerted to the hack by a stream of unusual activity, including anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric. One post also claimed PM and party leader, Stefan Lofven, would resign. It is unclear who was responsible for hijacking the account but the police have been informed. Early on Monday morning social media users noticed a string of odd tweets sent from the Social Democratic Party's Twitter account. More than 20 tweets on a range of topics were shared before the party regained control of the account. The tweets were subsequently deleted from the account's timeline. ""We contacted the police immediately and are working with Twitter,"" a party spokesperson told the BBC. ""Attacks on political parties are attacks on free speech and democracy. We do everything we can to prevent these kind of intrusions."" The hijacked account made a number of false assertions and touched on far-right issues. It also claimed the Swedish prime minister, party leader Stefan Lofven, would resign, that cannabis had been legalised and that Sweden's official currency had been replaced with Bitcoin. The account shared a screenshot of a direct message it claimed to have sent to Social Security Minister Annika Strandhall. Interspersed with the claims was anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric. ""One like equals one dead Muslim,"" read one tweet sent from the account. ""Celebrate that we have reached a record number of rape victims with raising taxes and opening up the borders. Socialism for the win,"" another post read. Another expressed support for the anti-immigration politician, Hanif Bali. It's unclear who hijacked the account or why. ""I do not want to speculate on what or who is behind the attack,"" a spokesperson for the party told the BBC. But the hack targeted a centre-left political party and used its platform to make threats against Muslims, criticise immigration and joke about firing a prominent feminist. It's entirely possible it's the product of trolling, but if so this is trolls reflecting far right views. Since 2015, when more than 163,000 people submitted asylum applications at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, the Scandinavian country has become a regular fixture in international far-right discussions. The nationalist Sweden Democrats have become a more pronounced electoral force, capitalising on widespread insecurity about immigration.

The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO).

Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity. Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity. ""This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up,"" commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge. ""When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market."" Kodak developed a digital camera in 1975, but decided not to commercialise the technology at the time, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage is thought by some to have contributed to it filing for bankruptcy protection years later in 2012. Since that collapse, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras. The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights. More from CES: Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions. Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business. Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock.  But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday.  The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home. At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (£2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC. But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added. ""At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand,"" he said. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity. But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered. ""Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble,"" he said. ""It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive."" Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to. Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission.  The company said it would then ""manage the licensing process,"" so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin. ""Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists,"" said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke. ""These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that."" The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher. But one expert had doubts. ""Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does,"" commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that. ""This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't."" Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO. ""I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services,"" commented Mr Hileman.

74,Bitcoin: Does it really use more electricity than Ireland?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42265728,2017-12-12 00:25:02+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Can something which has no physical presence consume as much electricity as an entire country? The internet has recently been awash with claims that the digital currency Bitcoin could be using more electricity than a number of developed nations. So Reality Check wants to know: how did they work it out, and is it true?  Although it has been around since 2009, the digital currency, or crypto-currency, has been dominating headlines across the globe recently thanks to its soaring value. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks and largely exists online. Around 3,600 new bitcoins are created every day through a complex process known as ""mining"", where computers are rewarded with a bitcoin for processing mathematical equations through specialised software. Except this isn't only a handful of computers processing these equations, but thousands of machines all over the world running day and night - that's a lot of electricity. And as bitcoins increase in value, more and more machines are being plugged in and switched on by amateurs and professionals alike to mine them. Given their digital nature, there's understandably been a growing curiosity about how much electricity is actually being used to produce bitcoins. Social media platforms such as Twitter are unsurprisingly full of claims about Bitcoin's energy consumption. So are comparisons like this accurate? The short answer is that it's very difficult to say, as there are no recognised authoritative sources on energy usage for digital currencies like Bitcoin. Its peer-to-peer nature makes it very difficult to get an overview of anything other than the value of the digital currency itself. But people have tried. A widely-used formula to calculate energy consumption is from the crypto-currency blog Digiconomist, which relies on the performance specifications of common mining technology.  It takes total mining revenues as a starting point, estimates the operational costs to miners as a percentage of their revenues, and then converts these costs into energy consumption based on average electricity prices. According to this method, Bitcoin's current annual electricity consumption is estimated to be 32.56 terawatt hours (TWh). This is how comparisons with entire countries are being made. For example, data from Eurostat shows that in 2015, Denmark consumed 30.7 TWh of electricity and the Republic of Ireland consumed 25.07 TWh. So if we are to use this measure, then yes, you could argue that the comparisons on Twitter are broadly correct. But as this method uses assumptions and estimations, something that Digiconomist readily admits, it should come as no surprise that it is not without its critics. One analyst, Marc Bevand, argues this method is wrong because it does not take into account newer and more energy-efficient technology employed by miners, adding it makes ""the wrong assumption that a fixed '60%' of mining revenues are spent on electricity"".  When American business magazine Forbes reported at the end of October that Bitcoin's estimated market capitalisation value - the overall worth of a tradable entity - had surpassed those of household names such as Goldman Sachs and eBay, it was inevitable that the crypto-currency would soon become subject to comparisons with entire countries. But regardless of how you choose to measure the energy consumption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, there remains at least one area for consensus. As with any product - digital or physical - its future will ultimately be determined by how cost-effective it is to produce. The total number of bitcoins in circulation currently stands at 16.7 million, which will continue to rise until it reaches 21 million - the total supply set by the currency's rules. So long as electricity remains cheap and reliable, the technology readily available, and the value of the digital currency high enough to easily absorb production costs, Bitcoin is likely to continue to generate headlines until it reaches its maximum circulation.

75,Bitcoin futures trading begins on CBOE exchange in Chicago,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42304657,2017-12-11 11:39:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin has begun trading on a major exchange for the first time.  The digital currency launched on the CBOE futures exchange in Chicago at 23:00 GMT Sunday, allowing investors to bet on whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall.  Its value had surged in the run-up to its futures debut, which saw it rise another 17% to above $18,000. Bitcoin's introduction to the CBOE has been seen by some as a step towards legitimising the currency. The move is expected to be followed next week by a listing on the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CBOE trading saw the Bitcoin futures contract expiring in January start at $15,000 before rising to above $18,000. The contract is based on the price of Bitcoin as quoted on the Gemini exchange. The Gemini exchange was set up by the Winklevoss twins, who were early fans of the crypto-currency and who have been called the first Bitcoin billionaires. A CBOE insider said its start was low key, with ""no champagne"". However, CBOE tweeted to warn that its website was running slowly and could be temporarily unavailable. Anticipation of the first mainstream listings have helped the controversial currency soar past $10,000 and then over $17,000 on Thursday before retreating. The price of Bitcoin stood at about $16,600 on Monday, according to Coindesk.com. Futures are contracts that allow investors to bet on the price of something at a future date.  Investors can now bet on Bitcoin rising or falling in price without actually owning them. Futures are typically based on the price of a real commodity - such as oil. One of the controversial aspects of Bitcoin is that some do not see it as a ""thing"". Although it is called a currency, it can be argued it is an asset, or commodity, without any actual use or real assessable value.  Nick Colas, of Data Trek research, said the futures listings gave Bitcoin ""legitimacy - it recognises that it's an asset you can trade"". Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St James's Place told the BBC's Today programme that he remained cautious about the currency. ""I refuse to use the word legitimate, but it's probably moved out of the shadows into the open,"" he said. ""But what I think it means is more people in the conventional investment banking market will take a look at Bitcoin. ""It has been described as the asset class of 2017 but when we went into the year no one would have called it an asset class."" Bitcoin futures will make it easier for more investors to buy the crypto-currency, by removing the need for them to set up a special digital Bitcoin wallet. Sceptics argue that the CBOE futures will simply draw more naïve investors into perpetuating a bubble in a financial asset that Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz has accused of having no intrinsic value beyond supporting money laundering and tax avoidance. And there is something else that anyone placing big bets on the futures market may want to think about. The eventual payout on their futures contract depends on the auction price at the separate Gemini exchange of the Winklevoss brothers. Are they confident that the auction price cannot be manipulated, in the same way that Libor and regular currency derivatives have been in the recent past? The CBOE and CME launches were made possible following approval by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the regulator has warned investors about the ""potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts"".  The Futures Industry Association, which includes some of the world's biggest derivatives brokerages, has criticised the CFTC's decision, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the risks involved. Bitcoin is not regulated by any country's central bank and has no universally recognised exchange rate. CBOE rules suspend trading if Bitcoin prices rise or fall by 10%, in an attempt to reduce wild fluctuations. They kicked in twice in this first session. ""We are committed to continue to work closely with the CFTC to monitor trading and foster the growth of a transparent, liquid and fair Bitcoin futures market,"" CBOE said.",0.016962500000000002,0.0850998263888889
76,US man could face death penalty over Thailand 'sea home',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47974234,2019-04-18 09:44:41+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A US man and his partner could face the death penalty after they were accused of building a ""sea home"" off Thailand. Chad Elwartowski has gone into hiding with his girlfriend, Supranee Thepdet, after the navy said they had threatened the country's sovereignty. Their home, which sits atop a 20m (65ft) platform, is located around 12 miles (19km) off the coast of Phuket. But Mr Elwartowski insists it is 13 miles from the shore and therefore outside of Thailand's jurisdiction. ""The navy and its team... found a concrete tank floating on the sea but there was no-one on it,"" police colonel Nikorn Somsuk told AFP news agency. He added that the navy would meet local officials ""to consider what to do next"". The navy said the couple had failed to seek permission from Thailand before constructing the home. If the couple are found guilty of violating Thailand's sovereignty they could face life in prison and even the death penalty. Mr Elwartowski reportedly worked as a software engineer for the US military before becoming an investor in the virtual currency Bitcoin. The couple belong to the so-called ""seasteading"" movement, which promotes the construction of homes in international waters so that they are not subject to any country's laws. They are also part of Ocean Builders, a group of entrepreneurs who work to fund such homes. In a video posted in February, Mr Elwartowski said the community was a place where ""freedom-loving people can all gather together and actually be free"". The disputed structure was built that month, but was only discovered by the authorities this week. A statement published on the Ocean Builders website says the couple did not build the home themselves and were in fact just tenants. ""They spent a few weeks on the seastead and documented their adventure,"" it said. ""They were in no way involved in the design."" Mr Elwartowski told AFP that the couple were now hiding ""in a fairly safe place"". The number of homes built in international waters is unclear, but there are several examples of so-called micronations that have been constructed for similar reasons. Micronations are self-declared states not recognised by governments - one of the most famous, Sealand, is based on an offshore platform in the North Sea. It boasts its own flag, currency and even a football team. Several unofficial and unrecognised micronations have also emerged in Australia.  These include Hutt River Province, a private estate 500km north of Perth, which announced it was seceding in 1970 in a row over wheat quotas. It also has its own flag and currency - the Hutt River Dollar. And the micronation of Akhzivland in the north of Israel had a population of just two for nearly half a century. That was until its founder and president, Eli Avivi, died last year aged 88.",-0.12168400000000001,0.064
77,Bitcoin Foundation boss urges cautious investment,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41080478,2017-08-29 13:51:45+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc," The head of the Bitcoin Foundation, Llew Claasen, has urged people to invest ""no more than they can afford"" in the crypto-currency. He was speaking at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania about the potential for Bitcoin in Africa. Billions lack access to formal banking, but the uptake of mobile money means many are willing to embrace alternatives. Bitcoin had been adopted in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, he said. The digital currency had particular resonance in countries with volatile economies, he said. ""It offers people a chance to protect their savings from government abuse of monetary policy. ""A lot of people in Zimbabwe are interested in it as an alternative financial system, but that is not an easy thing to do formally as we don't want to be perceived as wanting to disrupt economies,"" he told the BBC. The Washington-based Bitcoin Foundation is a non-profit organisation that promotes the use of Bitcoin around the world. Like other crypto-currencies, it relies on a digital technology called the blockchain - a decentralised digital ledger that records every transaction. The tokenisation of crypto-currency - in which the rights to an asset are converted into a digital token on a blockchain - could also have a big impact on Africa, Mr Claasen said. ""It means a small business owner can tokenise shares in his business so investors do not have to go through a central intermediary or register their shares."" That would make it easier for investors to both put money in and take it out of businesses, he added. Mr Claasen admitted that, in its current form, Bitcoin was not great as an alternative to cash. But, he said, a forthcoming network upgrade would make low-cost transactions on the mobile network easier. ""Currently the network has a transactional input of three to four transactions per second, which isn't great if you want to use it as cash.  ""But once the upgrade goes live, effectively there will be no limit to the transactions the network can handle."" That upgrade is due in the next six to 12 months. Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high, with the value of one bitcoin soaring to about $4,500 (£3,470). But Mr Claasen sounded a note of caution, urging people not to invest ""more than they can afford"". ""To be honest Bitcoin is not a great form of cash right now. Don't think of it as cash, think of it as a digital form of gold that enables you to save outside of the current financial climate,"" he said. He blamed the currency's recent volatility of the currency on ""unsophisticated investors"". ""They read an article about it which may or may not be true and make decisions about its long-term future, and that is why we have extreme swings,"" he said. But in a decade's time, he said, everyone would have ""two wallets"", one reflecting local currency and one with a variety of crypto-currencies. He dismissed worries that the currency, because of its anonymous nature, could be used for tax evasion and money-laundering. He pointed to a European Union report this summer that suggested that its potential for criminal activity had been overblown. ""It found that there was not a lot of large-scale criminal behaviour,"" he said. ""Bitcoin is not completely anonymous and it is fairly easy for someone, say a revenue officer, to work backwards to find who was responsible for a transaction.""",-0.004242307692307669,0.04103722666222666
78,Crypto-currencies gaining popularity in Kenya,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47307575,2019-02-22 15:41:40+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Interest in virtual currencies is rising across the African continent, especially in Kenya, Africa's Silicon Valley. Despite warnings from Kenya's central bank about the volatility of crypto-currencies, some businesses in Nairobi are now accepting Bitcoin payments. The total number of Bitcoin transactions in Kenya are estimated to be worth over $1.5m, according to the Blockchain Association of Kenya. But can the technology really take off? Crypto-currencies are virtual money that can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on a technology called blockchain - a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. The information is stored chronologically and is designed to be de-centralised and tamper-proof. While this provides security, it also means there is no oversight from a central authority such as a bank or a government. The first-ever blockchain-backed currency developed was Bitcoin, and it continues to be the most widely-used globally. At the moment, the crypto-currencies Bitcoin, Dash and Lisk are used in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Blockchain is also being implemented by start-ups and tech conglomerates alike in Kenya to help solve problems, such as IBM's platform to help small businesses to prove their creditworthiness for loans.  Tony Mwongera, the chief executive of Healthland Spa in Nairobi, began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018. ''I decided to adopt the use of crypto-currencies because there was so much theft in my business,"" he told the BBC. ""So I said, let me use a way that can be safe, secure and I can also embrace technology."" Healthland Spa customers told the BBC that they like the convenience of using crypto-currencies to pay for purchases.  However, if you look at the total number of people in Kenya using virtual currencies today, it is still relatively small - only about 40,000 people have ever made a transaction using Bitcoin. Part of the reason crypto-currency penetration isn't growing that much is because Kenya's central bank has forbidden banks from dealing in virtual currencies. Banks are not allowed to open accounts for people who are known to dealing in any virtual currency, which means that the population cannot easily convert Bitcoin payments into cash or mobile money. ""Crypto-currencies can facilitate and ensure that you do an unlimited number of transactions, however the volatility, lack of control and the non-acceptability of crypto-currencies across different jurisdictions impairs what you'd expect a currency to do,"" economist and policy expert Vincent Kimosop told the BBC.  The Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is actively working to educate the country on the benefits of using crypto-currencies and blockchain.  The non-profit body says that using virtual currencies can greatly reduce the cost of transactions, and enable people without bank accounts to quickly make and receive payments. According to BAK, there are many things Kenyans have realised they can use Bitcoin for - whether it is to pay merchants in China for goods, or to enable Nigerians to pay to send their children to school in Kenya, or to enable young African freelancers to be easily paid for their work online.

In one month, anti-malware software company Malwarebytes said it stopped almost 250 million attempts to place coin-mining malware on to PCs.  Symantec said it had seen a ""tenfold"" increase in the amount of malicious code connected with crypto-cash. Cyber-thieves are using both dedicated software, hacked websites and emails to snare victims. ""There's been a huge spike,"" said Candid Wuest, a threat researcher at online security firm Symantec, adding that it had been caused by the rapid increase in Bitcoin's value. On 29 November, the value of one Bitcoin surpassed $10,000 (£7,943) - a massive increase on the $1,000 each one was worth at the start of 2017, although that figure has now fallen back sharply. ""With $10,000 being breached, and all the hype, a lot of people are trying to make money with crypto-coins,"" said Mr Wuest.  Most of the activity seen by Symantec and other security firms involves crypto-coins other than Bitcoin. This was because it took a huge amount of computer power to produce or ""mine"" bitcoins. By contrast, he said, mining other crypto-coins such as Monero could be done on desktops, laptops and even smartphones.  Many of these alternative coins had risen in value alongside Bitcoin, said Mr Wuest. Mining involves solving complicated mathematical problems and those who take part can be rewarded with coins. The more machines one person can get mining on their behalf - the more coins they are likely to amass, said Mr Wuest. Malwarebytes told the BBC that its security software was now, on average, stopping about eight million attempts a day by coin-mining code to compromise users' PCs.  Much of this coin-mining software was found on websites that had been hacked, to give attackers the ability to install their own code. One researcher found almost 2,500 sites hosting mining code.  Other cyber-thieves have hijacked extensions and add-ons for web browsing programs to insert the malicious code. Once on a computer, the malware often runs processors at close to 100% to get as much mining work done as possible. On smartphones, this can mean batteries are depleted very quickly. Much of the mining malware seen before now relied on using a victim's browser, said Malwarebytes' security researcher Jerome Segura. Attackers had now adapted malware to ensure it mines coins for as long as possible and did not stop when a browsing program was shut down. ""The trick is that although the visible browser windows are closed, there is a hidden one that remains opened,"" wrote Mr Segura in a blog detailing how the malware works. The tiny window lurks beneath the taskbar on a Windows machine and would not be noticed by a victim, he said. Adverts that run on porn sites had been found harbouring this malware, he added. It is not only websites that are being caught up in attempts to cash in on the crypto-cash boom, said Nicole Eagan, chief executive of security firm Darktrace. Ms Eagan said it had found coin-mining programs of one sort or another on the internal networks of 25% of its customers. Many sought to use the significant computer processing power available inside corporate networks to generate coins.  ""Sometimes it's an external intrusion into the network and sometimes its an employee that's looking to do it,"" she said. ""It's rampant at the moment,"" ",0.10314137931034484,0.0704102809706258

This year, electricity use at Bitcoin mining data centres is likely to exceed that of all Iceland's homes, according to Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson. He said many potential customers were keen to get in on the act. ""If all these projects are realised, we won't have enough energy for it,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sigurbergsson's calculations were first reported by the Associated Press. Iceland has a small population, of around 340,000 people. But in recent years it has seen a marked increase in the number of new data centres, often built by firms wishing to tout green credentials. Nearly 100% of energy in Iceland comes from renewable sources. Bitcoin mining refers to the work done by computers connected to the global Bitcoin network.  These computers solve complex mathematical problems - a process that in turn validates transactions between users of the crypto-currency. The computers that do this validation work receive small Bitcoin rewards for their trouble, making it a lucrative exercise, especially when done at a large scale. ""What we're seeing now is... you can almost call it exponential growth, I think, in the [energy] consumption of data centres,"" said Mr Sigurbergsson. He added that he expects Bitcoin mining operations will use around 840 gigawatt hours of electricity to supply data centre computers and cooling systems, for example. He estimated that the county's homes, in contrast, use around 700 gigawatt hours every year. ""I don't see it stopping quite yet,"" added Mr Sigurbergsson, referring to data centre projects.  ""I'm getting a lot of calls, visits from potential investors or companies wanting to build data centres in Iceland."" He also said that there are so many proposed data centres that it wouldn't be possible to supply all of them.  He added that his firm was mostly interested in dealing with companies that were willing to commit to long-term contracts of a few years or more. If Iceland took on all of the proposed Bitcoin mining ventures, there simply wouldn't be enough electricity to supply them all, he added. The crypto-currency mining industry in Iceland was recently given a boost thanks to the launch of The Moonlite Project - a large data centre where various crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, will be mined. It is set to open later this year and will have an initial capacity of 15 megawatts, though this is expected to increase in the future. Some have questioned how beneficial the rise of the crypto-currency mining will be to Iceland. Smari McCarthy, a member of the Icelandic parliament for the Pirate Party, tweeted: ""Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no staff, very little in capital investments, and mostly leaves no taxes either.  ""The value to Iceland... is virtually zero."" He also clarified previous reports that quoted him as saying he was keen to tax Bitcoin mining firms. It has previously been reported that the electricity demand of the world's total combined Bitcoin mining operations may now exceed the energy use of the Republic of Ireland, though this calculation may not be entirely accurate.  But as crypto-currencies rise in popularity, mining operations certainly continue to use more and more resources - recent analysis of European energy use in 2017 by campaign group Sandbag noted that Bitcoin mining was contributing to additional power demand in the technology sector.

BTCC said it would stop buying and selling on 30 September in response to tightening regulation. It comes after authorities banned initial coin offerings on 5 September.  The country has seen an explosion of digital currency trading, sparking fears about the financial risks and speculative investing.  The price of Bitcoin tumbled sharply following the BTCC announcement late on Thursday but has since regained some ground.  Chinese authorities expressed concern over the investment risks involved in crypto-currencies and ordered a ban on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, earlier this month.  A growing number of tech companies are opting to sell digital ""tokens"" to raise funds because they are quick, easy and unregulated.  Then on Wednesday this week, the state-backed National Internet Finance Association issued a warning that virtual currencies are increasingly being used as a tool for illegal fundraising and money laundering.  BTCC, one of the world's biggest Bitcoin platforms, said in a tweet Thursday after ""carefully considering"" the directive from regulators, trading on its platform would cease and it would stop registering new users from Thursday. BTCC also runs an international exchange from Hong Kong. More intervention is expected. The BTCC shutdown comes ahead of speculation that the Chinese government plans to completely ban exchanges.  Reuters and other media have reported this week, citing sources, that China is planning the suspension, but the regulator has not yet made any such announcement. China's ICO ban, and wider fears of more regulation, has prompted a sell-off that has wiped billions of the value of crypto-currencies since they hit record highs at the start of the month.  Regulators around the world are in the midst of working out how to address some of the risks around virtual currencies.   The UK's financial watchdog warned this week that ICOs are ""very high-risk, speculative investments,"" while the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that some ICOs should be regulated like other stocks. Regulators in Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada have also pointed out some of the dangers. Digital currencies are also facing scrutiny from the private sector. This week JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon branded Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and said it was set to ""blow up"".

The market value of all bitcoins in existence has now surpassed $56bn (£43bn). The surge followed the creation of a spin-off crypto-currency, Bitcoin Cash, last week. The new asset is trading well below the peak price of $727.54 (£557) per coin it attained on 2 August.

The market value of all bitcoins in existence has now surpassed $56bn (£43bn). The surge followed the creation of a spin-off crypto-currency, Bitcoin Cash, last week.

84,Bitcoin rebels risk 'currency trading chaos',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40779767,2017-07-31 16:54:05+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A split in the Bitcoin community is set to create a new incompatible version of the cryptocurrency on Tuesday. A group of insiders is unhappy with existing plans to speed up transaction times. They plan to offer existing investors a matching amount of a new virtual asset - called Bitcoin Cash - which could put pressure on the value of original bitcoins. One expert has warned there could be trading ""chaos"" over the coming days. Several popular Bitcoin platforms are refusing to support the new coins. That means investors who currently rely on some Bitcoin currency exchanges and virtual wallets will be unable to take advantage of the offer unless they switch to alternative providers. And moving from one platform to another carries risks of its own. ""Nobody can be sure how this is going to play out over the short term,"" commented Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director of the eToro trading platform. The breakaway plan was revealed just over a week ago after it emerged that a compromise scheme to reform Bitcoin appeared to have gathered enough support to be adopted. The middle-ground solution - known as Segwit2x - is an attempt to address one of Bitcoin's constraints: at present the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only one megabyte of data added to it every 10 minutes. The limitation was originally introduce to protect Bitcoin from cyber-attacks, but has meant some users have had to wait days for their transactions to complete at busy times. Two conflicting solutions were initially proposed: Many ""miners"" - dedicated businesses and others that contribute computer processing power to authorise transactions in return for the chance of being awarded newly minted Bitcoins - favoured the former plan. But many developers - those working on Bitcoin's code or that of associated software - preferred the latter. The Segwit2x initiative solved the impasse by suggesting the data-splitting step should occur in August and then be followed by an increase in the block size to 2MB in November. Under the terms of a related scheme - referred to as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) - the first step would only happen if 80% of the mining effort adopted the new blockchain software required and used it consistently between 21 July and 31 July. After more than 95% of miners signalled their support for the plan it was widely assumed that a Bitcoin ""civil war"" had been averted. But then ex-Facebook engineer Amaury Sechet and other Bitcoin insiders revealed plans to launch Bitcoin Cash on 1 August at  12:20 UTC (13:20 BST). They claimed that the danger with the Segwit2x scheme was that there was no guarantee a doubling of the block size would follow the data-splitting step, as promised. Instead their new currency would have a block size of 8MB and ditch the data-dividing idea. To further complicate matters, some Bitcoin exchanges are divided about whether to support the creation of Bitcoin Cash and allow its trade, with several yet to declare their plans. Furthermore, some exchanges plan to suspend or restrict trade in Bitcoin altogether for several days until they are confident that any disruption has passed. The uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin Cash's chances has led to one futures market in Bitcoin Cash to value one coin as being worth about $267, a fraction of the $2,780 each bitcoin was trading at short time ago.  In theory, if mass adoption were expected, the two currencies should be much closer in price. ""There's massive uncertainty and the quoted futures price should be taken with a grain of salt,"" commented Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""We won't know the real Bitcoin Cash price until a number of exchanges across the world start trading it, and it's still not clear when that will happen."" And he added that there could be some wild swings in the value of both types of Bitcoin over the coming days. ""My sense is that the split can be managed if exchanges and wallets take the necessary precautions,"" he explained. ""But I suspect some will not be well prepared as this happened quickly and a lot of organisations are coming on board at the last minute.

The virtual currency peaked at $5,103.91 in the early hours of Saturday, according to CoinDesk's price index. The record high helped push the total value of publicly traded crypto-currencies - including Ethereum and the Bitcoin-offshoot Bitcoin Cash - to more than $176bn. However, there has since been a sell-off. At time of writing, Bitcoin was 12% off its peak, at $4,485. At the start of the year, one bitcoin traded for less than $1,000, and as recently as July some market watchers feared that the currency could crash lower as a result of a mooted ""civil war"" over its future. However, since then, its value has been boosted, after most of its developers and miners - those who authorise transactions by contributing computing power - began implementing a compromise plan to let the technology handle more transactions per minute. In addition, August's ""fork"" of the underlying blockchain - the ledger of past Bitcoin transfers - created the new virtual currency Bitcoin Cash without causing major disruption to the original asset. Both events attracted media attention, which has been linked to Bitcoin's subsequent climb. Despite the current fallback, one expert said he expected Bitcoin to continue to rise over the medium term. ""We've seen drops like this happen before when a particular number is hit - often because people have placed orders with exchanges to exit a currency when it reaches a certain value,"" said Eitan Jankelewitz, a specialist in crypto-currencies at the London-based law firm Sheridans. ""And it's human nature to pick a round number [like $5,000]. ""But traditional investors are starting to view having crypto-currency as a small part of their diversified portfolios as an acceptable way to add risk.

86,Bitcoin swings as civil war looms,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40654194,2017-07-20 10:38:15+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The value of the virtual currency Bitcoin has always been volatile. Even so, there has been particular turbulence in recent days as fears of a ""civil war"" among its adherents first grew and then subsided, although they have not gone away altogether. On Sunday, the value of one bitcoin dropped to about $1,863 (£1,430) before bouncing back to $2,402 on Wednesday, according to data from the news site CoinDesk - still some way off a June high of $3,019. Bitcoin risks becoming a victim of its success. The popularity of the financial technology has caused transactions to be processed slower, with some users complaining of having to wait three days or more for confirmation of trades when the backlog was at its worst, in May. Moreover, fees have also risen, hitting a high of $5 per transaction at the start of June.  That makes it too costly to justify its use for some purchases, such as buying a pint of lager in a Bitcoin-accepting pub. There are ways around the problem, but the cryptocurrency's community has been split over which solution to adopt. The risk is that Bitcoin could effectively split in two, with one type becoming incompatible with another, ultimately undermining confidence in the project altogether. The issue is that Bitcoin's underlying technology has an in-built constraint: the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only 1MB of data added to it every 10 minutes. To understand why, it's helpful to first understand how Bitcoin works. To authenticate Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" takes place, which involves volunteers' computers racing to solve difficult mathematical problems. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. As a reward, the successful miners are given newly generated bitcoins. An updated copy of the blockchain database is then copied to all the computers involved in the validation process, which are referred to as ""nodes"". Bitcoin originally did not have the 1MB/10min blockchain limit, but the feature was added to help defend the technology against denial of service (DoS) attacks, which might overwhelm the blockchain by flooding it with tiny transactions. Mining, by the way, has become a big business in its own right, with some companies investing in huge ""farms"" of computers dedicated to the activity. Several of the biggest are based in China. Many of the miners have, in fact, favoured the so-called Bitcoin Unlimited solution. They said that allowing them to increase the 1MB block size would speed up transactions and reduce transactions fees. But this could also make mining more expensive, and impractical for small ""mom and pop"" operations, leaving it under the control of a handful of large corporations. That is because more processing power would be needed to verify transactions. Furthermore, additional data bandwidth and storage space would be needed to transmit and store the blockchain, since it would become much bigger. Critics also say the move would make Bitcoin more vulnerable to hackers. Moreover, some people are concerned that giving the miners power to vary the block size might undermine the principle of Bitcoin being decentralised, with no equivalent to a central bank running the show. Some software developers have favoured reorganising the format of Bitcoin transactions to make the blockchain more efficient. Specifically, they propose relocating "" transaction signatures"" - which unlock bitcoins so they can be spent - from within the blockchain to a separate file transmitted alongside it. Doing so should make it possible to process transactions at double the current rate. And as an added benefit, ""node"" computers could save on storage space by opting not to keep records of the oldest signatures. This scheme is known as Segregated Witness, or Segwit. However, critics say it would deliver only a temporary respite while adding an extra level of complexity. It appears so. A middle-ground solution - called Segwit2x - aims to start sending signature data separately from the blockchain later this week and then to double the block size limit to 2MB in three months' time. An initiative called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) states that if 80% of the mining effort adopts the new blockchain software involved and uses it consistently between 21 July and 31 July, then the wider community should accept this as the solution. The good news for those who like the idea is that close to 90% of miners appear to back the effort, according to Coin Dance, a Bitcoin-related statistics site. Other plans exist to try again after August if the target is missed. But a risk remains that if use of Segwit2x software never reaches the required threshold or that hardcore opponents refuse to buckle, then it could result in two different versions of the blockchain, and in effect two types of Bitcoin. Such as schism could help rival cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, prosper and ultimately doom Bitcoin altogether. One expert, however, said he believed that was an unlikely outcome. ""The vast majority of people in the Bitcoin community are opposed to splitting Bitcoin into two competing cryptocurrencies,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""Such a move would weaken Bitcoin's network effect advantage and sow confusion. ""It is much more likely that people who are dissatisfied with Bitcoin's direction will simply move on to something else, which is what we've seen in the past.""  ""More and more small to medium sized companies who are 'mining' at the moment will be taken out of the game if they won't adapt and grow,"" said Martin Sims, CEO of Coin Geek. ""It's a very competitive industry and everyone needs to update and evolve as the popularity of bitcoin increases and the game changes.""",0.034906976744186045,0.06740897345548508

On Tuesday, it shot past $2,200 (£1,700), more than doubling from just two months ago. And a newer currency, Ethereum, has climbed even faster. Industry members say uncertainty surrounding the value of global currencies, including the pound, is driving demand for alternative currencies.  The kind of technology that underwrites Bitcoin and newer entrants such as Ethereum, is also gaining, well, currency, as it gets put to new uses by developers and others looking to beef up cyber-security. Policy changes in Japan and elsewhere in Asia have made it easier to trade. And of course, when it comes to price, interest generates its own momentum. ""It's a promising technology,"" says Joshua Rosenblatt, 34, a Nashville-based attorney at Frost Brown Todd, a midwestern law firm with offices in eight states. He is both an investor and works in the field. ""The returns have been unreal and there's an aspect of not wanting to miss out on a bubble."" Bitcoin's market capitalisation shot past $30bn this month, as the price climbed. Ethereum remains smaller at about $15bn, but it is growing too. The price spiked from less than $20 in March to about $170 today, according to CoinDesk, which tracks the two currencies. Activity is also up. The number of daily trades in Bitcoin, which is more established, has rocketed from around 40,000 at the start of 2013 to more than 330,000 today. About 2,700 participants attended an industry conference in New York this week, according to Michael Crosby, head of strategy for CoinDesk, which hosted the event.  Mr Rosenblatt, one of the people in attendance, works with smaller investment firms and start-ups, navigating issues relating to coin offerings and ""smart contracts"", which use similar technology to enforce and verify business transactions.  In the last year, the number of clients looking for that work has increased from one to about two dozen, he says.  ""Our firm is kind of a middle America firm, so the fact that we're seeing that sort of interest speaks to how much the industry has grown,"" he says. Grayscale launched its first digital currency investment trust in 2013. The New York firm now manages about $400m of investments in digital currencies, up from $60m at the end of 2015, as its client base of wealthy investors, hedge funds and other small firms has grown, and prices for Ethereum and Bitcoin have climbed. ""We've seen just an absolute explosion,"" says Matthew Beck, an associate at the firm.  Bitcoin: Is the crypto-currency doomed? 'I bought Bitcoins in 2011 - now they're worth £19,000' Bitcoin value tops gold for first time Mr Beck says the firm expects to continue to attract interest, as investors use digital assets to diversify. ""We're seeing investors start to diversify... and carve out an allocation for digital assets,"" he says. At the moment Bitcoin is used for cross-border transfers, payments for online activities such as gaming and gambling - and as an investment, says Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, one of the major trading platforms. The currency also made headlines as the preferred currency of the hackers behind the recent attack that crippled the National Health Service in the UK and other organisations around the world. Industry members say some companies may be buying up Bitcoin to deploy in the event of a future attack, but they maintained that broader demand is driving price gains. ""There's a number of people from family offices [and] private equity firms - they're making small bets and when you add that type of liquidity to the market, that's going to drive the price up,"" says Mr Crosby. This year's Consensus conference drew some big corporate names, such as insurer State Farm, carmaker Toyota, and consulting firm Deloitte. Fidelity Investments, a staid, Boston-based money manager known for handling retirement accounts, was one of the presenters. It now accepts Bitcoin in its cafeteria and will soon launch a feature to allow clients to check on their digital currency holdings alongside other investments.   In the scheme of global finance, a $30bn market remains ""trivial"", says Blockchain's Peter Smith. But interest from those players is a sign the industry is becoming more accepted. ""It has truthfully gotten a lot more mainstream and that's a beautiful thing to see in many ways,"" he says. For 49-year-old Stuart Fraser, the climbing price has meant a tidy return on the roughly £15,000 worth of Bitcoin he bought in early 2014. He estimates his holdings have more than doubled, even after subtracting the Bitcoin he used to buy a virtual reality headset and make investments in the newer Ethereum. Investors say they are prepared for a boom-bust cycle as the market continues to evolve, technology changes, and regulations come into play. But Mr Fraser, the managing director of Scotland-based financial technology start-up Wallet.Services, who previously worked in cyber-security, says unless he sees a promising new competitor, he doesn't plan to cash in now.

Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Buying Bitcoin, he said, was similar to gambling - and had the same level of risk. ""It's not a currency, it's actually not regulated in its Bitcoin form,"" Mr Bailey told me in an interview for Newsnight. ""It's a very volatile commodity in terms of its pricing. ""If you look at what has happened this year, I would caution people. ""We know relatively little about what informs the price of Bitcoin. ""It's an odd commodity as well, as the supply is fixed. ""If you want to invest in Bitcoin be prepared to lose your money - that would be my serious warning."" Mr Bailey said that financial regulators did not oversee ""commodities"" and that he was not immediately pressing for a change in the rules. And he denied that regulators were being left behind by the new technology of cryptocurrencies.  ""The decision on what we regulate is appropriate for government and Parliament,"" he said. ""It would be for Parliament ultimately to make that choice if it wished to do so. ""I don't press for that providing people understand very clearly this is a very volatile commodity. ""[But] if parliament wants to go further we will happily provide the evidence we have and will support the decision they want to take."" The cryptocurrency has grabbed the headlines this year after its value soared. A year ago one Bitcoin was reported to be worth £580 on CoinDesk, a cryptocurrency news site. Today it is worth £12,400. Such a rapid rise in value has led to increased interest in the ""currency"", with retail investors buying Bitcoin online and via specially configured ATMs. The head of the central bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, described it as a ""speculative mania"" and many believe the present valuation is not sustainable. If the price falls rapidly then many investors could be left with big losses, particularly as it can take as long as 15 minutes to execute a sale - a long period in financial exchange terms during which the value of Bitcoin could fall dramatically. I asked Mr Bailey whether the use of the term ""currency"" was misleading. ""By adopting the name of cryptocurrency there is a risk that some people regard it as the same as what an economist would call a fiat currency,"" he said. ""A fiat currency is backed by the state and that's what preserves the value of the currency through the actions that central banks take. ""Bitcoin is not that - it's not a currency."" Bitcoin, which is created virtually, is anonymous, unregulated and has been used by criminals to launder money and demand ransoms. Its supply is also limited and its creators, believed to be a group of coding experts, have said that the number of Bitcoin will never rise above 21 million. At present there are around 16 million. This week, the price of Bitcoin rose again as the first officially regulated financial exchanges in America started to allow investors to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin. Such futures trading is regulated across the world. ""If you buy a future or if you buy an option then we do come into the picture,"" Mr Bailey said. He admitted that it was unclear who was buying Bitcoin as the system was anonymous. ""You can't go somewhere and look up the record of who owns Bitcoin,"" he said. ""If I thought there was evidence of people saying 'you know what? I'm going to put my pension into Bitcoin' - I would be very concerned but we don't see that at the moment.""",0.009590322580645167,0.0669655076106689
91,Bitcoin splits as new currency takes off,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40800270,2017-08-02 09:14:48+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A new version of Bitcoin has been mined for the first time in the crypto-currency's history. Bitcoin Cash is the result of months of debate and development over how the currency would continue to evolve. Fears of large swings in the value of Bitcoin have so far not been realised - but some exchanges are still adapting to the new currency. One expert said the process had gone smoothly so far and pointed out that trade in Bitcoin Cash seemed ""robust"". Bitcoin Cash was developed as a measure to increase the capacity of Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain - a digital ledger that records every single transaction. Because the old blockchain could only have one megabyte (MB) of data added to it every 10 minutes, transactions have come to be processed at slower rates. Bitcoin Cash blocks can be as large as 8MB, which its proponents hope will help to solve this problem. Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash was officially born when block number 478559 - at just under 2MB in size - was mined. No major issues have so far been detected following the split although a few exchanges and wallets have had minor technical issues with supporting Bitcoin Cash initially, said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""A market seems to be emerging for Bitcoin Cash that looks to be relatively robust,"" he told the BBC. The fresh-faced crypto-currency was trading comfortably above $400 (£300) about 12 hours after it was created. Bitcoin itself saw a modest fall in price on Tuesday, but was still above $2,700 (£2,000) at 10:00 BST on Wednesday. Thanks to its larger block size, Bitcoin Cash requires more computer storage space from parties wishing to take part in the process of mining. Mining involves computers being tasked with solving difficult mathematical problems in order to authorise transactions on the blockchain. Miners receive new bitcoins as a reward for this work - making it lucrative - and it has also been something open to individuals in the past, because the cost of small scale mining equipment has been relatively low.  That could change thanks to Bitcoin Cash. ""Bigger players with access to server farms and big budgets will have no problem running bigger nodes, but smaller operators could be squeezed out,"" said Dr Hileman. ""Will companies dominate Bitcoin Cash more than Bitcoin? We're going to see this in the flesh now, how this will play out."" And there are other issues to ponder - not least the decision by one of the biggest crypto-currency exchanges, Coinbase, not to support Bitcoin Cash. ""Seriously look at Bitcoin Cash going up. If you kept your [Bitcoin] at @coinbase and are not getting any you must be pretty fed up right now,"" tweeted one trader who watched the split unfold.  The split might also make it harder to establish Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash as currencies useful for commerce, suggested Vili Lehdonvirta at the Oxford Internet Institute. This is because a greater number of currencies each with a smaller number of users are less likely to be accepted in lots of different places, he explained. But Bitcoin traders may simply be interested in speculation - buying and selling coins in the hope they rise in value.

Zoobia Shahnaz, 27, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering and is being held without bail. Ms Shahnaz was born in Pakistan and worked as a lab technician in the US. Prosecutors say she took out fraudulent loans of $85,000 (£63,000) in order to buy the bitcoin online. Bitcoin is an online currency. Despite not being legal tender, the value of bitcoin has rocketed this year. It has been exploited by criminals to launder money. British authorities are pushing to increase regulation of the currency. According to court records, Ms Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June.  Prosecutors said that Ms Shahnaz obtained a Pakistani passport in July and booked a flight to Pakistan with a layover in Istanbul, intending to travel to Syria.  She was arrested at John F Kennedy airport carrying $9,500 in cash, just under the limit of $10,000 that a person can legally take out of the country without declaring the funds. Searches of her electronic devices showed numerous searches for Islamic State-related material.  Ms Shahnaz faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the money laundering charges and up to 30 years for the bank fraud charge. Her lawyer, Steve Zissou, said she was sending money overseas to help Syrian refugees.

All Bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai have been ordered to submit plans for winding down their operations by 20 September. The move follows the Chinese central bank's decision to ban initial coin offerings in early September.  Top exchange BTCC said it would stop trading at the end of the month. Chinese authorities decided to ban digital currencies as part of a plan for reducing the country's financial risks. A website set up by the Chinese central bank warned that cryptocurrencies are ""increasingly used as a tool in criminal activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, smuggling, and illegal fundraising"". According to a document leaked online by users on the social network Weibo that was seen by Coindesk, Chinese regulators ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges in Beijing to stop registering new user registration by midnight local time on 15 September, and to notify users publicly when they formally close. All exchanges are required to send regulators a detailed ""risk-free"" plan of how they intend to exit the market before 18:30 local time on Wednesday 20 September. The regulator also ordered the exchanges to submit DVDs containing all user trading and holding data to the local authorities. Shareholders, controllers, executives, and core financial and technical staff of exchanges are also required to remain in Beijing during the shutdown and to co-operate fully with authorities.  ""China is shutting the exchanges down for good reasons - I think it's right they're being cautious at this time,"" Paul Armstrong, an emerging technology adviser and author of the book Disruptive Technologies, told the BBC.  ""Bitcoin is by proxy unregulated and peer-to-peer, it's a very volatile currency."" However, Mr Armstrong does not think that this will be the end of Bitcoin in China for good. ""They're shutting it down for now, but it doesn't mean that in six months or so they won't create new Bitcoin regulations like Japan and Australia did,"" he said. ""All the other countries have digital currencies and are making important decisions about it, so it doesn't make sense for China to dismiss it out of hand."" He added that China's decision could prompt Chinese investors to seek alternative options to digital currencies, such as moving out of the country and operating exchanges or Bitcoin mining pools in other regions.

The valuation caps a strong month for the virtual currency, with its value growing by more than 65% in a month. The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks. Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215).  And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690). Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where.  Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins.  Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies.  Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months.  The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing.

Marco Ciocca, co-founder and chairman of the Montessori Schools in Flatiron & Soho, added the option in June, after growing inquiries from parents. The decision comes as an increasing number of places - including universities in London and Greece -  take the digital currency as payment. About 10 parents of the roughly 300 students have opted to pay in Bitcoin so far, Mr Ciocca said.  He predicts that number will rise in coming years.  ""If we talk about just the sort of transactional ease... I think this form of payment will continue to grow,"" he said. Bitcoin is a digital currency that was first used in the real world in 2010. As acceptance has grown, so has its value. Bitcoin's worth has more than doubled since the start of the year and tops $2,500 (£1,900) today, according to CoinDesk, which tracks the currency. 'I bought Bitcoins in 2011 - now they're worth £19,000' It's not just Bitcoin anymore... Parents who invested early and have ridden the currency's rise get something like a discount on the school's hefty $31,000 tuition. But Mr Ciocca said the school won't profit from up-and-downs in the market. Tuition payments in Bitcoin - they also accept some other digital currencies - get converted to cash instantly. The decision to accept digital currencies matched the schools' identity as ""forward-thinking"" and appealed to a pool of families drawn from tech and finance worlds, Mr Ciocca said.  (Google and Facebook are among the firms with large offices not far from the schools.) Bitcoin is also an easier way to process money than other kinds of payments, such as credit cards, he said. ""It's just a much more seamless transaction,"" he said. Mr Ciocca, who has followed the currencies for some time as an investor, plans to be part of that growth.  He's working to offer the option to parents at two sister schools run by his family in Miami, Florida, in September. Angela Ciocca, Mr Ciocca's sister, is headmistress of the schools there.

Thomas White launched Silk Road 2.0 less than a month after the FBI closed the original site in 2013. In March, the 24-year-old admitted drug trafficking, money laundering and making 464 indecent images of children. On Friday, he was sentenced, at Liverpool Crown Court, to 64 months in jail.  The National Crime Agency (NCA) said White quit his accounting degree at Liverpool John Moores University after a single term. He was an administrator of the Silk Road 2.0 dark web site, which let users buy and sell drugs and computer hacking tools with a degree of anonymity. White's site specialised in supplying class A and B drugs as well as legal highs, when he ran it from November 2013 to March 2014. The NCA said White also hoarded child sex abuse images of the most extreme nature so that he could sell them. The Silk Road website took its name from the historic trade routes spanning Europe, Asia and parts of Africa. It achieved notoriety through media reports and online chatter. But users could only access the site through Tor, a system that obfuscates who is visiting a website and from which country. Tor was created by the US government to help provide activists with anonymity. It is now used for a variety of purposes - including masking illegal transactions. Illegal drugs such as heroin could be bought on the Silk Road using the crypto-currency Bitcoin, which can be difficult to trace. The website also offered hacking equipment and stolen passports for sale. Although he had no legitimate income, White paid £10,700 up front to rent a plush apartment on Liverpool's waterfront. He also spent £35,000 on computer equipment. Investigators are not sure how much money he made from his website. However, $96m (£73m) worth of goods were traded on Silk Road 2.0 and White took between 1% and 5% commission on each sale. In an online chat with an administrator of Silk Road 2.0, White said he wanted to set up a website for paedophiles ""because there is money to be made from these people"". A vast amount of encrypted data was discovered on his computers including copies of information stolen from the FBI, Nasa, the extra-marital affairs website Ashley Madison and UK internet service provider TalkTalk. White is not thought to have hacked the companies himself. Investigators also seized from White about 50 bitcoins, which have a current value of about £192,000. ""We believe he profited significantly from his crimes, which will now be subject to a proceeds of crime investigation,"" said Ian Glover from the NCA.",-0.14764583333333334,-0.036991567460317454

Homero Joshua Garza told investors he would use custom-built computers to mine the virtual currency on their behalf and share the proceeds. In reality, said the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Garza did not own enough computers to generate the funds he promised investors.  The decision comes as the value of individual bitcoins hits $2,800. In its summary of the case, the SEC said Garza used the ""lure of quick riches"" to get people to invest. The way bitcoin operates means those who help to verify transactions, a practice known as mining, are occasionally rewarded with virtual coins.  Garza told investors in two separate schemes, GAW Miners and ZenMiner, that he had enough computer power to carry out sufficient mining to generate a lot of bitcoins.  In fact, said the SEC, he was running a fraudulent ""ponzi"" scheme which used cash from new investors to reward those who joined earlier.  ""Most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed,"" said the SEC. It said about 10,000 investors handed over more than $20m to Garza for the mining schemes. Few got back the money they invested, it added.  Both companies have now been shut down.  In 2014, when Garza was running the con from his home in Connecticut each bitcoin was worth about $450.

Mark Karpeles was chief executive of MtGox when it collapsed in 2014, following the loss of 850,000 bitcoins, then worth nearly $0.4bn (£0.3bn). In its bankruptcy filing, MtGox blamed the loss on hackers. It later said it had found 200,000 bitcoins in old digital wallets. The prosecution claims that Mr Karpeles transferred 341 million yen ($3 million) from a MtGox account into an account registered in his own name during the last quarter of 2013.  Mr Karpeles' lawyers deny that this was embezzlement. ""I swear to God that I am innocent,"" he is reported to have told the court. Today, one bitcoin is worth £1,800, or $2,300, but the digital currency is notoriously volatile. To process bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition, the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new bitcoins are produced each day.  There are currently about 15 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.

South Korea-based Bithumb has said that it believes personal details of more than 30,000 of its customers were stolen as a result. It appears the data was subsequently used to fool users into letting thieves steal funds from their accounts. Bithumb has promised compensation. But the Korea Internet and Security Agency, a local government-empowered watchdog, has launched an inquiry into the matter, according to the Yonhap news agency. Bithumb allows its members to buy and sell the virtual currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is South Korea's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, based on recent trading volumes, and one of the five largest in the world. The breach is reported to have occurred in February, and is said to have involved an employee's home PC rather than computer servers at the firm's headquarters. Bithumb is reported to have discovered the breach only on 29 June and reported it to the authorities the next day. Although a notice posted to the company's site said the leaked data did not contain passwords, dozens of customers have reported receiving follow-up scam calls and texts in June that persuaded them to share their accounts' authentication codes.

""Please don't do this,"" the company said via a tweet.  A spokesman for Twitter declined to confirm to the BBC how many people have succumbed to the hoax so far. Twitter has automatically prevented users under 13 from using the social network since May last year and its terms of use state that the social network is ""not directed to children.""

The gang is believed to have laundered some $4bn (£3bn) over several years.  Mr Vinnik is said to be the ""brain"" behind the illegal operations. He has so far made no public comments.

102,How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40703182,2017-07-24 23:16:15+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Why is the art world getting excited about digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain? Eleesa Dadiani owns and runs an art gallery in London's famous Cork Street. She was born in Georgia in the Caucasus and was ""breastfed by gypsies"". But she is also a passionate believer in the power of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. When we meet she is busy preparing for an exhibition of sculptures made from the exhausts of former Formula 1 racing cars. One of these strange rib-cage-like creations made from the super-strong alloy inconel has been gold-plated and will sell for about £35,000. ""These are pieces of history,"" she tells me. In a first for the tradition-bound art world of Cork Street, her international clientele will have the opportunity to pay using Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency underpinned by blockchain technology. The gallery will also accept other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Litecoin, and soon, Monero, she says. Why? ""This is not a demand-driven decision at all, it's intuitive based on the way things are going,"" she says. She believes paying by cryptocurrency will become as normal as paying by cash or credit card. She also hopes it will attract a new, non-traditional type of art investor. Blockchain, the underlying technology, is a digital ledger or record of transactions that is distributed across, and verified by, thousands of computers in a network. Once the network has reached a consensus that a transaction has happened, the ledger is updated and cannot be tampered with.    ""Blockchain is a borderless, open source, decentralised peer-to-peer network that governments cannot shut down,"" she says. ""For me, the blockchain is going to be the biggest thing since the internet."" And the fact that there is no centralised body - like a bank head office, for example - makes cryptocurrencies safer, she argues, despite their reputation for being volatile, high-risk and the favourite ""store of value"" for criminals and hackers.  Bitcoin payments can be anonymous and potentially beyond the grasp of tax authorities, but this isn't the reason she's offering payment by cryptocurrency, she assures me.  So how easy is it to accept a Bitcoin payment? ""It's really very simple,"" she explains. ""I give the client my public key [a long string of letters and numbers] and they use that to send bitcoin to my account from their digital wallet or bitcoin exchange,"" she says.  ""My wallet is linked to my personal bank so I can then convert those bitcoins into pounds, euros or dollars.""  Ms Dadiani is such a fan of cryptocurrencies - she trades in them as well - that she is launching her own version, Dadicoin, later this year. The $60bn art world in general is warming to the potential of cryptocurrencies, partly because of blockchain's dual ability to establish the provenance of works of art and thereby reduce the reliance on brokers and other middlemen. Marcelo Garcia Casil, for example, is chief executive and co-founder of Maecenas, an online marketplace that will enable art owners to sell shares in their expensive works of art (worth more than $1m) and raise money far more cheaply than they could though a bank. And the owners also get to keep possession of their artworks while sharing up to 49% of the ownership. Investors, who ordinarily wouldn't be able to afford multi-million-dollar works of art, will be able buy shares or units in the work using cryptocurrency. They will then be able to sell these units later in the marketplace. Each transaction is recorded cryptographically on the Ethereum blockchain. ""We want to make fine art accessible for everyone,"" says Mr Casil, who was born in Argentina, now lives in Singapore, and has a background in investment banking.  ""The old auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have controlled the art market for centuries, so we think the opportunity for disruption is huge."" Establishing the authenticity of works of art is critical to their value, and this will still need to be done by skilled professionals, admits Mr Casil. ""But once the provenance has been recorded in the blockchain, you never have to do it again,"" he says. This takes a lot of cost out of the system. Maecenas has already attracted works of art worth $100m (£77m; 86m euros) in total, says Mr Casil, and the marketplace is due for launch in September. The art world has been flirting with Bitcoin for a few years now, despite the likes of auction house Sotheby's saying they have no plans to accept the currency. In April 2015, the Austrian Museum of Applied Art/Contemporary Art (MAK) was the first museum in the world to buy a work of art using Bitcoin. Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel created a limited-edition screensaver that was cryptographically authenticated through blockchain. And online gallery Cointemporary exhibits digital artworks by international contemporary artists that can only be bought with Bitcoin. Purchases are handled by Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain establishes the chain of ownership, preventing anyone from stealing or tampering with the work. But will Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ever really become a mainstream alternative to traditional money? Views differ widely. In Japan, there is a big move to equip 260,000 retail locations with bitcoin capability, and a few high-street retailers, such as Lush, have opted to accept the currency. But Joe Pindar, a director at cyber-security company Gemalto, says: ""At present there are very few businesses accepting bitcoin as a payment method - less than 1% of all retailers.  ""The biggest barrier to adoption is the length of time it takes to settle a payment in person, with transactions taking tens of minutes.  Despite this, Mr Pindar says several large retailers have been experimenting with the cryptocurrency, but may choose ""to adopt bitcoin for online purchases only, where time to process a payment is less important."" The currency's volatility is an issue - the value of one bitcoin topped $3,000 in June, before crashing to below $1,900 in July - and transactions are taking longer and longer to process.  This is largely to do with the rules governing how Bitcoin works, and there is currently a big row over how the issue should be resolved. It could be that blockchain proves to be more important to the art world than its flashier Bitcoin offspring.",0.18217906976744186,0.0652093610523843

The weakening yuan has prompted many people to try to buy foreign currencies.  The Bitcoin currency had soared to record highs in the first days of 2017, a rise attributed largely to strong demand from China, where most Bitcoin trading takes place.

The crypto-currency relies on web-based transactions handled across thousands of computers and is used as an anonymous way to move money globally. As a result, some speculate that people in China are using it to circumnavigate strict government rules aimed at preventing money from leaving the country.

104,JP Morgan creates first US bank-backed crypto-currency,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47240760,2019-02-14 15:58:19+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"US investment bank JP Morgan has created a crypto-currency to help settle payments between clients in its wholesale payments business. JPM Coin is the first digital currency to be backed by a major US bank.  The crypto-currency, which runs on blockchain technology, has been used successfully to move money between the bank and a client account. JP Morgan says it sees potential in using digital coins to reduce risk and enable instant transfers. Although JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon has publicly criticised Bitcoin - the first crypto-currency in existence - on several occasions, the bank says it has always ""believed in the potential of blockchain technology"". ""We are supportive of crypto-currencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated,"" Umar Farooq, JP Morgan's head of Digital Treasury Services and Blockchain, wrote in an online Q&A page. Virtual currencies can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house.  Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users.  For this reason, crypto-currencies are attractive to people who want to make illegal purchases on the Dark Web - a part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines.  A blockchain is a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. This information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government. The concept was designed to ensure security and anonymity for users, by preventing tampering or hijacking of the network. Once published, the information in a certain block can't be changed. If people try to tamper with that information, it becomes obvious. This is a powerful concept. Ten years ago, blockchain was combined with other technologies to create cryptocurrencies, and the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. No. JPM Coin is not for retail customers - it will be used internally by JP Morgan to enable the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional accounts. When a JP Morgan client deposits money into an account, the money is converted into an equivalent number of JPM Coins, so $1m equals one million JPM coins. The client can then use the coins to perform transactions over the bank's blockchain network Quorum with other clients, for example money movement or payments in securities transactions. Once the transactions have been performed, holders of JPM Coins can redeem them for US dollars from the bank. Not everyone is convinced that JP Morgan needed to create its own digital currency. A blockchain is designed to be decentralised, so no one party has control over transactions being sent over the network. This is the opposite of the JPM Coin concept. ""It doesn't even need a blockchain at all because JP Morgan runs it. They could do it on a website and database they run,"" David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain: Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum & Smart Contracts, told the BBC. ""It isn't like Bitcoin that aren't under anybody's control - it's a centrally controlled thing that sounds vaguely like crypto-currency."" JP Morgan says that it is trialling crypto-currency and blockchain in order to speed up payment transfers, as well as reducing clients' counterparty and settlement risk, and decreasing capital requirements. However, Mr Gerard is sceptical and does not believe that the bank needs the technology to speed up transactions.  JP Morgan's Umar Farooq told the BBC that JP Morgan is using blockchain because of the improvements in speeds and security that the technology offers. Because of the privacy that blockchain enables, the bank envisions having a network whereby clients, such as large banks, can move coins between themselves on the network, and JP Morgan does not see these transactions. However, the bank stressed that all information required by regulators will continue to be tracked. Clients will only be able to use the blockchain network if they have been approved by regulators and have passed money laundering checks.  ""There is a possibility in the future of a blockchain that is private, except from the regulator,"" said Mr Farooq.  ""There are various ways to make the regulatory regimes across the world stronger over time.""",0.16472058823529412,0.06949404761904762

It closed at $1,268 on Thursday while a troy ounce of gold stood at $1,233.  The current high is being attributed to surging demand in China, where authorities warn it is used to channel money out of the country.  The past months' surge is a major reversal for Bitcoin, which plummeted in value in 2014 after the largest exchange collapsed.   The value of Bitcoin has been volatile since it was first launched in 2009, and many experts have questioned whether the crypto-currency will last. Earlier this year, Chinese authorities cracked down on Bitcoin trading in an attempt to stop money flowing out of the country illegally. But the closer scrutiny from Beijing only briefly sent the currency lower. After it had soared to record highs in January, it has since picked its steady rise in value.  Bitcoin is attractive to some users because of its anonymity, as well as its lack of government control.  The website Silk Road was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies amid allegations of drug dealing. Authorities seized millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin during the raids.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. Yet like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.  There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.

Somebody added the illegal images to the core ledger of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) by using a payment processor. This ledger, known as the blockchain, is a running record of crypto-currency transactions, shared among users of the platform. Experts have warned that abuse of blockchain tech is a growing problem. The blockchain is central to the way many crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin work and in theory stops people making fake transactions or manipulating their account balance. One key feature of the blockchain is that information added to it cannot be changed without significant effort.  In January, the amount of data that could be added to the BSV blockchain was increased significantly. Before that, people could generally add only short chunks of text or web links to the blockchain. But now it is possible to add full images in an encoded format.  Payment system Money Button said its service had been used to post the illegal images on the BSV blockchain in early February. UK laws state that the simple possession of indecent photographs of children is an offence and any distribution of such material can warrant a longer prison sentence. Jimmy Nguyen, founder of crypto-cash company nChain, which oversees the BSV currency, said it had ""zero tolerance"" for illegal use of the system.  ""The Bitcoin SV blockchain is not a place for criminal activity - and if you use it for illegal purposes, you will leave a digitally signed evidence trail that cannot be erased,"" he told BBC News.  ""We stand ready to work with global law enforcement authorities to stamp out this and any other illegal misuse of Bitcoin.""  Ryan Charles, founder of Money Button, said: ""Since most businesses increased the size of allowed data recently, making it possible to post large files, criminals are trying to push the limits."" The abuse images embedded in the BSV blockchain were spotted when they appeared on Bitcoinfiles.org. The website lets people browse a rolling list of messages and other content added to the blockchain.  The appearance of the images prompted police to investigate. Bitcoinfiles.org has since closed the blockchain browsing service. In addition, Money Button has banned the user that uploaded the material. It has also put in place filtering systems to spot when anyone tries to upload similar content. Money Button is part-funded by nChain. ""Criminals should understand that everything on the blockchain is signed, time-stamped, and linked to everything else,"" said Mr Charles.  ""We have all the information we need to track down criminals and prosecute them."" Information about the person who uploaded the images has been passed to the authorities. Eric Erstu, who runs the Cryptograffiti website that lets people read messages embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain, said: ""There is nothing that could have prevented this from happening in other blockchains. ""It takes special care to seek and find illegal content from any block chain, as it is not a trivial process,"" he told BBC News. ""As for law enforcement, they would have to do the good old detective work in hope of tracking down the person who uploaded the illegal content on the block chain.   ""Since everything you do on the blockchain is immutable, tracking down criminals is not too difficult."" Blockchain researcher Roman Matzutt, from the University of Aachen, in Germany, who has studied the problem of people uploading illegal content to the blockchain, warned it had become a ""pressing issue"". He said there was ""ongoing research"" to find ways to remove such content from blockchains but these were ""not yet mature"".  And there was a ""lack of sufficient sustainable solutions apart from making content insertion into public blockchains hard"".",-0.29622500000000007,-0.04577014833711262

At the start of 2016, single coins were only worth around $435 but their value has climbed steadily all year.  The steady upward progress has continued despite regular hack attacks on virtual currency exchanges in which coins have been stolen. Experts said the rise in value was linked to the long-term depreciation of the Chinese Yuan. The Chinese currency has dropped about 7% in value during 2016, said Reuters. The majority of Bitcoin currency trading takes place in China as it allows people to skirt restrictive local laws that limit how much money Chinese people can swap.  Charles Hayter, founder of the Cryptocompare website that watches virtual currencies, said global political uncertainty and Indian moves to control paper currency were also driving people to buy Bitcoins.  If those trends continued, he told Reuters, many more people may be tempted to buy Bitcoins as they could be seen as a ""flight to safety"".  Hackers have also been tempted by the rising value of the virtual coins. In August Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex suffered a major hack attack in which bitcoins worth $65m were thought to be taken.  Bitcoin values dropped about 10% when the news of the hack attack was made public The virtual currency has yet to reach the heights it managed in late 2013 when each coin was worth more than $1,000.

108,Bitcoin entrepreneur Amir Taaki quizzed over fighting in Syria,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39417937,2017-03-29 15:25:35+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A London-based software developer and ""hacker"" has said he is under police investigation after going to Syria to fight against the Islamic State group. Amir Taaki, 29, a leading developer of online currency Bitcoin, was once named by Forbes as one of the most influential young people in technology. Mr Taaki told the BBC he returned to the UK from Syria in 2016 and has spent the past 12 months on police bail. The Foreign Office warns people not to travel to Syria for any reason. ""When I discovered Rojava [the term Kurds use to refer to northern or Syrian Kurdistan] I felt I had to go there,"" he told the BBC. ""At first, I was completely scared - I thought I was going to die. ""I got sent to the frontline. I had no training, and I was given a Kalashnikov. I learnt how to use a gun on the way, another Western fighter showed me."" Mr Taaki says he spent three and half months fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units [YPG] military group and experienced several battles against IS. He says he was not injured in the fighting, except in one incident, he tells me laughing: ""I did fall into a trench."" When asked ""Did you kill anyone?"" he explains that his experiences in battles with IS were at long range, so it is impossible to tell. ""I found myself on the front with a gun, I had to fight. But I wanted to go elsewhere, where my skills would be useful."" Mr Taaki says he later met with the economics committee of Rojava and began helping the Kurds with local projects, such as a crowd-funding campaign which raised money and then built fertilizer factories to help farmers growing food. The Syrian Kurds are not only fighting to defeat IS, but they have the aim of creating a new kind of socialist society.  This Kurdish vision is based on revolutionary ideas of living in a much less hierarchical way than the West - a system called ""democratic confederalism"". This is what Amir Taaki says truly inspired him to travel to the conflict. ""My main goal with going to Rojava was not because I opposed Isis, it's because I support their [the Kurds'] revolution. I support their politics and their struggle.  ""It is the only solution for lasting peace in the Middle East."" Bitcoin, he believes, could help the Syrian Kurds. ""They're trying to create a people's economy. To establish a decentralised economy, you need decentralised money.  ""Rojava's under embargo, so there's no way to move money in or out. So we have to actually create our own Bitcoin economies. ""Now we have a technological tool for people to freely organise outside state system. Because it is a currency not controlled by central banks."" But software previously developed by Amir Taaki to allow untraceable, anonymous transactions, has been criticised by authorities because it may be used for money laundering or to fund organised terror groups. When he returned to London in 2016, Mr Taaki says he was arrested at the airport and questioned under counter-terror legislation. ""I was not expecting it at all,"" he says. ""They stopped the plane, and they arrested me. They confiscated computers, phones and everything"". He says he has been told by police that he remains under investigation. ""I don't support terrorism or terrorist acts. What's the political motive in keeping an investigation open against me?"" There are no reliable figures for how many British people have gone to fight with the Kurds.  The YPG itself estimates that ""hundreds"" of volunteers from many countries have fought with it. The YPG is not a banned group in the UK, but is considered a terror organisation by Turkey, which has a history of conflict with the Kurds. Mr Taaki was once tipped to be a future billionaire. He could work in Sillicon Valley and enjoy an incredible career. So why not, I ask? ""I could go and live on a beach in Brazil and party,"" he tells me. ""I don't want that, though."" When challenged on why he needed to pick up a gun at all, he replies: ""I'm glad about it, to be honest, it was an important experience to have."" A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""Everyone who returns from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be reviewed by the police to determine if they have committed criminal offences and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.""

109,Does Bitcoin still matter?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36197703,2016-05-05 23:08:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Craig Wright's assertion that he was the creator of Bitcoin this week occurred at the same time as thousands of members of a growing industry tied to the virtual currency attended the Consensus 2016 conference in New York. Attendees debated the truth of Wright's claims, but also grappled with the more poignant question of whether Bitcoin still matters? Bitcoin has come a long way since its start. What was once marketed as a global currency - free from government restrictions - is now seen as a burgeoning technology that can help improve the world's financial system and change how information and assets are stored and shared.  Hundreds of new companies have started that focus on creating blockchains, the underlying ledger system on which Bitcoin is based.  The answer to Bitcoin's relevance depends on whether you are talking about the digital currency or the industry.  Because Bitcoin was the first digital currency, the sector as a whole is often referred to as the Bitcoin industry.  It now prefers to be called blockchain - after the technology which underpins Bitcoin.  The currency is struggling because of strains on its technology and persistent doubts about when and if it can become a mainstream form of money.  The blockchain industry however is thriving as new uses for the technology continue to be dreamed up and investors continue to fund them.  ""Digital currency is now a misnomer for Bitcoin,"" says Erik Voorhees, chief executive officer for Shape Shift, a digital currency exchange.  ""It can be used as currency, but it can be used for many things."" Blockchains rely on cryptography to allow a set of computers to make changes to a global record without needing a central actor. Removing the middleman cuts costs in almost every sector.  The blockchain is a ledger that records everything that happens to a collection of data known as a ""block"" in a chronological order or ""chain"".  As a currency this is an important feature because it allows users to be sure their digital money is one of a kind, the same way each note in your wallet is unique.  ""Blockchain tech will be the way we create assets because it allows you to transfer digital information without copying,"" says Adam Ludwin, chief executive of Chain.com, which builds blockchain networks.  Blockchain can be used to track the history of all sorts of information and maintain its value, so, for example, doctors could use it to update medical records.  Since each change to a blockchain is made simultaneously across the whole network, no information is lost and because changes cannot be undone the system maintains its transparency. A special key is needed to make changes to each block, so individuals can keep their records safe by protecting that key.  The original code for Bitcoin was designed to produce a fixed amount. Its popularity has meant the digital currency is coming to its limit faster than many expected.  Among Bitcoin's core engineers there is a division about how to fix this problem.  One group advocates doubling the size of the ""blocks"" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term. Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones.  For companies that are thinking of using blockchain tech or digital currency, this schism makes it hard to choose Bitcoin.  ""This is sending signals that are making engineers worried,"" says Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers. ""People are waiting to see what happens before launching."" Almost since Bitcoin's creation there have been copycats. As more industries warmed to the idea of blockchain these imitators began to look less like virtual currencies and more like digital record keepers.   Some of these are public - allowing anyone to join and grow the chain - while others are private to ensure only trusted parties have access, an approach favoured by banks.  This explosions of new blockchains has created a need for inter-ledger operators. These companies allow people to exchange digital assets from one blockchain to another.  ""Blockchain is another database and it's impractical to think of the world working on one database,"" says Chris Larsen, the chief executive of global financial settlement company Ripple.  For believers in a government-free digital currency, Bitcoin is the still the biggest player.  Virtual currencies could still have a place in finance, particularly in countries with less stable governments and economies. Governments though have been looking for ways to add regulation, in an effort to prevent tax dodging, money laundering and other criminal activities that were associated with the early Bitcoin days. Eventually blockchains could allow users to exchange the rights to all sorts of assets, like houses or stocks, update records and make payments without relying on a third party to verify the transaction.  But for this to become a reality more users will have to join blockchains. ",0.16105135135135135,0.07580583830583831
110,What is Revolut?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47768661,2019-04-01 23:01:31+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"British financial technology company Revolut has been in the news frequently in recent months. The firm, which provides mobile app-based current accounts as an alternative to physical banks, has been referred by some as a ""tech super star"".   Why is Revolut so controversial?  Revolut offers a range of digital banking services in a mobile app targeted at young tech-savvy users, including: With standard accounts, users get a free UK current account and a free euro IBAN account. There are no fees on exchanging in 24 currencies, up to £5,000 a month, and you can withdraw up to £200 a month from cash machines.  Revolut also offers monthly subscription plans with higher thresholds for no fees, as well as instant access to crypto-currencies, cash back, travel and concierge service.  Revolut's services are currently only available in Europe, but the firm has plans to expand into North America, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong soon. It was not a bank when it started, but Revolut announced in December that it had been granted an EU banking licence by the European Central Bank. It still aims to acquire a full UK banking licence. It has already attained the status of a tech ""unicorn"" - a term used to describe private start-ups valued at more than $1bn (£740m). Revolut was founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. Mr Storonsky is Russian-born, but carries a British passport and has lived in the UK since the age of 20. Mr Yatsenko is Ukranian British, and has lived in the UK since 2010. Mr Yatsenko and Mr Storonsky created start-up Revolut and launched it in July 2015 at the Level39 tech accelerator in Canary Wharf.  Prior to setting up Revolut, Mr Storonsky worked for Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers, while Mr Yatsenko spent five years building financial systems for major investment banks.  The duo said that they started Revolut because they were frustrated with the fact that traditional banks were taking so long to introduce digital banking services for younger customers, who prefer to access most services through their smartphones.  Mr Yatsenko serves as Revolut's chief technology officer, while Mr Storonsky is chief executive of the firm. As of March, Revolut says it reached 4.5 million customers - 1.6 million customers are located in the UK alone. Revolut is currently valued at $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from its most recent fundraising.  The three-year-old firm's growth has been impressive - its customer numbers trebled to 1.2 million in 2017, while revenues increased five fold to £12.8m. In September, Revolut said 7,000 new accounts were being opened a day, and that it was processing $3bn in transactions a month. In February, Revolut launched an advertising campaign featuring an ad that highlighted the number of people who ordered a takeaway meal for one on Valentine's Day in 2018. The ad, which asked, ""You ok, hun?"", sparked a backlash on Twitter. Revolut was accused of ""shaming"" single people and being both ""intrusive"" and ""tone-deaf"". It then turned out that the ad - which said 12,750 people ordered a single takeaway meal on Valentine's Day - was using fictitious figures.  Several people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the advert, but since it was outside the ASA's scope, it referred the matter to the FCA. In February, the Telegraph said that in the summer of 2018, Revolut disabled a system designed to automatically halt transactions to individuals who matched against sanctions lists.  Sanctions lists contain the names of individuals whose assets have been frozen and include those connected with chemical weapons violations as well as members of the Islamic State. The company's lawyers drafted a letter to the FCA about the change, but it was never sent. This draft letter was later leaked to journalists. In the letter, which the BBC has seen, Revolut lawyers stated that the company's head of compliance technology changed systems so that transactions that potentially matched against sanctions lists were not halted. Instead the system flagged the transaction for inspection but still allowed it to go through. Revolut told the BBC that: ""At no point did Revolut stop checking transactions for sanctions compliance last year. Nor was there any failure in our sanctions screening procedures.""   On 28 February, it was reported that Revolut's chief financial officer Peter O'Higgins was stepping down after spending three years with the company. Mr Storonsky wrote in a blog post on 1 March that Mr O'Higgins had decided to step down because he felt that the business would ""require someone with global retail banking experience"" as Revolut applied to become a licensed bank in multiple jurisdictions. Media reports at the time suggested that the timing of Mr O'Higgins' resignation was to do with the allegations made against it, but the company stoutly denies it.  ""Any suggestion that Peter's resignation is in any way, shape or form connected to this roll-out is utterly false and damaging,"" wrote Mr Storonsky in his blog. ""Peter has since expressed to me that he has been hurt by this suggestion and sad that his departure has been tainted in this way."" A BBC investigation has discovered that a Revolut employee made a complaint to the FCA in 2016, asking it to investigate the compliance of Revolut and the conduct of its chief executive. The whistleblower told the BBC that Revolut's systems for flagging suspect payments were ""utterly inadequate"". Revolut denied the allegation and told the BBC this was ""the first time Revolut has been made aware of any such complaint, which appears to have been made by a former employee who left the company several years ago."" The BBC understands that in the past three years, Revolut has seen the departure of two chief risk officers, two money laundering reporting officers, a chief compliance officer and a chief finance officer, amongst other roles.",-0.03884615384615384,0.011837892046225379

It traded as high as $1,029 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk data. Analysts are attributing its jump to increased demand from China, which is where most Bitcoin trading takes place. Bitcoin relies on web-based transactions handled across thousands of computers and is used as an anonymous way to move money globally. As a result, some speculate that people in China are using it to circumnavigate strict government rules aimed at preventing money from leaving the country. The value of China's currency, the renminbi, fell by about 7% last year. In contrast, Bitcoin's value rose by 125% in 2016, making it the world's best-performing currency when compared with its central bank-issued peers. ""The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making Bitcoin look like a viable, if high-risk, alternative,"" said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association. David Moskowitz, the founder of Coin Republic, a Singapore-based Bitcoin brokerage, believes some investors now see the currency as a haven asset. ""The run-up since November could be due to Indian demonitisation followed by Venezuela capital controls and rumours of similar actions in more countries,"" he told the BBC. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.  There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned. The value of Bitcoin has been volatile since it was first launched in 2009, and many experts have questioned whether the crypto-currency will last. The last time Bitcoin was trading above $1000 was in late 2013. But later that year the currency experienced daily price swings of as much as 40% after the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange was hacked and saw the currency plunge to under $400. However, some experts expect Bitcoin to continue its recent strong run. ""As asserted by analysts, 2017 is expected to be a banner year, one that could finally lead the price to pass its all-time high of $1,216.7 set in 2013,"" CoinDesk said. Mr Moskowitz said: ""At some point there will be a correction but my outlook is still very positive as Bitcoin has shown its resilience. ""It's been declared dead 115 times and is still the best way to send value directly from person to person without anyone being able to prevent that transfer."" There are also more Bitcoins in circulation than ever before and it is estimated 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes.

The scheme - run by Trendon Shavers - promised high returns to those who backed bitcoin-related investments. Instead of investing cash, Shavers used it to pay early investors in the scheme and to amass bitcoins. Investors who backed the scheme lost about $1.23m (£940,000) in total, said Shavers' lawyers. Shavers has been ordered by the court to repay the money which investors lost.  He was arrested in 2014 for running the scheme which, at one point, controlled about 764,000 bitcoins. In 2011-12, when the scheme was operating, this was worth approximately $4.5m, comprising of 7% of all bitcoins in circulation.  Investors were attracted by Shavers offering them the chance to earn 7% interest every week. He said the returns to fund these rewards would be generated when he traded bitcoins across different exchanges.  Only a fraction of the bitcoins bought were invested and the rest were used to pay back those who were first to join the scheme. In addition, court papers revealed, Shavers used more than $220,000 of the cash to buy a BMW, holiday in Las Vegas and cover family expenses. ""I don't think this is something I'm ever going to get over but I'm going to try to make things right,"" said Shavers in court, telling the judge that he ""royally messed up"". US federal sentencing guidelines suggested Shavers would spend three years in jail but the judge reduced the sentence because of the ""honest work"" the Texan has done since his arrest. Shavers now makes his living as a cook.  He is believed to be the first person to face federal securities fraud charges involving bitcoins.",0.005046666666666666,0.09193650793650794

The trial scheme, in the town of Zug, will begin on 1 July and run until the end of the year, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation reports. Residents will be able to make payments of up to 200 Swiss francs ($200; £140) using the crypto-currency, in what the broadcaster says is a world first. Mayor Dolfi Mueller says the council wants to show its ""openness to new technologies"" and cater to local financial technology companies. The area is known as the ""crypto-valley"", as it hosts more than a dozen companies specialising in Bitcoin-related activities. At the end of the trial period, the council will decide on whether to expand Bitcoin payments to other government services.  Not all local officials are convinced that it's a smart move. ""It is highly concerning that a state institution should accept Bitcoin, since it is not a secure currency,"" councillor Gregor Bruhin tells Neue Zuercher Zeitung. ""The town of Zug could undermine the status of cash with its actions,"" he says. Mayor Mueller seems unconcerned though, telling the paper: ""I can imagine that in the near future it will be possible to pay your tax bill with Bitcoin.""

From 11 November, customers will be able to trade Swiss francs for Bitcoins using ticket machines. They will not be able to buy tickets with the web-based currency, though. The SBB said it had been testing customer demand for Bitcoin across the country, and had decided to launch a two-year pilot project. To buy Bitcoins, would-be purchasers will have to give a mobile phone number for identification.  Transactions will be capped at 500 Swiss Francs (£415 / $500) each. One Bitcoin currently equals around 708.64 Swiss Francs, but it is possible to buy fractions of the currency.  Swiss financial services company SweePay is providing the conversion service. ""There have been few possibilities to obtain Bitcoins in Switzerland until now,"" SBB said. ""With its 1,000-plus ticket machines, SBB operates a dense, around-the-clock distribution network that's suited for more than just ticket sales."" The ticket machine system may prove popular with people who have struggled to buy Bitcoins through their bank accounts, as many have reported high fees for international transactions and a delay before their funds arrive. Bitcoin - the world's first digital currency - has drawn interest as a way to move money around rapidly, without fees or bank involvement. Transfers are handled directly between users on the internet.  Back in July, the Swiss town of Zug launched a six-month scheme letting residents pay for public services using Bitcoin.

115,Back to the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin affair,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36575524,2016-06-20 12:11:33+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"At the beginning of May, it seemed that a great mystery had been solved. An Australian academic and entrepreneur, Craig Wright, identified himself as Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the crypto-currency Bitcoin.  But, over the following days, the proof he offered was torn apart, not just by angry people on the Bitcoin forums but by a number of authorities on cryptography.  After first promising more evidence, Dr Wright then wrote a blog saying he did not have the strength to continue and retired from public view. Nakamoto's true identity appeared as opaque as ever - the Australian had not proved his case, but nor had it been disproved. Now, though, we have a whole new collection of evidence, in the form of a 35,000-word article about the Nakamoto affair in the London Review of Books. The author is the journalist and novelist Andrew O'Hagan, whose work includes a fascinating and hilarious account of his time trying to be the ghost writer of Julian Assange's autobiography. It seems Mr O'Hagan has an appetite for driven and difficult high-performing geeky types, because he spent six months with Craig Wright.  That meant he was there right through the period when Dr Wright was first outed as a potential Nakamoto last December, then dismissed as a fraud, and later through his own ""self-outing"" and the aftermath. It is a gripping and beautifully written tale, more a short novel than a magazine article.  We learn all sorts of new details about Dr Wright's career, his claims about his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, and his reasons for choosing to identify himself as Nakamoto seven years after the currency was created. To me, the key revelation is about this motivation.  He had told the BBC that he had not wanted to come out into the spotlight but needed to dispel damaging rumours affecting his family, friends and colleagues.  But O'Hagan shows us something rather different - a man under intense pressure from business associates who stood to profit from him if he could be shown to be Nakamoto. These people had signed a deal with Dr Wright in June last year, which saw them pay off his debts, including legal fees incurred in a battle with the Australian tax authorities.  Then, they had a plan for him. ""They would bring Wright to London and set up a research and development centre for him, with around 30 staff working under him,"" O'Hagan writes. ""They would complete the work on his inventions and patent applications - he appeared to have hundreds of them - and the whole lot would be sold as the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, who would be unmasked as part of the project."" The intellectual property, which he had already created and would now augment, would be worth as much as $1bn (£700m) with the Nakamoto name attached, so they would all end up very rich indeed.   That may sound fanciful, but Dr Wright's research was into the block chain, the technology underlying Bitcoin, and the world's big banks are rushing to invest in exploring its potential. Now, they may have had dollar signs in their eyes, but Dr Wright's backers certainly seemed to believe he was Nakamoto, and O'Hagan outlines some new evidence that supports that view. He spends days talking to Dr Wright about his relationship with Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013 and is thought by many to have played a big part in the creation of Bitcoin.  With some reluctance, Dr Wright eventually supplies some emails that seem to suggest the two worked together on the 2008 Nakamoto white paper explaining the idea of the ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"". O'Hagan goes to meet Dr Wright's ex-wife, who stands up a story about the two men meeting at a conference in Orlando in 2009 -  because she came along too.  She gives a detailed account of their meeting and the way Dr Wright hero-worshipped Mr Kleiman, which rings true coming from someone who has no reason to lie. There is a document about a trust fund set up by Dr Wright to hold some bitcoins for Mr Kleiman, along with a promise not to reveal the identity behind Nakamoto's email address. And there are minutes of a meeting between the Australian tax authorities and Dr Wright's business, where his advisor appears to suggest that he possessed 1.1m bitcoins - worth nearly £600m at the current exchange rate. There is also an intriguing tale about a meeting between Dr Wright and Ross Ulbricht, the man now serving a life sentence in the United States for setting up the Silk Road, the bitcoin-fuelled drug and gun trading site. And, then, we get a behind-the-scenes account of what happened when this brilliant, difficult, angry man - described by one colleague as ""like Steve Jobs but only worse"" - went public, in separate meetings with the BBC, the Economist and GQ, and the days afterwards, when everything fell apart. As someone who played a part in that saga - and still asks himself whether he should have asked better questions of Dr Wright - I was just a little disappointed with this climax to the story.  The author seems more removed from the action at this point than in the months before the denouement. Here is an example: on the Wednesday after the big reveal on Monday 2 May, Dr Wright agreed to undertake a much simpler proof of his identity than he had offered before.  He asked me, and the two Bitcoin experts who had verified his story - Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen - to send a small amount of bitcoins to an address known to be linked to Nakamoto.  He would then send it back, proving his claims to the identity. The money was sent but never returned.  What was going on in the hours between us being invited to take part in this proof and the moment when we were told it was ""on hold""?  The only reason we get for Dr Wright's bizarre behaviour, which sabotaged everything he had worked for, comes in the form of an email to O'Hagan.  He sends the writer a news story that suggests the father of Bitcoin might be arrested for helping to facilitate terrorism by allowing people to buy weapons anonymously.  Dr Wright, it seems, decided he would prefer to be called a fraud than risk spending years in jail. This seems unconvincing.  After all, he had been planning to out himself for months - albeit under pressure from his backers - so why this sudden fear of the consequences now?  The other question left hanging is why the backers who had invested so much in their Nakamoto had not demanded more proof from him at an earlier stage. In the end, we are left uncertain about Dr Wright's true role in the creation of Bitcoin.  It seems very likely he was involved, perhaps as part of a team that included Dave Kleiman and Hal Finney, the recipient of the first transaction with the currency. He may have exaggerated his contribution, he may have constructed a very elaborate fantasy  - or this fragile personality may have lost his nerve as he realised that his life would never be the same again once he was Craig ""Nakamoto"" Wright. If you are expecting O'Hagan to reveal the truth behind Bitcoin's creation myth, you will be left disappointed.  But if you enjoy a ripping yarn - with some piercing insights into geek culture - then you will find the Satoshi Affair an engrossing way to spend a couple of hours.",0.04784545454545453,0.08798270857929948

All transactions on the virtual exchange have been suspended while the security breach is investigated. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said that it was ""deeply concerned about the issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it"". The hack is one of the biggest thefts in bitcoin's history and is being treated as a ""major deal"" by many in the virtual currency community. ""Unfortunately, we continue to have vulnerabilities in the form of exchanges and wallets,"" former Singapore-based bitcoin broker David Moskowitz told the BBC. ""The vulnerabilities almost always occur on the exchange or wallet side and this is an area that continues to need improvement and more secure protocols, no different than when a bank gets robbed.""   Securing bitcoin trading platforms has been a key challenge, with hacking and thefts seen as the biggest threats. In 2014, the Tokyo-based Mt Gox trading exchange declared bankruptcy when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished or were stolen.

117,Bitcoin rewards halve for virtual cash money miners,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36763524,2016-07-11 13:10:45+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The financial rewards for being involved with the Bitcoin virtual currency have been halved. Before 9 July, a regular reward of 25 bitcoins was handed out to those who were first to verify which coins had been spent. Now, the leading team of ""miners"" who verify a chunk of global transactions will receive only 12.5 bitcoins.  The halving of the reward is scheduled to take place every four years to limit bitcoin inflation. Created in 2008, bitcoins have slowly become accepted as a form of payment by increasing numbers of shops, stores and services. One of the latest to back Bitcoin is cab company Uber, which has started letting passengers in Argentina pay for journeys using a Xapo debit card they can fill with bitcoins. Bitcoin miners are essential to the operation of the virtual currency because they collaborate to maintain the central record of transactions known as the blockchain. Verifying a chunk of transactions, known as a block, involves a complicated mathematical operation, and many miners use dedicated hardware to crank through the possible solutions to the cryptographic puzzle it represents. The mining process is carefully engineered to limit the opportunities for fraud and to ensure coins are handed out on a regular basis.  The financial reward for solving the puzzle also helps motivate people to stay involved. The first halving event took place in 2012, when the reward for mining a block dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25. One bitcoin is now worth about £500 ($645), making the reward each time a block is added to the blockchain equal to about £6,244. Many mining pools operating thousands of dedicated computers seeking to be the first to get the solution to the bitcoin puzzle and reap a reward operate on very thin margins.  Reuters reports one company, Sweden's KnCMiner, filed for bankruptcy in May, citing the losses it would suffer when the reward halving took place.  Competition among miners has increased thanks to the intervention of many Chinese companies, who are now thought to control about two-thirds of the computational power working on Bitcoin's blockchain. Daniel Masters, who runs a bitcoin-based hedge fund, told Reuters: ""It turned out that the Chinese, who really stormed into the mining market in the last couple of years, could just do this whole thing cheaper.""",0.31263124999999997,0.0475

At the Consensus 2016 conference in New York, attendees told the BBC they wanted to see more proof before they would be ready to believe the claims.  Mr Wright spoke to the BBC claiming he created the crypto-currency.  Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, has confirmed the claim.  Mr Andresen said he travelled to London to meet Mr Wright who showed him proof that he and Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym adopted by Bitcoin's creator - were one and the same.  ""He signed in my presence using the private key from block one, the very first mined Bitcoin block, on a computer that I am convinced had not been tampered with,"" he said.  Each key is a unique digital code that is linked to specific bitcoins. But even he added: ""It is impossible to prove something like that 100%."" Scepticism about Mr Wright's claim has been fuelled by following the steps he put on his blog that, he said, show how to go about verifying cryptographic keys. Some queried the complicated series of steps in this process and the information they called upon. Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the process was ""maliciously resistant"" to validation. Mr Andresen said he could not explain why Mr Wright had chosen such a ""funky"" procedure as a proof.  Others at the Consensus conference were more openly sceptical. Vitalik Buterin, from the blockchain company Ethereum, said the very ""noisy"" way in which Mr Wright chose to make this announcement threw into question whether it was true.  ""In general, signal theory says if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something and you choose the noisy way chances are it's because you couldn't do the good way in the first place."" Eric Voorhees, founder of cryptocurrency trading app ShapeShift, also had his doubts.  ""I generally trust Gavin [Anderseen]'s opinions so I want to believe this but I'm not convinced yet,"" he said. Others were more willing to believe that the elusive Bitcoin creator had finally been revealed.  ""I think it would be good news if Satoshi Nakamoto is found,"" said Daniel Lipshitz, from bitcoin infrastructure company Gap 600.  He said while public proof from Mr Wright would be good, he trusted Mr Andresen and was willing to believe that he had seen compelling evidence.  The digital currency industry is still developing. It has moved from the shady criminal underworld it was first associated with. Bitcoin, and the underlying blockchain technology it is based on, are now being invested in by the finance industry looking for the next place for innovation.  ""It's not clear to me that if Craig Wright is Satoshi, or if it's someone else, that this is relevant to Bitcoin these days,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, who has studied the genesis of the digital currency. ""Some would argue that we are now living in a post-Satoshi world,"" he said. ""But I think Satoshi does matter, we should not dismiss their contribution."" However, he added, sessions at the Consensus conference and events in the wider world showed how the focus on the technology had shifted. Many financial firms were now looking at the blockchain that underlies bitcoin as a way to solve and streamline some long-standing payment processing problems.  ""The industry has moved,"" he said.

A blockchain-based smart plug that can adjust power consumption minute-by-minute has been created by technologists at Accenture. The blockchain is the automated ledger that underpins Bitcoin and tracks where the coins are spent and swapped. The plug shops for different power suppliers and will sign up for a cheaper tariff if it finds one. Accenture said the smart plug could help people on low incomes who pay directly for power. The smart plug modifies the basic Bitcoin blockchain technology to make it more active, said Emmanuel Viale, head of the Accenture team at the firm's French research lab that worked on the plug. Instead of just resolving and confirming transaction records, the Accenture work has changed the blockchain to let it negotiate deals on behalf of its owner.  ""It's about how we put more business behaviour or logic into the blockchain,"" said Mr Viale, adding that this essentially embeds a ""smart contract"" into the digital ledger.  The smart plug prototype works with other gadgets in the house that monitor power use. When demand is high or low it searches for energy prices and then uses the modified blockchain to switch suppliers if it finds a cheaper source. So far, said Mr Viale, the Accenture system was just a proof of concept, but it could help many people on lower incomes who pay for their power via a meter.  Being able to quickly shift suppliers could save this group more than £660m in the UK annually, suggests Accenture research. A blockchain-based system that can act on behalf of its owner might also prove useful as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous, said Mr Viale.  Managing many different gadgets might be tricky without a more centralised system, he said, Martin Garner, a mobile services expert at analyst firm CCS Insight, said blockchains were starting to crop up in many different areas including share trading, fishing rights databases and land registry claims. They had two chief attractions for the Internet of Things, he said.  ""They avoid dependence on any one supplier or ecosystem  - some users have concerns about the potential dominance of key internet players creating, for example, the Google-of-Things or the Amazon-of-Things,"" he said.  ""The second attraction is as a way of enabling autonomous trading between things, such as the appliances in your house being set up to re-order supplies from a pre-approved list of suppliers,"" he added.",0.3012823529411765,0.09701447245564891

Of course, there were two royal weddings this year: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May; and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in October, which may have added to the overall figures. ""Roxanne Pallett"" the former Emmerdale actor who courted controversy on Celebrity Big Brother after accusing housemate Ryan Thomas of punching her, came second in most-searched-for celebrities.

Celebrities who struggled with substance abuse took the third and fourth spots: ""Demi Lovato"", who had an apparent overdose, and ""Ant McPartlin"", who had well-documented struggles with rehab and recovery.  McPartlin took time off from his TV presenting roles including ITV's I'm a Celebrity - which was the top trending TV Show - after crashing his car while under the influence of alcohol. Despite being the most watched television drama last year, ""Bodyguard"" was pipped to the post by ""Killing Eve"" - numbers three and two respectively in the television category. Marvel's superhero film Black Panther was the fourth top trending overall query as well as being the most searched for movie title. It was the studio's first film to focus on Africa and feature a predominantly black cast. Black Panther was also one of the highest grossing movies of the year, taking more than $1bn (£800m) worldwide. Among the more prosaic searches in the ""How To...?"" list were ""How to bleed radiators?"" at number eight and ""How to put lights on a Christmas tree?"" at number nine.

122,Bitcoin: Is the crypto-currency doomed?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35343561,2016-01-19 08:02:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development. Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a ""failed"" project. Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development. So, is Bitcoin doomed? Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned. Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin. In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin ""mining"". Users have a ""bitcoin address"", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used. Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts. Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead. The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed. The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin. As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing.  Indeed, some transactions face significant delays, hampering payments. Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable. Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years.  In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time. He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network. Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB. But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted. He later wrote, ""It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable."" The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MB There are alternatives, however.  Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB. Bitcoin's history as a ""decentralised"" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature. Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation. Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers. Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say. ""This is a matter of perspective,"" he told the BBC. ""The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world."" However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted. ""I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology,"" Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC. Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added. Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog. One bitcoin is now worth $380 (£265), down from about $430 on Thursday. However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015. But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year. Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security. Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred. Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many. Bitcoin remains popular. There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data. It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight. But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head. Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen.  Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt.  But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet. Update: This report was changed on 19 January 2016 to clarify that some payments can take a considerable time to be processed rather than not going through at all.",-0.0852936170212766,0.09506754474839581

This week's turmoil seems to have been the result of the feuding which has seen Bitcoin Cash - itself a variant of the original Bitcoin - split into two currencies, with both of them plunging in value and the contagion spreading across the wider crypto-currency market. So is this just another dip in a volatile market or does this week tell us something more profound about the viability of crypto-currencies?  Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of the finance magazine Money Week and a long-term sceptic about Bitcoin, tells us she feels vindicated:  ""The things the old fuddy-duddies have been saying about crypto-currencies for the last couple of years turn out to be mainly true - that they're in the main vehicles for speculation, that the currencies in themselves have very little value. In most cases their value is around zero and that's where they're getting to gradually."" Bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 (£15,600) a year ago, before settling between $6,000 and $7,000 for much of this year, and then lurching down towards $4,000 this week. The true believers insist that it will bounce back as it has before.  Iqbal Gandham, of the crypto-currency trading firm eToro UK, gives us the startling prediction that Bitcoin will be worth anywhere between $500,000 and $1m over the next four or five years -  although he adds the proviso that if it does not get to that level then it will have failed as a currency. eToro has spent heavily on marketing, buying adverts on the London Underground and sponsoring Premier League football clubs.  As a result, it appears likely that it has enticed inexperienced investors into this market at a dangerous time, and I put it to Iqbal Gandham that many of them must be sitting on big losses.  ""Not really,"" he said, He said all investments had seen prices tumbling in recent weeks, with Apple and Amazon seeing very sharp falls in their shares.   They, of course, are real businesses with huge assets whose shares trade in tightly regulated markets - Bitcoin could hardly be more different. In the UK, the Treasury, Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have been discussing whether there needs to be tighter regulation for the last couple of years.  When I caught up with Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy for the FCA, he was keen to issue a warning: ""People will have to be aware that if they're thinking of investing in this space they could lose all their money."" He was less clear about whether regulation was coming: ""We do need to think about how suitable some of these investments - as they're perhaps being presented - really are for retail investors, ordinary customers."" Iqbal Gandham says his firm would welcome regulation although it is hard to see how the FCA would permit the marketing to football fans and tube travellers of what is essentially a gambling service. Merryn Somerset Webb is not completely dismissive about crypto-currencies - she says their underlying technology has ""huge potential to transform payments system and help the unbanked"". But she insists that doesn't tell you anything about the value of the currencies.  She believes that we are in a period when investors are taking a long hard look at what is behind these crypto-assets - and are concluding they may be worthless.",0.10455625,0.01658358134920635
124,'Bitcoin creator': I do not have the courage,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36213588,2016-05-05 13:38:08+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"On Monday, the BBC gave extensive coverage to Craig Wright's claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. The following day, as many in the cryptographic community tore into his claims, he promised further ""extraordinary proof"". But in the last 24 hours, he has first initiated an experiment designed to show that he does possess Satoshi's cryptographic keys, then done an about-turn with a blog saying he ""does not have the courage"" to carry this through. I have always stressed that it was his endorsement by Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen from the Bitcoin Foundation that we found compelling. But now they - and I - have been involved in this failed experiment, which is bound to raise fresh doubts. Here's what happened. On Monday evening, I suggested to Wright's PR firm that if he could send me a fraction of a coin from an early Bitcoin block - which of course I would return - that might show he had Satoshi's keys. But Wright's team came up with a different plan on Wednesday afternoon.  They sent me a draft blog in which he outlined a scheme that would see Matonis, Andresen and the BBC all send small amounts of Bitcoin to the address used in the first ever transaction. Then he would send it back, in what would be the first outgoing transactions from the block since January 2009. We went ahead with our payments - I sent 0.017BTC (about £5), which you can still see in the online records. Matonis and Andresen sent similar amounts.  Then we waited. And waited. Then my phone rang - with the news that the whole operation was ""on hold"", with no reason given. Eighteen hours later we are still waiting for the payments to be made - and now Wright's new blog says that is not going to happen.  I have relied throughout on the expertise of Matonis and Andresen. As of this moment, neither has withdrawn their original statements of support for Wright's case.  Indeed, I understand that Jon Matonis, while concerned at the way events have unfolded, is adamant that he still believes Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto based on other evidence he has seen.",-0.03727894736842105,0.06521132376395535

Craig Wright's spokesman told the BBC that the Australian would ""move a coin from an early block"" known to belong to the crypto-currency's inventor ""in the coming days"". The entrepreneur announced he was behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto on Monday. Critics have said that the evidence produced to date is unconvincing. In a new blog - published after I first wrote this article - Dr Wright said it was right that the public was sceptical about his claims, but added that he would soon present ""extraordinary"" evidence to support his case. ""I will be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim, which will include posting independently-verifiable documents and evidence addressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring bitcoin from an early block,"" he wrote. ""For some there is no burden of proof high enough, no evidence that cannot be dismissed as fabrication or manipulation. This is the nature of belief and swimming against this current would be futile. ""I will present what I believe to be 'extraordinary proof' and ask only that it be independently validated. Ultimately, I can do no more than that."" You can read the strongest attack on Dr Wright in this post on Github, where his original post was described as ""flimflam and hokum which stands up to a few minutes of cursory scrutiny, and demonstrates a competent sysadmin's level of familiarity with cryptographic tools, but ultimately demonstrates no non-public information about Satoshi.""

Bitcoin industry 'sceptical' of Satoshi identity claim Australian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creator The author goes on to speculate that Craig Wright ""used amateur magician tactics to distract non-technical or non-expert staff of the BBC and the Economist during a stage-managed demonstration.""   It's not completely unfair to describe me and Mark Ward - the other BBC reporter at the briefing - as non-technical or non-expert. Indeed, in yesterday's blog I said this: ""What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain."" But what I also said was that Jon Matonis - a senior director at the Bitcoin Foundation - was present at the briefing and actually talked us through the process being demonstrated by Craig Wright. He had told us earlier that he had first suspected Craig was Satoshi last year, after meeting him at a Bitcoin convention in Australia, and in recent weeks had spent a lot of time with him and seen evidence he found compelling. We also knew that the Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen, a respected figure I had interviewed a couple of years ago, was going to say that he believed Craig was Satoshi. On Monday morning, conspiracy theories began to spread that Andresen had been hacked and these were not his views. I explained to a few people that we'd soon know as he was due to speak at a New York conference, and a few hours later up he popped to say, no, he hadn't been hacked, and yes, he was convinced by Craig Wright. The trouble is that Dr Wright's blog has not convinced the wider public. He had told me last week that he intended it to be convoluted. He wanted to show those who doubted his intellectual capabilities that he really knew what he was talking about - instead he has managed to make them more suspicious. This morning, I have managed to reach Jon Matonis, who is at a cryptocurrency event in Kenya. He remains absolutely convinced by Craig Wright but agrees that the blog hasn't helped his case.  ""It needs to be amended because it's not conclusive for the general public. But that does not take away from what I saw in private,"" he explained. As far as I can see it, if Dr Wright can move one of Satoshi's bitcoins - as promised - that should convince many of the doubters.

126,Has Craig Wright proved he's Bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36191165,2016-05-04 11:14:39+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Scepticism has greeted a claim by Craig Wright that he is the inventor of Bitcoin. His claim has been subjected to scrutiny on social media, discussion forums and message boards. Many say the evidence has been found wanting. On 2 May, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of the Bitcoin virtual currency.  In interviews with the BBC, the Economist and GQ, he said he was the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by whoever dreamed up Bitcoin in email exchanges with cryptographers and developers in the early days of the virtual currency.   His claim was backed by Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, and Jon Matonis, an economist and a founding director of the same organisation.  Some. In demonstrations to the Bitcoin experts, the BBC and the Economist, he used the Electrum Bitcoin wallet to sign a message using private keys from early Bitcoin blocks widely assumed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto.  But as the Economist said in its report about Mr Wright, such demonstrations can be ""stage-managed"" and many doubters have said it was poor practice to let him use his own laptop and software of his choosing for this demonstration. However, Mr Andresen's encounter with Mr Wright was more rigorous. In that case, a Windows laptop was bought from a nearby shop, unboxed and the Electrum wallet software installed on it.  Read more: Craig Wright 'to move' Satoshi coin Bitcoin industry 'sceptical' of Satoshi identity claim Australian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creator Mr Wright then signed an arbitrary message - ""Gavin's favorite number is eleven. CSW"" - with a key from an early block. The signed message was put on a USB stick, moved to the new laptop and checked. This revealed the signature to be valid. No. In addition, Mr Wright also posted information on his blog that he said would show that he was Satoshi, again because of the digital signature linked to those early blocks.  Many people jumped on this evidence and soon after revealed that there was no digital signature in it. Instead, it uses a short list of numbers any competent Googler could find. The string of numbers comes from a 2009 bitcoin transaction carried out by Satoshi.  In limbo. On the one hand, we have two key figures in the Bitcoin community convinced Craig Wright is Satoshi. Others have joined them.  On the other, we have a huge number of sceptics utterly unconvinced by evidence that is very weakly linked to Satoshi. Developer Patrick McKenzie pointed out that anyone could use it to claim they were Bitcoin's progenitor. Mr Andresen did entertain the possibility that he has been ""bamboozled"" by an elaborate effort to make the test he saw look more real than it actually was. But, he said, he was still convinced that Craig Wright is Satoshi. With more proof. Many, including the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones, have called on Craig Wright to spend some of the bitcoins locked up in those early blocks to demonstrate that he has control of them.  However, as others have pointed out, all this would show is that he has access to the private keys for these bitcoins, not that he was Satoshi.  Some suggest the confusion around Satoshi's identity has arisen because it was a name adopted by the small group of developers that worked on Bitcoin in its early days. This group involved Mr Wright, Hal Finney and David Kleiman. As the only surviving member of that group Mr Wright could claim to be Satoshi but would not have access to all the data that could be used to definitively prove this assertion.  The Economist has publicly called on Mr Wright to provide more proof. That could soon be forthcoming, said a statement from his PR agency. ""In the coming days Dr Wright will provide further evidence as to him being Satoshi and the creator of Bitcoin by moving a coin from an early block."" Not really. Bitcoin watchers and journalists have been seeking the man behind Satoshi for years. During that time the focus has fallen on Finnish economists, Japanese mathematicians, cybercriminals and Japanese-American physicists. All the people named in those searches have denied being Satoshi. In December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo put forward Craig Wright's name as a potential candidate after receiving documents and emails reportedly stolen from him that showed his involvement with the virtual currency.  After reviewing the evidence, Wired remained unsure, saying:  ""Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did."" We don't know. Critics of Mr Wright point to his continuing dispute with the Australian tax authorities as one reason why he might need a way to explain away his possession of large amounts of bitcoins.  For his part Mr Wright said he is undergoing audits by the Australian Tax Office over the amount of tax he has to pay but this is complicated by the fact that the ATO does not understand bitcoins and how they might be valued. Because Bitcoin has become much more than just a technology project. There is a definite libertarian ideology bound up with it. Some commentators have suggested it is so toxic that it deserves to ""die in a fire"". Also, Bitcoin's community is currently debating how the currency itself should evolve. Some want it to remain a pure net-connected currency but others, including Craig Wright, want it to become a more general payment system. If Mr Wright was confirmed as Satoshi he could lend weight to one side of the debate.  Indeed, he said, during all the years of silence he has not been idle. Instead, he has many ideas about how to expand the reach of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain accounting system. ",-0.04473653846153846,0.09429762945387947
127,Australian Craig Wright claims to be Bitcoin creator,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168863,2016-05-05 14:55:32+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright has publicly identified himself as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. His admission follows years of speculation about who came up with the original ideas underlying the digital cash system. Mr Wright has provided technical proof to back up his claim using coins known to be owned by Bitcoin's creator. Prominent members of the Bitcoin community and its core development team say they have confirmed his claims. But many others in the Bitcoin world are asking for more proof. Mr Wright has revealed his identity to three media organisations - the BBC, the Economist and GQ.  At the meeting with the BBC, Mr Wright digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during the early days of Bitcoin's development. The keys are inextricably linked to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created or ""mined"" by Satoshi Nakamoto. ""These are the blocks used to send 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009] as the first bitcoin transaction,"" said Mr Wright during his demonstration.  Renowned cryptographer Hal Finney was one of the engineers who helped turn Mr Wright's ideas into the Bitcoin protocol, he said. ""I was the main part of it, but other people helped me,"" he said. Soon after Mr Wright went public, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a blog backing his claim. ""I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin,"" he wrote. Jon Matonis, an economist and one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, said he was convinced that Mr Wright was who he claimed to be.  ""During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical,"" he said. ""It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three categories."" Mr Wright said he planned to release information that would allow others to cryptographically verify that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  Not everyone has been convinced by Mr Wright's claims and the technical proof he put in his blog. Some cryptographers and developers who worked through the information provided said they had trouble getting verifiable information out of it.  Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the procedure was almost ""maliciously resistant"" to validation. Many people have called on Mr Wright to go further in proving his identify. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.  There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned. By going public, Mr Wright hopes to put an end to press speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The New Yorker, Fast Company, Newsweek and many other media organisations have all conducted long investigations seeking Bitcoin's creator and named many different people as candidates.  In December 2015, two magazines, Wired and Gizmodo, named Mr Wright as a candidate after receiving documents believed to be stolen from him that revealed his involvement with the project.  Soon after these stories were published, authorities in Australia raided the home of Mr Wright. The Australian Taxation Office said the raid was linked to a long-running investigation into tax payments rather than Bitcoin.  Questioned about this raid, Mr Wright said he was cooperating fully with the ATO.  ""We have lawyers negotiating with them over how much I have to pay,"" he said.  The stories in December have led to many more journalists and others pursuing him and people he knows, he said.  ""There are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don't like it hurting those people I care about,"" he said. ""I don't want any of them to be impacted by this."" ""I have not done this because it is what I wanted. It's not because of my choice,"" he said, adding that he had no plans to become the figurehead for bitcoins. ""I really do not want to be the public face of anything,"" he said, expressing regret that he had been forced to reveal his identity.  ""I would rather not do it,"" he said. ""I want to work, I want to keep doing what I want to do. I don't want money. I don't want fame. I don't want adoration. I just want to be left alone."" Bitcoins are now accepted as payment for a vast variety of goods and services - everything from international money transfers to ransoms for data encrypted by computer viruses. There are currently about 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation. Each one is worth about $449 (£306).  Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about one million Bitcoins which would give him a net worth, if all were converted to cash, of about $450m. 5 May 2016: Clarification The original headline and text of this story was changed on the day of publication (2 May 2016).

Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, where many users had stored the virtual currency to be used in transactions, said it lost up to $65m (£49m) in an attack. The impact of the loss will now be shared across the site's users. One Bitcoin expert said the move to ""socialise"" losses had serious implications for digital currencies. ""Anyone who holds any asset at any exchange realises they're part of the insurance plan for others,"" said Emin Gun Sirer at Cornell University. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said, ""We have decided to generalise losses across all accounts. ""Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalised loss percentage of 36.067%.""  More details of how this figure was reached would be published in the future, the firm added. Customers were also told that they would receive a ""BFX token"" equal to their personal losses. These tokens will eventually be exchanged either for repayment by Bitfinex or for shares in its parent company iFinex Inc. Bitfinex has said that a total of 119,756 bitcoins were taken by hackers. In May 2015, 1,500 bitcoins were stolen in a previous attack on the exchange. It is not the first exchange to have suffered. Many users lost large caches of bitcoins after they disappeared from the Mt Gox exchange, which then declared bankruptcy in 2014. Following the news that Bitfinex had suffered a substantial loss of bitcoins, the price of the cryptocurrency fell by more than 20% - though it has since rebounded slightly. ""It's going to be rough,"" Dr Sirer told the BBC. ""I think we're going to see a move towards models with better understood insurance."" The ""vast majority"" of people held bitcoins in exchanges and online wallets, according to security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. ""It's a bit like your bank account having money taken from it and then your bank writing to all customers saying it will spread the losses across all of them,"" he told the BBC.",-0.1943764705882353,0.09470121381886087

Craig Wright had pledged to move some of the virtual currency from one of its early address blocks, an act many believe can only be done by the tech's creator. This would have addressed complaints that earlier evidence he had published online was misleading. Dr Wright said that he was ""sorry"". ""I believed that I could put years of anonymity and hiding behind me,"" he blogged. ""But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot. ""When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this."" Dr Wright's claims were first reported by the BBC, the Economist and GQ magazine on Monday. Dr Wright had earlier indicated that he would transfer some bitcoins from ""block 9"" by using a private key thought to be known only to Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym used by the person or team that designed the crypto-currency. Satoshi is known to have used the address in 2009 to send coins to a computer scientist. Dr Wright had promised the ""extraordinary proof"" in light of a growing backlash against one of his blogs. On Monday, he had posted what seemed to be evidence that he had Satoshi's key by describing a process that led to the creation of a ""digital signature"". But soon after, this was attacked by security researchers who linked the signature to an earlier Satoshi Bitcoin transaction that could be found via a search engine. Dr Wright subsequently wrote that he was the victim of ""false allegations"" and would prove his case by both moving the coins and by sharing ""independently verifiable documents"". Dr Wright's claims had initially been bolstered by the fact that two senior members of the Bitcoin Foundation - an organisation set up to protect and promote the virtual currency - had said they were convinced he was indeed behind the technology. Dr Wright had shown Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis other evidence in private. He apologised to the two men in his latest blog. ""I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen,"" he wrote. ""I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I'm sorry. And goodbye."" Mr Matonis has tweeted that there ""won't be another Satoshi"". The BBC understands that this tweet signifies that Mr Matonis still believes Dr Wright is indeed Satoshi. ""A lot more people in the Bitcoin community are going to be unconvinced of Dr Wright's claims than will believe he is Satoshi, based upon what's happened to date,"" commented Dr Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""But many of the doubters don't want to be convinced. Satoshi has been mythologised and if you pull back the curtain, you shatter a lot of people's fantasies. ""There are very credible people besides Gavin and Jon who still think he is Satoshi - people who are privy to other information and whose judgement I respect. ""But personally, I have more questions than answers at this point."" Security researcher Dan Kaminsky was more sceptical. ""I'm glad it's over,"" he said. ""I can't believe Wright's last scheme was to demand £5 be sent to the real Satoshi. I wouldn't call that courage but it's definitely chutzpah.""

131,Quadriga: The cryptocurrency exchange that lost $135m,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47203706,2019-02-17 00:41:33+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc," When the 30-year-old founder of a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange died suddenly, he took the whereabouts of some C$180m ($135m; £105m) in cryptocurrency to his grave. Now, tens of thousands of Quadriga CX users are wondering if they will ever see their funds again.  In 2014, one of the world's biggest online cryptocurrency exchanges - MtGox - unexpectedly shut down after losing 850,000 Bitcoins valued at the time at nearly $0.4bn (£0.3bn). Its meltdown shook investors in the volatile emerging marketplace - but the calamity at the Tokyo-based company proved a boon for a new Canadian online cryptocurrency exchange.  ""People like the fact we're located in Canada and know where their money is going,"" Quadriga CX founder Gerald Cotten said at the time.  Some five years later, Cotten's sudden, untimely death has left thousands of his customers scrambling for information about their own missing funds.  ""We don't know whether or not we're going to get our money back,"" Tong Zou, who says he is owed C$560,000 - his life savings - told the BBC.  ""There's just a lot of uncertainty.""   This month, Quadriga - which had grown to become Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange - was granted temporary bankruptcy protection in a Canadian court.  The firm said it had spent the weeks since Cotten's death trying desperately to ""locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves"".  In court documents, Quadriga says it owes up to 115,000 users an estimated C$250m - about C$70m in hard currency and between C$180m an C$190m in cryptocurrency, based on recent market rates.  It believes - though it's not certain - that the bulk of those millions in reserves was locked away by Cotten in cold storage, which is an offline safeguard against hacking and theft. For now, all trading has been suspended on the platform.  Bernie Doyle, CEO of Refine Labs and head of the Toronto chapter of the Government Blockchain Association, calls what's happening at Quadriga a ""seismic event"" in the industry.  The world of digital currency has little regulatory oversight and a history of volatile prices, hacking threats, and minimal consumer protection.  Mr Doyle says this only adds to the nascent sector's already ""checkered history"".  But he says ""it's really unfortunate that the ecosystem takes a hit"" amid one firm's problems.  Court documents filed in late January offer some insight into the company.   Quadriga had no offices, no employees and no bank accounts. It was essentially a one-man band run entirely by Cotten wherever he - and his laptop - happened to be, which was usually his home in Fall River, Nova Scotia.  It used some third-party contractors to handle some of the additional work, including payment processing.  His widow, Jennifer Robertson, says she was not involved in the company until her husband died suddenly on 9 December in India from complications related to Crohn's disease.  In an affidavit, she says she has searched the couple's home and other properties for business records related to Quadriga, to no avail. The laptop on which he conducted all the business is encrypted and she doesn't have the password or recovery key.   An investigator hired to assist in recovering any records had little success.   It was also recently revealed the company somehow inadvertently transferred Bitcoins valued at almost half-a-million dollars into cold storage in early February and now can't access them.  But Quadriga's troubles didn't start with missing coins. The company's liquidity problems began months earlier.  In January 2018, Canadian bank CIBC froze five accounts containing about C$26m linked to Quadriga's payment processor in a dispute over the real owners of the funds, an issue that ended up in court.  The company says it also has millions in bank drafts it has been unable to deposit because banks have been unwilling to accept them.  Ms Robertson's affidavit to the court included photos showing stacks of bank drafts placed on a kitchen stove.  Those banking disputes contributed to a ""severe liquidity crunch"" at the company, with frustrated users facing delays and difficulties trying to access funds. In photos and interviews, Cotten comes across as a clean-cut business school graduate who tended to favour the casual shirts and jeans uniform of a tech entrepreneur.  In a statement, Quadriga called him a ""visionary leader"" who was in India for the opening an orphanage for children in need when he died.  His friend Alex Salkeld described Cotten as a helpful, easy-going young man keen to contribute to the community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  ""I don't think you'll find anyone willing to say anything bad about him,"" he told the BBC.  Mr Salkeld said once a week Vancouver Bitcoin Co-Op members would all head over to the Quadriga's then-offices ""and just talk Bitcoin"".  Like others at the time, he said Cotten saw Bitcoin as a technology with the potential to change the world - a virtual currency free of governments and the banking system.  Mr Salkeld said that since Cotten died, those who knew him have been going back-and-forth over how he could possibly have failed to have a contingency plan in place.  But amid rampant talk online about possible fraud related to the missing coins, Mr Salkeld said that, to him, ""it's looking like a tragic series of unfortunate events strung together in a really unlucky way"".  Cotten's last will and testament also gives some hints as to his life and assets.  The document, signed shortly before his ill-fated trip to India, shows he appointed Ms Robertson as executor of the estate and left her the bulk of his property.  It offers some detail into those assets: a Lexus, an airplane - he was an amateur pilot - a sailboat, and real estate in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and British Columbia.  He even planned for the care of his two chihuahuas, Nitro and Gully.  There are many who are suspicious of Quadriga's story and who doubt claims that Cotten had the only key to reserves valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  Online sleuths and industry experts have analysed the public transaction history of Quadriga wallets - which are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency - and have raised the possibility that the cold storage reserves might not exist at all.  That has led to concern there is more at play than poor business practices and internal company chaos in the wake of Cotten's death.  Others have wondered whether Cotten faked his own death and that this is all part of an ""exit scam"" to abscond with the funds.  Amid those rumours, Ms Robertson's affidavit included a copy of statement of death from a funeral home in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  The hospital in Jaipur where Cotten was treated also released a statement detailing the medical interventions he received prior to his death.  His widow says she has received death threats and ""slanderous comments"" online since Quadriga publicly announced its troubles.  An independent third party monitor has also been appointed to oversee the court proceedings, and is currently in possession of Cotten's laptop and other devices.  In an online message to its users, Quadriga said it filed for creditor protection to give it time to ensure the future viability of the company.  It also admitted it is in ""the early stages of a long process and [does] not have all the answers right now"".  According to court filings, Quadriga is also investigating whether some of the cryptocurrency could be secured on other exchanges and it said it's considering selling the platform to cover its debts. A number of affected users, including Tong Zou, have retained lawyers and are seeking representation in the proceedings.  Meanwhile, Canada's main securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, has confirmed it looking into Quadriga ""given the potential harm to Ontario investors"".

132,Government urged to use Bitcoin-style digital ledgers,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35344843,2016-01-19 13:05:36+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The UK's chief scientific adviser has urged the government to adopt the technology that powers crypto-currency Bitcoin to run various public services.  Bitcoins are powered by blockchains - digital ledgers that record information from Bitcoin transactions to DNA. Sir Mark Walport has argued that they could be used by government departments as a more secure way of managing data. They could be used to help with tax collection, benefits or the issuing of passports, he has said. Blockchains consist of ""blocks"" of data in a digital ledger. Copies of these ledgers are shared by all the computers that access them, meaning they are distributed across the network. Because blockchains act as permanent records of every time that data is added to them - and because private blockchains allow access to specific users only - they are thought to be highly resistant to malicious tampering. Sir Mark's recommendation comes in the form of a new report which advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of services.  ""Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services,"" the report says. ""In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely, according to exact rules."" Sir Mark added that existing approaches to data management in government departments typically involved large centralised systems with ""a high cost single point of failure"". These systems may also be more vulnerable to hacking or errors, he wrote. Using distributed ledgers and storing multiple copies of them is something that has helped been made possible by the improvement in computing technology, according to Dave Birch, at consultants Consult Hyperion. ""I think the report is really interesting,"" he told the BBC. However, Mr Birch added that he was initially unsure of why blockchains - specific types of ledgers that require users to agree on the state of their contents - would be useful. ""When you say 'blockchain', that's a very specific kind of consensus protocol and one of the key reasons for using that is because there may be people trying to subvert [the data],"" he said. ""I can see the report talks about distributed ledger technology in general. The issue is, can distributed ledgers help in certain kinds of government ledgers - the answer is almost certainly yes."" The report suggests that the British government should begin trials of distributed ledger technology to see how usable it is. Some countries have already taken the step. Texas-based firm Factom announced last year that it was working with Honduras to build a blockchain record of land registry titles - though the project later appeared to be on hiatus. The report notes another example, Estonia, which already uses distributed ledger technology for citizens to check the integrity of their records on government databases.",0.23653,0.08204172679172679
133,US charges Iranian ‘SamSam’ hackers,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46381033,2018-11-29 00:15:18+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The hacking attack was said to have lasted for 34 months, holding schools, hospitals, universities in several countries to ransom -  earning the perpetrators millions of dollars in the process. Now US prosecutors have charged two Iranians they believe were behind the attack - though justice is perhaps unlikely. “Although the alleged criminal actors are in Iran and currently out of the reach of US law enforcement,” the FBI said, “they can be apprehended if they travel, and the United States is exploring other avenues of recourse.” They are accused of carrying out a ransomware attack - malicious software that locks files and systems and demands a fee to unlock them. “The allegations in the indictment unsealed today - the first of its kind - outline an Iran-based international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in a 21st-Century digital blackmail,” said US assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski on Wednesday. Additionally, two other Iranians were sanctioned by the US Treasury for facilitating the exchange of Bitcoin into Iran’s currency, the rial.  'Take control' The scheme is said to have cost around 230 victims more than $30m (£23m) as they struggled to work around the shutdown of their systems. Court documents named 12, including a Hollywood hospital that had to turn away patients in early 2016.  Elsewhere in the US, the city of Atlanta saw five different government departments infected with the ransomware, known as SamSam. It meant residents were unable to pay utility bills, and police officers reverted to paper-based reports. There were other victims in the UK and Canada, the FBI said. “To execute the SamSam ransomware attack, cyber actors exploit computer network vulnerabilities to gain access and copy the SamSam ransomware into the network. “Once in the network, these cyber actors use the SamSam ransomware to gain administrator rights that allow them to take control of a victim’s servers and files, without the victim’s authorisation.   “The cyber actors then demand a ransom be paid in bitcoin in order for a victim to regain access and control of its own network.” The FBI said two men - Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri - were responsible for deploying the ransomware which, although notable for its impact, was considered by security experts to be unremarkable in its design.  As is often the case with ransomware attacks, the efficacy was more likely strengthened by poorly maintained, out-of-date computer systems, rather than the sophistication or determination of the attackers. New sanctions Perhaps more significant in this case is the US Treasury’s decision to impose sanctions on two more men - Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan - who were said to have helped the criminals convert the ransom money, which was paid in digital currency Bitcoin, into “real” money - the Iranian rial. The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control specified two accounts used to send and receive funds - known as Bitcoin wallets - that it said were associated with the accused.  It means if a Bitcoin trading platform facilitates a transaction to either account, it could face severe penalties, including being blocked from operating in the US. The Treasury said it was the first time it had marked specific digital currency as being linked to sanctioned individuals. Due to the nature of digital currency, however, the accused could of course avoid the restrictions by simply using a different wallet not yet known to authorities.________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Senator Philip Ozouf announced the new legislation at the island's first finance technology conference. The government has been working on the legislation for about 18 months and focused on protecting against money laundering and financial crime. Virtual currency companies will face tighter regulation as they grow. John Harris from the Jersey Financial Services Commission said they would not have to pay a fee or face tougher regulation until they had an annual turnover of £150,000. Robbie Andrews, who founded a group to campaign for Bitcoin regulation, said there were already companies waiting to move to Jersey. He said: ""The fact that the government has taken a light-touch approach where other jurisdictions have gone all-encompassing with regulation will be a benefit to Jersey."" Mr Harris said when looking at the regulation they had to be careful about the risk to the finance industry. Bitcoin expert Dave Birch said Jersey was right to focus on regulation, as it was the area where it could have a competitive edge. He said: ""The barriers most of the companies we work with come from the regulatory environment.  ""Everybody can access Bitcoins and it is hard to see how you can get a competitive advantage when you don't have the same scale as other areas such as Silicon Valley. ""Where Jersey has an advantage is being able to connect the regulatory environment to those new key technologies.""

Craig Wright announced on Monday that he was behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by Bitcoin's creator. The same day, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote he was ""convinced beyond a reasonable doubt"" of Dr Wright's case. But Mr Andresen said he now thinks it was a ""mistake"" to have posted. The expert had written that he had privately witnessed Dr Wright using cryptographic keys that ""only Satoshi should possess"". But critics called Dr Wright's claim into doubt when it emerged that part of the evidence the entrepreneur presented in public could have been generated using a string of digits linked to a seven-year-old transaction made by Satoshi, accessible via a search engine. ""It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his - I assumed his post would simply be a signed message anybody could easily verify,"" Mr Andresen told security researcher Dan Kaminsky when he challenged the scientist over the matter. ""Of course he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some bitcoins through the key associated with an early block."" Mr Andresen has yet to update his blog to reflect this change of view. Dr Wright has promised to present further ""extraordinary proof""  including ""independently-verifiable documents"" and the transfer of a bitcoin from one of the virtual currency's early blocks, which Satoshi would have access to. At this point, he still has the backing of Jon Matonis - the Bitcoin Foundation's founding director - who has said he has ""no doubt"" that Dr Wright is responsible for the Bitcoin technology. But Mr Kaminsky said he now disbelieved Dr Wright's claims bearing in mind Mr Andresen's own doubts. ""Gavin is making no excuses for Wright,"" Mr Kaminsky told the BBC, ""I don't expect Wright to deliver on his lofty promises, but I also don't expect him to go away.   ""Some people just like negotiating with reality."" Dr Wright has said he does not plan to give any further interviews. But in his most recent blog he noted: ""For some there is no burden of proof high enough, no evidence that cannot be dismissed as fabrication or manipulation. This is the nature of belief and swimming against this current would be futile."" Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned. Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin. In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin ""mining"". Users have a ""bitcoin address"", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used. Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts. Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead.",-0.009620000000000012,0.08304166666666667

Shaun Bridges took $820,000 (£546,000) in bitcoin after accessing Silk Road. He admitted money laundering and obstruction charges in August. US District Judge Richard Seeborg said Bridges' behaviour was a ""shocking and reprehensible abandonment of his public duty"". Passing sentence on Monday, the judge said ""This, to me, is an extremely serious crime consisting of the betrayal of public trust by a federal law enforcement agent,"" the AP reported. ""And from everything I see, it was motivated entirely by greed."" As a member of the US Secret Service, Bridges was part of a task force investigating the Silk Road marketplace, which was used by some to trade illegal items. It was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies. Having gained access to the online bazaar, Bridges stole the online currency and tried to pin it on a witness who was cooperating with the investigation, prompting Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht to take out hits on the witness' life, prosecutors said at Monday's hearing. The judge said it was ""inexcusable"" for a federal agent to put a cooperating witness at risk in that way. Bridges told the judge before his sentencing that he had accepted responsibility for his crime and had not spent any of the money he took. ""I obviously have lost a lot, a very illustrious career,"" he said. His lawyer sought a three-year sentence, but the judge gave him a jail term of five years and 11 months, the AP reported. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in May after he was convicted over his operation of the website for nearly three years from 2011 until his 2013 arrest. Prosecutors said he collected $18m in bitcoin through commissions on tens of thousands of drug sales while operating the site using the alias, ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" an apparent reference to a main character in ""The Princess Bride,"" the 1987 comedy film based on a novel of the same name.

Nine banks, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs, may adopt the blockchain system that logs who spends which virtual coins in an ever-expanding computer equivalent of a ledger. The banks want to use the blockchain method because it is hard to fool - making fraud more difficult. It could also speed up trading systems and make deals more transparent.  The project to test blockchain-like technology is being led by financial technology firm R3 which has signed nine banks up to the initiative. The other seven are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Technical meetings with the banks had prompted discussion of how it could be used within banks' trading arms, said David Rutter, head of R3 in an interview with Reuters. For Bitcoin, the blockchain acts as a globally-distributed ledger that logs transactions. Everyone involved with the virtual currency contributes to the way the blockchain verifies each deal. The sheer number of people involved makes it very hard for one bitcoin user to get fraudulent deals verified and approved. Despite this, Bitcoin has been hit by a series of scandals and thefts although most of these came about because hackers exploited weaknesses on exchanges where coins are traded or in digital wallets where they are held. Mr Rutter said the banks were most interested in the technical architecture underpinning the blockchain that could be adapted for their own ends. The first place the blockchain was likely to find a role was as a log of who bought which stocks or shares, he said.  By adopting the technology banks could cut the cost of reporting transactions and working out who bought what and when, he added.

GAW Miners and ZenMiner are accused of selling shares worth $20m (£13.3m) in mining hardware called Hashlets. Bitcoins are ""mined"" when computers solve equations that verify user transactions made with the currency. But it is claimed that Hashlets did not have enough processing power to carry out the number of verifications required to properly reward investors. GAW and ZenMiner were owned by Homero Joshua Garza, who has been charged in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint filed in a federal court in Connecticut.  ""As alleged in our complaint, Garza and his companies cloaked their scheme in technological sophistication and jargon, but the fraud was simple at its core: they sold what they did not own, misrepresented what they were selling, and robbed one investor to pay another,"" said Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's Boston regional office.  The SEC has alleged that Mr Garza's companies were engaged in what's known as a Ponzi scheme, in which investors were owed more than the mining machines were able to make and pay out to them each day. As a result, it is claimed that most were never able to recoup the value of their initial investments, while a few made some profit. Mr Garza was said to be ""disappointed"" by the charges, according to a statement from his lawyer, Marjorie Peerce,  Any further comments, she added, would be made through the court process.

Teachers at the school in Hunan became suspicious of a whirring noise that continued day and night, local media report. This led to the discovery of the machines, which were mining the crypto-currency Ethereum. They racked up an electricity bill of 14,700 yuan (£1,600).  The excessive electricity consumption had previously been reported to the headmaster, Lei Hua, but he reportedly dismissed it as being caused by air conditioners and heating devices. Mining crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum involves connecting computers, usually specialised ""mining machines"", to the currency network. By providing computing power for validating transactions on that network, mining-machine owners are rewarded with newly generated coins, making it a potentially lucrative exercise - especially when done at scale. In this case, a total of eight mining machines were installed in the Hunan school's computer room between summer 2017 and summer 2018. The headmaster had originally spent 10,000 yuan on a single machine for use at home, but allegedly decided to move it to the school after he saw how much electricity it consumed. The deputy headmaster also became involved in the scheme and allegedly acquired a ninth machine for himself in January, which was also installed at the school. The computer network in the building became overloaded as a result of the mining activity, according to reports, and this ""interfered"" with teaching.

142,Bitcoin's baby: Blockchain's 'tamper-proof' revolution,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32781244,2015-05-19 23:26:24+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"For Bitcoin, 2014 was not a good year. The virtual currency's value slumped as scandal after scandal struck, resulting in many people losing significant amounts of money.  Over recent months the ""cryptocurrency"" has stabilised, however it is still worth less than a quarter of its peak value against the dollar. But while Bitcoin's long-term prospects may remain in doubt, some are suggesting that its underlying technology - the Blockchain - has a bright future. Blockchain businesses take the technology that underpins Bitcoin - the Blockchain - and use it for things the virtual currency's unidentified creator, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", never envisaged when he first published his system for a ""truly peer-to-peer electronic cash system"".  In Bitcoin, the Blockchain is used to store financial transactions.  The emerging Blockchain companies believe it can be used for much more. The new projects have been dubbed ""Bitcoin 2.0"" - but some Blockchain evangelists are wary of the term because of negative associations with Bitcoin. In Bitcoin the Blockchain is a ledger.  Imagine walking into the head office of a bank some 80 years ago. Arranged along shelves are a number of hefty, leather-bound books.  You take one down, blow the dust from the cover and open it up. This is the ledger, and each page contains a number of lines, and on each line is listed a transaction: a credit here, a debit there.  The Blockchain is simply a representation of this ledger in the form of an ever-expanding computer file. You can think of a block in the Blockchain representing a page in the ledger.  Other characteristics of the  Blockchain are: The uncoordinated nature of the network is what keeps it honest.  To corrupt the system - in other words to hack it - you would have to commandeer more than 50% of the computers on the system. More on this later. It does.  ""Blockchain bloat"" is a problem the Bitcoin community is already trying to address.  At the time of writing, the current size of the Blockchain is a touch under 36GB.  For comparisons sake, that's more storage than many smartphones provide, and enough to fill more than 50 standard CD-Roms. Just about any kind of data you can think of that is transactional in nature and requires immutability - ie information that absolutely cannot be changed after it has been created. A good example is land titles.  Texas-based Factom is working with a Central American client to try to get their system for registering land titles into a Blockchain.  According to Factom president Peter Kirby, this country had ""built a database of all their land title records and some bureaucrats got hold of that and they started giving themselves beachfront property"". He added: ""With Blockchain technology, you could create a truly tamper-proof record system. Those land title records can go into the Blockchain in a way that I know if anybody tries to change it."" Other candidates for insertion into the Blockchain include contracts, royalty payments, certificates for authenticating art and even government budgets. Can I look at a Blockchain? Yes you can.  You can download the Bitcoin Blockchain at any time and view transactions in near real-time.  Alternatively visit  www.blockexplorer.com and use its simplified interface. Just type in a random block number to view the transactions contained within that block. Sure is.  And for many this is the most crucial point of all: the Blockchain lacks a central, controlling authority. With banks, it's the bank that acts as the sole arbiter of the validity of the ledger.  With land, it's the officials controlling the registry.  Both are examples of what techies are fond of calling a single point of failure.  Anti-corruption group Transparency International says there is great potential in a Blockchain's ability to bypass the need for such traditional ""gatekeepers"". ""Corruption appears when you have a monopoly, somebody with discretionality to decide and when you have opacity,"" Alejandro Sales, the body's regional director for the Americas tells the BBC. Not so fast.  The Blockchain's distributed nature and the ability for anyone in the world with a powerful enough computer to participate is both its strength and weakness.  According to the theory, so long as nodes - programs that validate transactions and blocks - don't cooperate to break the system, all goes to plan. But when it comes to putting all this into practice, one Harvard internet law professor thinks he has spotted a flaw. ""Why would we assume that now and forever no one entity could command more than half of the computing power of the people mining a Blockchain?"" asks Prof Jonathan Zittrain. ""I haven't really heard a satisfying answer to that.""",0.05034888888888889,0.08442015392015392
143,Japan court rules against Bitcoin compensation plea,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33816664,2015-08-07 11:35:05+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A Japanese court has ruled against a man hoping to claim compensation over lost bitcoins, saying the virtual currency cannot be owned. The Kyoto man lost 458 bitcoins worth around 31 million yen (£160,000) following the collapse of the MtGox exchange last year. But the Tokyo District Court said the currency was ""not subject to ownership"". Consequently, the lawsuit seeking repayment was dismissed. The judge in the case, Masumi Kurachi, ruled that the Japanese law only allowed for proprietorship of tangible entities that occupy space and which allow for exclusive control over them. As such, the virtual currency could not be owned. An example given by the judge was that transactions between users must involve a third party and therefore exclusive control over bitcoins was not possible. The MtGox exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February last year and reported that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins worth about £240m at the time. Ever since, users whose bitcoins disappeared have been attempting to stand up legal cases in order to gain some form of compensation. A class-action lawsuit in North America over the MtGox catastrophe was settled out of court last year, for example. Recently, the former CEO of MtGox, Mark Karpeles was arrested in connection with the lost bitcoins. Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn told the BBC he was a little surprised by the Tokyo court's ruling but added that there was still a great deal of confusion over the legal status of Bitcoin in many nations. ""What's we've seen a bunch of times is different governments in different parts of the world coming to different conclusions about Bitcoin,"" he said. He commented that compensation claims over MtGox were unlikely to get anywhere, even with judicial endorsement. ""It's quite obvious that MtGox doesn't have the money so where these compensation claims would be paid from is not clear,"" he explained. Mr Hearn also said that the looming question mark over Bitcoin was beginning to harm the growth of the virtual currency. ""One of the biggest and most common reasons especially for more established companies to say, 'we're not getting into Bitcoin', is regulatory uncertainty,"" he said.",-0.010605882352941172,0.02740196078431372
144,"Bitcoin creator 'is 44-year-old Australian', claims Wired",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35047596,2015-12-09 00:00:33+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"You may remember Newsweek creating headlines around the world when it ""outed"" the creator of digital currency Bitcoin as being a 64-year-old Japanese American living near Los Angeles.  The magazine said it had found the mysterious ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", the man whose name has been linked with the creation of the currency.  That ""scoop"" apparently proved false - Dorian Nakamoto (birth name Satoshi) ended up suing Newsweek after he said his life was turned completely upside down.  And so it is with that rigmarole still fresh in our minds that I tentatively offer this article from Wired which says Bitcoin creator ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" is a pseudonym used by a 44-year-old Australian cryptologist named Craig Steven Wright. ""Either Wright invented bitcoin,"" Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwen Branwen write, ""Or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.""  Bitcoin is a virtual currency built around a complicated cryptographic protocol and a global network of computers that oversees and verifies which coins have been spent by whom. Its anonymous nature means it is a popular choice for criminal activity as it is extremely difficult to trace who is spending Bitcoin.   The currency's creator (or creators, perhaps) is proving just as difficult to trace.  Wired cite leaked documents it says shows communication between Dr Wright and his lawyers in which he is reported to have said: ""I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.  ""By the end of this I think half the world is going to bloody know.""  I've tried to reach Dr Wright, but to no avail. His blog was taken offline shortly after Wired published its report, while Dr Wright's Twitter account went from being protected to being deleted altogether.  According to the online profiles that remain online, he runs DeMorgan Ltd, a Sydney-based company that looks at ""alternative currency"".  For the full break down of Wired's body of research into Dr Wright, I urge you to read their full article. But it can be summed up as:  - Blog posts apparently published well before the launch of Bitcoin sharing and seeking expertise on creating cryptocurrencies.  - A request for people to email him details by using an encrypted key previously linked to someone identifying themselves as being Satoshi Nakamoto.  - A post announcing the launch of Bitcoin that was later deleted and replaced with a note saying ""the best way to hide is right in the open"".  Furthermore, leaked emails and transcripts back up what the magazine says - pointing to Dr Wright having huge stashes of Bitcoins, which he among other things used to invest in setting up a Bitcoin bank.  But, and it's a big but, Wired is quick to pre-emptively point out the potential holes in its theory - saying it could be a very elaborate hoax.  ""The unverified leaked documents could have been faked in whole or in part,"" the magazine said.  But later adds: ""But this much is clear: If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as bitcoin itself.""  The body of evidence presented is certainly compelling, and fills in many of the holes not covered by other supposed outings of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who is fast becoming something of a Lord Lucan for the digital world.

145,Silk Road: Undercover agent admits stealing Bitcoin,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33364349,2015-07-02 11:38:55+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A former US undercover agent involved in an investigation into the dark web marketplace Silk Road has admitted a series of crimes. Carl Force, 46, faces up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of extortion, money-laundering and obstruction of justice. He stole more than $700,000 (£448,000) in the digital currency Bitcoin. Force also secretly solicited payment from the marketplace's operator for information about the US investigation. During the course of the investigation, the former US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent posed as a drug dealer with connections to hit-men using the alias Nob. He was given the task of communicating with Ross Ulbricht, the man who was subsequently jailed for life for running Silk Road, prosecutors said. According to a government document, Force convinced Ulbricht, who went by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, to pay him $50,000 in Bitcoin by pretending he had information about the investigation in August 2013. While Force reported the discussion to the DEA, he falsely claimed no payment had been made, while diverting the funds to a personal account, prosecutors said. Force, also without the authorities' knowledge, used another online moniker French Maid and offered Ulbricht information on the investigation for about $98,000 in Bitcoin in September that year. He appeared in a San Francisco federal court on Wednesday wearing an orange jumpsuit and leg shackles. Among the crimes he confessed to, Force said he had agreed to a contract with 21st Century Fox last year to help make a film about the Silk Road investigation, without the permission of his supervisors. That deal called for him to be paid up to $240,000. The firm has not responded to a request for comment. Force also invested in a company that brokered Bitcoin and served as its chief compliance officer while still with the DEA. During his time with the company, Force used his position to seize $300,000 from a customer and transfer it to his private account, authorities said. US district judge Richard Seeborg accepted Force's guilty plea on Wednesday and scheduled his sentencing for October. Speaking outside court, Force's lawyer Ivan Bates said: ""He had a stellar, 15-year career with the DEA except for this one blip."" Inside the court, Bates said his client suffered from anxiety and depression. Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214m in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using Bitcoin, prosecutors said. Ulbricht was himself sentenced in May after a federal jury in Manhattan found him guilty of several charges, including distributing drugs using the internet. Prosecutors have also reached a plea agreement with Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent who was charged along with Force in March with stealing Bitcoin during the investigation. He is scheduled to enter his plea in August. A lawyer for Ulbricht has said those charges removed ""any question about the corruption that pervaded the investigation of Silk Road"". Force and Bridges belonged to the same Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road.",-0.13117391304347828,-0.07696256038647344

Japanese police arrested Mr Karpeles in Tokyo, where he lives, on 1 August.  His arrest was connected to the MtGox loss of 850,000 Bitcoins in February 2014. At the time, the losses were worth nearly $400m (about £240m). It was claimed the Bitcoin losses were caused by a bug - but the Tokyo-based exchange later filed for bankruptcy. MtGox then said it had found some 200,000 of the lost bitcoins. Mr Karpeles has also been accused of falsifying data and improperly transferring MtGox funds. The French-born former chief executive of the exchange had been held in detention for six weeks without being formally charged, which is allowed under Japanese law.  It was not clear if the embezzlement charge was related to all or some of the missing money. Japan's Kyodo News said in August that a lawyer acting on Mr Karpeles' behalf denied his client had done anything illegal.

147,Twitter: Fake Elon Musk scam spreads after accounts hacked,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46097853,2018-11-05 19:11:28+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Several popular verified Twitter accounts have been hacked by scammers to promote an ad using Tesla boss Elon Musk's name and likeness. British fashion retailer Matalan, film distributor Pathe UK and US publisher Pantheon Books were among those whose accounts were taken over by scam artists. The scam used promoted tweets - where Twitter is paid by advertisers to make a tweet appear to a wider audience. The tweets have since been deleted with many accounts recovered, though some were left blank while waiting for their owners to re-enter their name and profile picture. Scammers targeted several ""verified"" accounts (denoted with a blue tick) and changed the name and image to that of Mr Musk. The tweet then urged users to part with a small amount of Bitcoin - a digital currency - to supposedly receive more.  Several other verified accounts, which were also taken under the scam artists' control, appear in the tweet's comments to claim that they have received Bitcoin from Mr Musk. A Twitter spokesperson told the BBC it ""doesn't comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons"".  By using accounts with Twitter's own verification mark (a blue tick), it makes the account appear legitimate at first glance and thus may fool the reader into thinking it is official. But many of the posts still bear the hallmarks of classic scams - including frequent spelling errors (see ""Bitcoic"" and ""suppoot"" in the above tweet) and a request for money. The account handle itself is also incorrect - a legitimate tweet from Elon Musk would read @elonmusk beside the blue tick. In this case, it reads @patheuk - as the account originally belonged to film distributor Pathe UK. Clicking on any of the links in the scam sends users to a page where they are urged to send anywhere from 0.1-one Bitcoin (£491-£4,491) to the scammers - with the promise that they would receive one-10 Bitcoin as a reward. Victims do not receive any Bitcoin after sending money to the scam artists. The scam is made to seem more trustworthy as various other compromised accounts reply to the tweet claiming that it works. For example, the above tweet would appear to have been praised by verified accounts like boxer Rayton Okwiri, blogger Sarah Scoop, and Swansea City AFC Ladies. The scam tweet has been posted by several verified accounts on Twitter. British fashion retailer Matalan, film distributor Pathe UK and US publisher Pantheon Books were among those whose accounts were reset after the hack. Pathe UK have since issued a statement to confirm that their account was ""hacked by an unknown third party"". An early form of the scam was first spotted in March when accounts appeared simply using Mr Musk's name and likeness to ask for Bitcoin. It became so frequent on the social network that the Tesla chief was briefly blocked from his own Twitter account after he parodied the scam by sending a tweet asking: ""Wanna buy some Bitcoin?"". Now the scam has become more nuanced as it uses Twitter's own verification to make it more convincing. A Twitter spokesperson told the BBC that the company has ""substantially improved how we tackle crypto-currency scams on the platform"".  ""In recent weeks, user impressions have fallen by a multiple of 10 as we continue to invest in more proactive tools to detect spammy and malicious activity.""

Shaun Bridges was part of the federal task force that helped investigate and shut down the Silk Road - an underground marketplace for drugs. The Silk Road's founder, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to life in prison in May for running the site.  Bridges is the second agent involved in the case caught stealing digital cash. He pleaded guilty to counts of money laundering and obstruction of justice while stealing the virtual cash, during a court hearing on Monday in San Francisco. He will be sentenced in December. Bridges was caught despite trying to conceal his theft via a series of complex financial manoeuvres that were aided by his position as a forensic investigator on the Silk Road case. The vast majority of the $214m of sales made via the site were completed using bitcoins. The theft was carried out while the investigation into the Silk Road site was ongoing. To commit the crimes, Bridges used access he had to an administrator account on the Silk Road to reset passwords and move 20,000 bitcoins to a wallet he controlled.

Bitcoin XT, a new version, is currently being recommended by the currency's chief scientist, Gavin Andresen. And its developer, Mike Hearn, says its adoption is essential to ensure the currency can cope with growing demand. But some, including a large number of bitcoin miners in China, are resisting XT because of how it might affect control over the currency. Bitcoin's blockchain - a digital ledger of all transactions made with the currency - is currently made up of 1MB blocks. Bitcoin XT would enable these blocks to grow to 8MB. But this would mean XT was no longer compatible with existing Bitcoin software, creating, its detractors say, two separate currencies and eroding trust in both. Mr Hearn told the BBC the Bitcoin community's reaction to the release of the XT software at the weekend had been mixed, but there were some encouraging signs. ""We've gone from zero people running the software to 10% of the network in 72 hours, which is really good,"" he said But many are unhappy the core development team at Bitcoin is currently in disagreement over whether Bitcoin XT is right for the future of the currency.  A pool of large Chinese mining groups, for example, have said they will not adopt the software unless it is unanimously adopted by the core team. Mr Hearn said he had decided to force the issue in order to overcome the stalemate. ""If you look at the guys working on the Bitcoin core, they talk about consensus all the time - but if you ask them what they really mean, they can't tell you,"" he said.  ""There is no consensus about what consensus means."" Mr Hearn acknowledged, however, the reduced control developers had under XT would mean they would have to split the currency a second time if they were unhappy with future decisions. ""If we go off the rails and do things that aren't in the best interests of the community, then the solution is fork it again,"" he said. Dr Vili Lehdonvirta, at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the adoption of Bitcoin XT would mean ""the community has much fewer guarantees of being listened to"". ""Those algorithms are made by humans and whoever writes them gets to have power over the system,"" he told the BBC. Dr Lehdonvirta added increasing block size could potentially make Bitcoin less accessible. ""Downloading the whole blockchain is already such an effort that most people choose not to run Bitcoin on their computers,"" he said.

They are all success stories from the Isle of Man.  The small independent island in the middle of the Irish Sea is now hoping to give a wholesome boost to the bad boy of digital currencies, Bitcoin.  Bitcoin tends to hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons - the spectre of infamous Japanese exchange MtGox, which went bankrupt in 2013 after a spate of hacking resulted in the theft of around 650,000 of the virtual coins (today worth around £150/$223 each), still looms large. It has also gained notoriety as the currency for choice for illegal activity because Bitcoin transactions can be carried out anonymously. But the Isle of Man government believes a combination of regulation and encouragement can not only reverse Bitcoin's reputation, but also push it towards the mainstream. Its attractively low taxes and relaxed legislation have already made the island a popular choice of headquarters for the e-gaming industry.  Over the last 12 months the government has been working on incorporating Bitcoin into its anti-money-laundering laws. ""We also passed through parliament the Designated Businesses Bill, which treats digital currency exchanges the same as any other company holding value for a client in escrow [a form of safe keeping],"" said Peter Greenhill, head of e-gaming in the department of economic development. ""Be that a bank, estate agent or accountant - those come under registration with the Financial Supervision Commission."" The government is stopping short of offering customer protection on Bitcoin investments like the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA), which guarantees individual savings to the value of £80,000 in the event of a bank collapse. ""But if we look at the most innovative Bitcoin exchanges they are already putting coins into cold storage, and introducing multiple signatories on coin movement,"" Mr Greenhill added. ""What we've done here on the Isle of Man is to recognize there's an area here that's important to the rest of the world that we can move quickly on in regulation.  ""As long as we do that in a concerted way, to protect individuals and keep crime out, we can respond to the needs of an industry that looks like it's going somewhere."" Entrepreneur Charlie Woolnough set up CoinCorner, the island's only Bitcoin exchange 12 months ago.  He claims that the exchange already has 10,000 global customers, and 500 merchants are using it to accept digital payments. Mr Woolnough told the BBC the banks are still very wary of the digital currency industry. ""One big problem we have had as a Bitcoin business is getting access to mainstream banking. If you're being conspiratorial you could say banks view Bitcoin as a threat,"" he said. ""Maybe a more rational approach is that they view Bitcoin and fintech as high risk right now."" CoinCorner operates on a Know Your Customer (KYC) basis, meaning that in order to open an account you need to upload official ID, proof of address and have your credit or debit cards verified by the firm before you can buy or sell any Bitcoin. Although the exchange has always operated that way, Mr Woolnough is candid about the baggage of legislation, and it certainly slows things down - it took three days for me to open an official account and even then I remained unable to use my cards to buy any currency. ""I don't think anyone wants to be regulated,"" he admitted. ""With regulation comes cost and there's a burden that comes with it. ""But we are acting in a fiduciary capacity - anyone who expects this industry to remain unregulated really is living in cloud cuckoo land. the Isle of Man has just been the first mover in this. ""Bitcoin is the currency of the internet and a leading part of fintech."" But outside that rather exclusive world of the financial technology industry, what do the more everyday businesses make of the drive to go digital? The Thirsty Pigeon Pub on the Isle of Man town Douglas proudly accepts Bitcoin.  On the bar in front of the till sits a tablet computer for customers wishing to settle their tab with their digital wallet. ""Not many people really understand it I think,"" said landlord Robert McAleer, who admitted that not many Bitcoin payments had been made since a digital currency conference, held on the island last October, attracted Bitcoin enthusiasts in their droves. ""People need more information. and more people need to adopt it, more shops more bars."" Taxi driver Nula Perryn, who founded all-female cab company The Lady Chauffeurs, agreed. ""We do about 2 or 3 [Bitcoin payments] a week,"" she told the BBC.  ""I think it's a bit of a gimmick... as a new firm it's something to get us noticed - however I do feel there's a very strong movement from e-gaming.  ""The government is behind it... there's a lot of will behind it."" Island entrepreneur Adrian Forbes believes one solution may lie in making Bitcoin a lot less ephemeral.  His new start-up TGBex is selling physical coins (his lawyer is very keen to call them tokens, he insists, as they are not legal tender). Each coin comes with a QR code so that the owner can transfer the value into their digital wallet. ""Bitcoin for technophobes is what I like to call it,"" he said. ""I have three young kids and I wanted to buy them a bitcoin each - but [some of] the exchanges have failed or been hacked... for me I think offline storage is the safest at the the moment."" It is a high risk investment, he conceded - but he's not keen on the government getting too involved. ""I'm not a big fan [of legislation]. ""I see Bitcoin as something very niche. I don't think it requires same licences as banks and stockbrokers and hedge funds that have a thousand times as much money at stake. ""Bitcoin will work best in the third world first. In the west, it's a novelty, niche technology, a bit of fun. ""It might be advantageous in terms of speed but there's no real need for it.""

Cases include that of a customer at a branch of TSB branch in Stowmarket, Suffolk, who tried to withdraw £19,000.

Money laundering, so-called after gangster Al Capone's practice of hiding criminal proceeds in cash-only laundromats in the 1920s, is a huge and growing problem. ""Dirty"" money is ""cleaned"" by passing it through layers of seemingly legitimate banks and businesses and using it to buy properties, businesses, expensive cars, works of art - anything that can be sold on for new cash. And one of the ways criminals do this is called ""smurfing"". Specialist software is used to arrange lots of tiny bank deposits that slip below the radar, explains Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, a financial crime AI provider headquartered in Israel. ""A $0.25 transaction will never be spotted by a human, but transactions of that kind can launder $30m if they are done hundreds of millions of times,"" he says. And stolen money is often laundered to fund further criminal activity. One recent ATM (cash machine) scam cost banks €1bn (£854m) in total across 40 countries, for example. ""The gang hacked into thousands of ATMs and programmed them to release up to five notes at a certain time - say 3am - at which point a local criminal or 'money mule' would pick it up,"" says Mr Gazit. ""The money was then converted into Bitcoin and used to fund human trafficking."" ""Money mules"" are often recruited to launder this gang cash through their legitimate bank accounts in return for a fee.  ""Estimates suggest that not even 1% of criminal funds flowing through the international financial system is confiscated,"" says Colin Bell, group head of financial crime risk at HSBC. And the problem seems to be getting worse, despite tightening regulations.  In the UK alone, financial crime Suspicious Activity Reports increased by 10% in 2018, according to the National Crime Agency. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the BBC it was working on ""applied technical enhancements"" to its armoury of crime-fighting tools to help it keep up with advances in financial tech, but remains understandably tight-lipped on the details. However, other organisations are openly talking about their use of AI to fight the money launderers. More Technology of Business ""AI that applies 'machine learning' can sift through vast quantities of transactions quickly and effectively,"" explains HSBC's Mr Bell.  ""This could be a vital tool for pinpointing suspicious activity."" For this reason, AI is good at spotting smurfing attempts and accounts that are set up remotely by bots rather than humans, for example.  And it can also spot suspicious behaviour by corrupt insiders - a key element in many money laundering operations. ""Using AI removes much of the risk of people deliberately overlooking suspicious activity,"" says Adam Williamson, head of professional standards at the UK's Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) - a professional body tasked with helping accountants avoid money laundering. Many of the world's biggest banks have been embroiled in money laundering scandals in recent years. Earlier this year, Swiss banking giant UBS was hit with a €3.7bn (£3.2bn) fine after being found guilty of helping wealthy clients in France hide billions of euros from tax authorities and launder the proceeds. It is appealing against the decision. Last year, Dutch bank ING paid out €775 million for failing to stop criminals laundering money through its accounts. And Danske Bank's boss was forced to quit over a €200bn money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch.  In Latvia, too, the country's third largest bank ABLV Bank AS, was wound up after US authorities accused it of large-scale money laundering that had enabled its clients to violate nuclear weapons sanctions against North Korea. AI can crunch mountains of data in real time - emails, phone calls, expense reports - and spot patterns of behaviour humans might not notice across a global banking group.  Once the system has learned legitimate behaviour patterns it can then more easily spot dodgy activity and learn from that. Regulators around the world are encouraging the new technology, perhaps in acknowledgement that they are losing the battle.   US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth A. Blanco says: ""Financial institutions have been improving their ability to identify customers and monitor transactions by experimenting with artificial intelligence and machine learning. ""FinCEN encourages these and other financial services-related innovations."" AI tech firms, such as ThetaRay, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Refinitiv, are offering businesses tools to tackle money laundering, but there are concerns that this presents its own problems. ""If organisations are buying AI off the shelf, how can they convince regulators they are in control of it?"" asks the AAT's Adam Williamson.  And as good as AI might be at spotting anomalies when sifting through huge swathes of data, it is only as effective as the data it is fed. So there is a growing recognition of the need for banks, financial institutions, governments, and law enforcement agencies to share more information. ""Europol is designed to operate in partnership with law enforcement agencies, governmental departments and other stakeholders,"" says the agency's deputy executive director Wil van Gemert. ""We embrace the idea of collective intelligence."" Mark Hayward, a member of the UK's new Economic Crime Strategic Board, set up in January, says: ""Data sharing is one of our main priorities"".  And legislation has to keep up with the latest trends in financial services that criminals can exploit. The terrorists behind the 2016 Nice truck attack, for example, paid for the vehicles by pre-paid card to take advantage of the anonymity these cards afford the user. This is why the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive introduced last year includes  digital currencies and prepaid cards for the first time. Given that the criminals appear to be winning, any tools that can help tackle the problem must surely be welcome.

155,'Bitcoin creator' denies involvement,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26481646,2014-03-07 11:45:05+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The man named by a magazine as the inventor of Bitcoin earlier this week has denied any involvement. Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto said he had not even heard of the virtual currency until a few weeks ago. Nakamoto was singled out as the man who wrote the code underpinning Bitcoin by Newsweek. But he said that quotes attributed to him that seemed to suggest his discontinued involvement with the project had been ""misunderstood"". ""I got nothing to do with it,"" Nakamoto told a reporter on Thursday.  He was identified as the ""face behind Bitcoin"" in an article published online this week. A reporter spent about two months investigating the claim and tracking him down. When the reporter - flanked by two police officers - found the 64-year-old former physicist at his home in California and asked him if he was involved with Bitcoin, he is reported to have said: ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."" But he told an Associated Press reporter on Thursday: ""I'm saying I'm no longer in engineering, that's it. And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract, saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that's what I implied. ""It sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I'm not involved now. That's not what I meant. I want to clarify that,"" he said. Nakamoto said he was born in Japan and moved to America in 1959 and that English was not his first language. The value of Bitcoin has fluctuated as knowledge of and interest in what was until recently a little-known currency has increased. It is used to bypass financial institutions, making it attractive to people who want to trade directly. That has led to a level of adoption by speculative investors and some criminal enterprises. In 2012, a leaked FBI report showed that the the agency was concerned that Bitcoin could become widely used by criminals. The report said that the virtual currency was an ""increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm"".  And, in August the following year, it was announced that the ""scale of the risk posed by"" Bitcoin was to be investigated by the FBI on behalf of a US Senate committee. The entity behind it has always been known as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", although it is unknown whether or not that is a pseudonym.  Nakamoto insisted he had never heard of Gavin Andresen, a leading Bitcoin developer. The latter told Newsweek he had worked closely with the person or entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in developing the system, but that they never met in person or spoke on the phone. Nakamoto told the AP that he would have had the technical ability to come up with Bitcoin. He said: ""Capability? Yes, but any programmer could do that."" He also admitted that elements of the Newsweek story were correct. He said that he did once work for a defence contractor.  He added that he also worked on missile systems for the US Navy and Air Force and, consequently, it was necessary to keep many details of his work confidential. Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman, who spent two months researching the story, told the AP: ""I stand completely by my exchange with Mr Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin.""",-0.0141103448275862,-0.029980842911877394
156,Bitcoin backers seek to create 'regulated' exchange,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30949658,2015-01-23 12:28:38+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The Winklevoss twins, who clashed with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook, are seeking approval for a Bitcoin exchange overseen by US regulators.  The pair plan to have the exchange, called Gemini, trading later this year, reports the New York Times. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are known to have invested millions in the virtual currency. Currently the value of each bitcoin is approaching $200 (£133) - far below the $1,200-high it hit in November 2013. Development work on software underpinning the exchange is being carried out at the Bitcoin start-up founded by the Winklevoss twins. In addition, they have been lobbying New York financial regulators to drum up support for the idea and have signed up banks to handle deposits and transfers. Work on the exchange began after New York's financial services watchdog last year encouraged virtual currency entrepreneurs operating in the state to apply for formal recognition. This, said the watchdog, was the first step towards full regulation of such exchanges. The twins won a $65m payout from Mark Zuckerberg after accusing him of stealing their idea for a college-based social network. Bitcoin is a virtual currency built around a complicated cryptographic protocol and a global network of computers that oversees and verifies which coins have been spent by whom.  Exchanges, through which virtual money can be traded for real cash or to other owners, have been one of the weak points in the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Some have gone bust leaving traders out of pocket, many have been robbed of all their deposits and now more and more nations are seeking to impose strict controls on how they operate. The value of each bitcoin has fluctuated widely over the last few years but has been on a steady downward path since late 2013 even though many more online stores and companies accept them in exchange for goods and services.

Best known for selling illegal drugs, Silk Road was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies. The man accused of running the site, Ross Ulbricht, was convicted in February, and prosecutors argued that he had earned about $18m in Bitcoin from the operation. Mr Force, who worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), served as an undercover agent during the investigation into the Silk Road.

Richard Sinclair, 32, was arrested after police seized drugs worth an estimated £100,000 at his home at Cranagh Road, Coleraine, on 26 August. In a separate raid, Kyle Hall, 25, of Chamberlain Street, Belfast, was also detained. Both men were refused bail.  The ""dark web"" is a collection of websites that hide the operator's identity.  Drugs linked to a European-wide investigation were to be sent through the post hidden inside jigsaw puzzles, prosecutors said. The men are jointly charged with conspiracy to supply and possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. Mr Sinclair is also charged with transferring criminal property, while Mr Hall faces charges of having Class B and C drugs with intent to supply and possessing criminal property. In court in Belfast on Friday, a prosecution lawyer said police discovered Mr Sinclair in his bedroom destroying evidence on an encrypted memory stick. Hundreds of drugs transactions were displayed on a nearby computer, the lawyer claimed. The court was told police also seized five sealed packages from his home. Two were DVD boxes with £1,500 cash in each and the other three contained suspected MDMA powder - the base from which ecstasy is made - the prosecution said. A further £6,000 in cash and quantities of LSD were also recovered. Police were also alerted to a parcel addressed to Mr Sinclair at a courier depot in Belfast. It contained two jigsaw puzzles with a total of 3,000 MDMA and other psychedelic pills with a potential street value of £40,000.  CCTV footage allegedly showed Mr Hall had left the parcel at the depot. Police searched his home and seized 1,000 ecstasy tablets, 120 boxes each containing 28 diazepam pills, 2kg of herbal cannabis, 500g of crystal MDMA and £7,500 in cash, the court heard.  The lawyer set out admissions made by Mr Sinclair in police interviews. This was a complex investigation involving mainland Europe, in particular the Netherlands, the lawyer said. She said police described his method as ""ingenious"". Despite Mr Sinclair's admissions, his defence lawyer argued he did not fit the profile of a high-flying drug supplier and was feeding his gambling habit. ""It simply mushroomed and got out of control,"" he said. Although Mr Hall also made admissions, he denied conspiring with Mr Sinclair.

BTC China, the world's largest Bitcoin operator by trading volume, has said that local payment companies have been blocked from providing it with clearing services. It means that the firm can no longer accept yuan-based deposits. GT Zhou, an experienced Bitcoin trader, tells the Beijing Times that the virtual currency ""is unlikely to exit the Chinese market, but investors need to be cautious about the risks involved"". Another unnamed trader tells the Bejing Times that ""Bitcoin value had been rising sharply in the Chinese market until the latest measures were announced. The margin for profits is falling now and the trading may completely move out of China"". Sina news portal echoes similar views, saying ""the virtual currency has posed a threat to China's capital control and there are concerns that China would take further measures to limit the development of the Bitcoin"". However, Li Qiyuan, the CEO of BTC China, tells the Oriental Morning Post that ""his website will not close down and they are not planning to trade in the US dollars because the central bank has not made the trading of Bitcoin illegal in China"". Moving on to political news, most websites and papers are giving prominent coverage to President Xi Jinping's statement that the central government's stand on the election of Hong Kong's next chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017 has been ""consistent and clear"". ""Mr Xi expressed hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong would unite and lay the foundation for a smooth election during a meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung,"" Xinhua reports. The Southern Metropolis Daily says Mr Xi and Mr Leung had a ""pragmatic discussion"" on the issue, while the Ta Kung Pao sees the talks as Beijing's backing of the Hong Kong chief's work.

This ATM chews up your £10 notes rather than spewing them out, and in return you get a computer code. This is the world's first Bitcoin cash machine and if the people showing it to me are to be believed, it shows us the future of money.          I found it at the Bitcoin London conference, the biggest event about the crypto currency yet staged in the UK. The crowd at this event is young, mostly male - and often evangelical about the subject they have come to discuss. These are interesting times to hold a Bitcoin conference. The currency has seen wild gyrations, with new investors rushing in, then rapidly finding that prices can go down as well up. Regulators have been taking a closer interest, particularly since another innovative currency scheme, Liberty Reserve, proved to be a haven for criminals and money launderers.  And on Tuesday, some of the biggest investors in Bitcoin, the Winklevoss brothers of Facebook fame, have announced plans to float a business based on the virtual currency.  If you were looking for reasons to be either cheerful or cynical about the prospects for Bitcoin, you could have found both in the conference room high above Canary Wharf.  What struck me was how professional, intense and deeply knowledgeable about their subject most of the speakers seemed. The professionals have moved in. ""It's not a bunch of 16-year-olds in basements any more, it's institutions,"" as one speaker put it. There were lawyers, venture capitalists and software developers, as well as people who had just put a lot of their own money into Bitcoin.  There was plenty of hype about the prospects for the currency: Other speakers predicted that Bitcoin would become the natural means of exchange in African countries, where so many people have mobile phones but so few have bank accounts. And another described how Iceland, already a digital pioneer, could switch entirely to Bitcoin. The strong libertarian tendency that is a characteristic of Bitcoin enthusiasts was on display too, with speakers railing against regulation in the United States: ""Stay the hell away from the US"" was the advice to a query from someone wanting to know where best to set up a Bitcoin business. Somewhat surprisingly, a lawyer who worked in this field told the conference that the EU was five years ahead in the way it thought about framing policies for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. But amidst all the enthusiasm, there were still questions about the long-term viability of the idea and how likely it was to enter the mainstream. One sobering moment came when a software developer described how he'd lost 7,000 Bitcoins because they had not been backed up properly to his computer. That had cost him about $200,000 which he would never see again. ""You get over it,"" he told the crowd. And the sheer complexity of getting and spending Bitcoins is another issue. Asked how the attractions of the currency would be communicated to the public, one speaker said everyone would need to learn computer science. Good luck with that... For myself, I am beginning to get the hang of how you obtain the virtual currency - it is spending it which is the bigger problem. I already had a Bitcoin wallet on my phone, which meant using the ATM at the conference was relatively simple. I showed the machine the barcode which is the public address of my wallet, and once I'd inserted a £10 note into the slot, it popped up as roughly 0.2 Bitcoin on the phone screen within seconds. In all I had 0.7 Bitcoin - worth about £43 at Tuesday's exchange rate. And by this time I was hungry. Sadly, nowhere nearby seemed to take Bitcoin in exchange for food. Evangelists for the crypto currency say it's flexible, durable, secure and transportable. Now all they need to do is make sure it's useable.",0.1546909090909091,0.13114452606876847
163,Bitcoin: Price v hype,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25332746,2013-12-13 11:40:45+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Virtual currency Bitcoin has attracted increasing media attention over the past year. It's also soaring in value, with a single bitcoin surpassing $1,000 (£613) for the first time in November. So has the media hype driven the price hike? To the average man in the street, Bitcoin is a complicated concept.   You might grasp what a typical currency is. The pound is influenced by a central bank - the Bank of England. When it puts up interests rates, or it's expected to, the value of the pound might subsequently go up.  If the Bank of England prints more money, or there is speculation that it will, the value's probably going to go down. Ultimately, the value's determined between buyers and sellers on the international markets.  Bitcoin's a bit different. There's no central bank. It's stateless. And the supply of Bitcoin is determined by an algorithm that allows computers around the world to ""mine"" the currency at a set rate per day.  There's a limit - about 21m - to how many can ever be mined and no way to issue a flood of new Bitcoins and devalue those already in circulation.  The currency's value - according to about 60 exchanges around the world where Bitcoins are bought and sold - is volatile. Unlike with the dollar or the pound, prices can vary considerably from exchange to exchange, sometimes by as much as $200.  But compared with other currencies, Bitcoin's rise has been meteoric. One Bitcoin was worth $934 on the Tokyo-based Mt Gox exchange on 10 December - up from $14 at the beginning of the year. This Tokyo exchange now represents about 25% of Bitcoin trading, down from estimates earlier this year of about 80%, but remaining one of the largest. At the same time, there has never been so much talk about virtual currency - in social media, in blogs and in the press. Depending on who you speak to, Bitcoin is either the currency of the future or the next big bubble.  Commentators have suggested a correlation between publicity and price rise before. In November, TechCrunch's Alex Wilhelm said Bitcoin's price had ""never been worth more, or generated more headlines that I can recall. The two are likely connected"" and the Financial Times' John Authers writes: ""Time to take the Bitcoin bubble seriously."" It's hard to get a definitive measurement of Bitcoin's press coverage. But one crude and slightly unscientific way of measuring it is using media database Lexis Nexis. Searching for ""bitcoin"" across all English language news brought up 2,631 articles in November. This is up from 41 in January this year.  In online media and in blogs, Bitcoin came up 14,179 times in November in the US alone - up from 187 times in January, according to PR software company Cision UK. So has Bitcoin's rising profile boosted its price?   Michael Jackson, a partner at venture capital firm Mangrove Capital Partners, says some changes in the price of Bitcoin have clearly been because of demand fuelled by media coverage.  He cites November's recent rise as an example. ""There has for sure not been a single event that has economically justified a price increase of five times in any commodity - possibly ever - over 30 days other than pure speculation,"" he says.   On the surface, there seem to be some obvious correlations.  But the caveat is that bursts of coverage have often stemmed from major events that would clearly have an impact on the value of the currency. Other outbreaks can't be traced to a particular event. Motherboard: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto? The closure of clandestine online marketplace Silk Road - which required users to pay for their transactions using Bitcoins and was famed for selling drugs and other illegal items - in October led to a surge in media coverage. While Bitcoin's price initially dropped, it quickly bounced back.  November saw an even greater spike in media coverage when a US Senate committee hearing unexpectedly said virtual currencies were a ""legitimate financial service"" with the same benefits and risks as other online payment systems. Bitcoin rocketed in value and broke the $1,000 mark just over a week later. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, thinks the ""common denominator"" in press hype and price hike tends to be when Bitcoin gets some regulatory attention. ""It might seem somewhat counterintuitive,"" says Hileman, noting the roots of Bitcoin's popularity in the difficulty of tracing transactions, ""but on the whole regulation has seen the price of Bitcoin explode upwards. Publicity is a big driver of that."" He cites the price rise in April - which he thinks was largely attributable to regulatory guidance issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which oversees anti-money laundering efforts, as well as the Cypriot financial crisis - as another example. Media coverage also rose in both months.  But Bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn says most of the currency's price fluctuations are ""self-fuelling"". ""Sudden price movements attract the attention of the media, which writes about it, and that then causes more people to decide to get involved so the price goes up, so more people start speculating. ""This accelerates until it turns into a pure speculative bubble which then pops, leaving the price down from the peak but up from where it started,"" he says. Hearn says this pattern has repeated itself several times, citing April's ""huge press cycle"" as an example. Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index charts Bitcoin soaring to more than $200 after a surge in media interest, then dropping sharply to $120 after the Mt Gox exchange was hit by hack attacks. Its value the increased again in the space of a week.  However, there are exceptions to the media-price correlation.  Media coverage on Lexis Nexis shot up to 2,548 mentions in May. It was the month that Silk Road was knocked offline by a cyberattack.   Bitcoin's price was not hit by volatility though. Jackson believes the story was a ""great general interest story - a kind of mysterious, James Bond story"" - which captured the media's attention. But he says he is not convinced how much turnover the site was actually generating.  He says the whole market is driven by speculation not usage.   Like all currencies, Bitcoin's value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. ""If you look at the pound or a typical currency, there is movement all the time. But not many people are using Bitcoins to do real transactions. ""Since the value is purely driven by the demand from incoming investors, hoping to make a quick buck, rather than any utility, this growth seems close to a Ponzi scheme,"" he says.  There is also a small group of people that have huge vested interests in Bitcoin which are ramping up its value with stories of Bitcoin millionaires and its progress towards legitimacy, he argues.  There are currently about 11 million Bitcoins in existence, with some concentrated holdings, which explains why trading exchanges are more susceptible to media puffery than other currencies. Jackson believes there is demand for a virtual currency - to enable people to pay for things and subscribe to content online without needing multiple different accounts, and to move or trade assets instantaneously without fees - and that existing regulation is adequate to support its use.  But he says Bitcoin's instability, untraceability and transaction irreversibility mean that it will never become the currency of the future in its current form. ""Media hype is creating buzz but we are a long way from it being a mainstream currency,"" he says.   Hileman says the history of alternative currencies ""shouldn't give investors a lot of comfort, because they die"" but the furore about Bitcoin is ""the most exciting thing since the internet"".  There has also been a tonal shift in media coverage, he argues.  ""There was a real hostility towards Bitcoin at the beginning. Now there are stories about Argentinean farmers using Bitcoin as a way of generating income for families,"" he says.  Buying Bitcoins while their price is so bubbly seems to be a gamble. The European Banking Authority has just issued a warning on the risks of virtual currencies, saying consumers using them as a means of payment are not protected by regulation. But investing in companies that enable the ecosystem to develop could be a sensible use of a venture capitalist's money, Jackson muses.

The Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) has been certified by the Jersey Financial Services Commission to run from 1 August. Daniel Masters said Jersey's regulatory system meant major investors, such as pension and insurance companies, could invest in Bitcoin for the first time. The fund will not be open to investments from the general public. Global Advisors is a Jersey-based hedge fund company which usually specialises in commodities such as metals and oil.  Bitcoin was founded in 2009 although nobody knows by whom. Each Bitcoin, like other forms of crypto-currencies, is simply a long string of computer code protected by a personal key which provides ownership and security. All Bitcoins in circulation and their transactions histories are recorded in a giant ledger known as the blockchain. This prevents Bitcoins from being spent twice. No middleman is required to verify the transaction so they are quick, secure and cheap to use. Are crypto-currencies the future of money? Mr Masters said investors would have to conform to the same security checks as those undertaken with mainstream financial products. ""For institutions there are no options right now,"" he said.  ""This is institutional strength and it's an absolute world first."" Island leaders want Jersey to become a global centre for digital currencies and Bitcoin payments are already accepted by some local businesses. There have been issues around the digital currency, including a lack of regulation and concerns over potential for money laundering and other illegal activity. In October 2013 the FBI shut down online marketplace Silk Road, which traded in drugs and other illegal goods and took payments using ""crypto-currencies"". ""There is an anonymity associated with Bitcoin... but any cash or any Bitcoin coming into or out of our fund has to be fully identified under KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, so there will be no dictators or criminals sending us money,"" said Mr Masters.",-0.02758235294117647,0.013576875194522253

I am not talking about the value of the individual bits of the new virtual currency, which has had a somewhat volatile history and is currently spiralling down. What excites is the development, by Bitcoin enthusiasts, known as miners, of a super-efficient money transmission network on the internet, that bypasses the official banking and money transmission systems - or at least it is a hermetically sealed monetary world until holders of the virtual currency want to buy a hamburger or motor car and endeavour to convert their Bitcoins into dollars, pounds or other forms of legal tender. However, Bitcoin probably represents the first seriously existential threat to conventional banks, burdened with their massive running costs, in living memory. In theory, at least, Bitcoin is their Amazon.  Bitcoin also poses something of an issue for central banks like the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve, which appear to have no ability to influence the value of Bitcoins. So Bitcoin represents a challenge to their duties of monetary stewardship. And it is not at all clear whether the writ of financial regulators runs to the Bitcoin world. So depending on your point of view, Bitcoin is either a wonderfully liberating new financial system, freed of the costs and poisonous history of the old banking and monetary world, or it is the dangerous and wacky Wild West, where law-abiding folk should fear to tread. Which is it? Well we may be about to find out, following the disappearance from the internet of MtGox, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges - amidst rumours of all sorts of shenanigans and allegations that vast quantities of the currency have gone walkies. The point is that Bitcoin's strength - that it has grown in an organic, slightly anarchic and devolved way, with no central oversight or control - is also its weakness. There is no central authority to step in and give any kind of guidance to Mt Gox customers whether their money is safe or gone. And there's no compensation safety net. Bitcoin has been set up on the basis of pure caveat emptor. If its participants take any losses in their stride, and learn the lessons, it can go from strength to strength. If they are unable to develop any kind of governance system that provides confidence that Bitcoins are where they are supposed to be, then it will disintegrate into fringe territory for loons and wild-eyed monetary anarchists.

A couple of hours later though, I only had $79 (£51). But by this morning my phone told me I had $93 (£60) to spend. Actually, what I had was 0.53 in Bitcoin, the virtual currency whose wild gyrations over the last 24 hours have raised questions about its long-term viability.    I got my Bitcoin a couple of weeks ago, because I was making a radio piece about the currency. My mission then was to work out how easy it was to get and then spend Bitcoins - and I eventually ended up with a rather expensive pizza, ordered via an American site and delivered by a London chain.  The whole cumbersome process of getting and spending the currency invented in 2009 by a mysterious Japanese (or possibly American) man called Satashi Nakamoto convinced me of one thing - that Bitcoin was not yet much use except as a means of speculation.  The only reason to get hold of Bitcoins right now is because you think they might be worth a lot more in a few hours or days. Now if you bought into the market back in January when you could get one Bitcoin for $15 (£10) you'd have been pretty smug yesterday when the price hit a new high of $260 (£170).  But if you were one of those who found out about Bitcoin from the mass of recent  media and bought at yesterday's peak, then you've learned a valuable lesson - like tulips in the 17th Century and London houses in 1988, prices can go down as well as up. There have been all sorts of explanations of what caused yesterday's crash - from a problem at the main exchange to a strange incident in which someone called Bitcoinbillionaire apparently started giving away large sums on the social news site Reddit.   A likelier reason is our old friends Greed and Fear combining to inflate and then depress prices as all those new arrivals crowded into the market. All this talk of a Bitcoin bubble has annoyed the true believers - an interesting mixture of libertarians and cryptographic specialists charmed by the idea of a currency that embodies many of the open and virtually ungoverned principles of the internet itself.   They maintain that the key feature of Bitcoin is that the supply can never exceed a certain number - 21 million - and that it has recovered from previous crashes when its demise was predicted. What is true is that we are seeing a fascinating experiment in what a currency of the future might look like. But unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers.",0.18541875,0.06389768217893217
168,Quadriga: Cryptocurrency exchange founder's death locks $140m,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47123371,2019-02-04 21:45:33+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange is unable to access millions in digital currency following the sudden death of its founder. Quadriga has filed for creditor protection and estimates that about C$180m ($137m; £105m) in cryptocurrency coins is missing.  It has not been able to locate or secure its cryptocurrency reserves since Gerald Cotten  died in December.  Cotten, 30, had sole responsibility for handling the funds and coins.  In court documents filed with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on 31 January, his widow Jennifer Robertson, says the laptop on which Cotten ""carried out the companies' business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key"".  ""Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere,"" the affidavit states.  The company hired an investigator to see if any information could be retrieved but ongoing efforts have had only ""limited success in recovering a few coins"" and some information from Cotten's computer and phone.  The company is also investigating whether some of the cryptocurrency could be secured on other exchanges, according to court files.  They say about 115,000 Quadriga users hold balances in their personal accounts in the form of cash obligations and cryptocurrency.  The company estimates it owes about C$250m ($190m; £145m) - including C$70m in hard currency. The affidavit says the majority of the cryptocurrency was kept by Quadriga in a ""cold wallet"" or ""cold storage"", which is located offline and used to secure cryptocurrency from hacking or theft.  Liquidity problems for the British Columbia-based company began in January 2018 when Canadian bank CIBC froze C$25.7m linked to its payment processor after the bank had difficulty determining who were the owners of the money.  Those problems have been compounded by Cotten's passing.  The founder died unexpectedly due to complications with Crohn's disease while travelling in India, according to court documents.  In a statement posted online last Thursday, Quadriga said it is working to address its ""liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallet"".  The company is due in court in Nova Scotia on Tuesday for a preliminary hearing on appointing firm Ernst and Young as an independent monitor to oversee the proceedings.

169,Bitcoin price falls to 11-month low,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29507443,2014-10-06 13:40:13+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The value of one bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level for almost a year. On Sunday afternoon Bitcoin hit a low of $290 (£181), and the virtual currency lost about 18% of its value across the whole weekend. The crypto-currency has seen its value steadily fall since December 2013, when each bitcoin was briefly worth more than $1,100. Economic experts put the steady fall in value down to the internal mechanics of the system used to generate bitcoins. Since the fall at the weekend, values have recovered. Now, according to Coindesk, individual bitcoins are worth about $330 (£263) each. An increasing number of shops and payment-processing firms have signed up to let people use the virtual currency to pay for goods and services.  Paypal's announcement in late September that it was putting in place systems to let its merchants accept bitcoins caused a brief bump in the value of the crypto-cash, but this has now been eroded. Some speculated that the fall was due in part to the greater number of businesses accepting bitcoins, which had led to more of the coins being in circulation, depressing prices.  However, said economic historian Garrick Hileman from the London School of Economics, the numbers of bitcoins being put back into circulation via this route was not significant enough to affect prices so markedly and for so long. The most recent swings in value were down to speculative trading, he said, but this did not explain the long term decline. One significant factor, he said, was the steady supply of new bitcoins introduced in to the market every day by miners. These are people who use powerful computers to carry out the complicated mathematics involved in validating transactions made in bitcoins. In return for carrying out this work, miners are regularly rewarded with newly minted bitcoins. ""Approximately every 10 minutes 25 new bitcoins are mined into existence, which works out to approximately 3,600 new bitcoins created every day,"" he said. ""At current prices that's $1.2m in new supply coming into existence every day.""  Miners converted some of their coins to pay for the power needed to keep machines running and to ensure they used the fastest computers available, he said.  ""How much of this $1.2m miners have to sell to pay for these things is a closely guarded trade secret, but unless the market can absorb the new bitcoins which miners sell, the price will fall,"" he said. In addition, said Mr Hileman, a whole host of other factors including regulatory concerns, competition from alternative payment systems and the strength of the dollar were all impinging on the Bitcoin world. Not all Bitcoin enthusiasts were worried by the ongoing slide. Roger Ver, who has invested in several Bitcoin start-ups, pointed out in a tweet that those holding bitcoins had enjoyed a good year. ""For anyone complaining about the current price of Bitcoin, remember it has more than doubled over the last 12 months."" he wrote. His message was accompanied by a graph of values from exchange Bitstamp, which showed this time last year the Bitcoin was worth about $120.",0.20775454545454544,0.07759986225895316

The members resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation following the election of entrepreneur Brock Pierce to its board. Some of those that resigned said their decision had been prompted by allegations about Mr Pierce's past behaviour that involved drugs and sexual misconduct. Mr Pierce denied the allegations about his former behaviour.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins.

To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent. ""None of it is true,"" said Mr Pierce in a short video statement posted to the Bitcoin Foundation's discussion forum. The accusations were made in 2000 when Mr Pierce, a former Disney child star, was involved with a web video company called Digital Entertainment Network that filed for bankruptcy.  The Bitcoin Foundation played down the resignations.  But some of those that resigned posted comments to the foundation's discussion forum explaining their decision. ""The track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal,"" wrote Patrick Alexander. ""I no longer want to be associated with these people."" Places on the board of the foundation had opened up after two resignations. In January. developer Charlie Shrem stepped down after being arrested and charged with money laundering in connection with the Bitcoin firm he helped to run. In addition, in February Mark Karpeles resigned as the exchange he founded, MtGox, stopped transferring bitcoins to external addresses while it investigated ""unusual activity"". The investigation revealed attackers had made off with millions of dollars of bitcoins and forced the shutdown of MtGox. The resignations come as the Bitcoin Foundation holds its annual conference, which this year is taking place in Amsterdam. Patrick Murck, chief lawyer for the Bitcoin Foundation, said the organisation had 1,500 members and would recover from the resignations. ""Democracy is messy sometimes,"" Mr Murck told Reuters.

The work is due to be completed within ""the coming months"", said Braintree boss Bill Ready in a conference speech. It means that firms such as Uber and Airbnb, which use Braintree as a payment processor, will also be able to accept bitcoins. So far, there is no indication that bitcoins will be accepted directly by Paypal and eBay. During his speech at the Techcrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, Mr Ready said Braintree's work should be seen as its ""first foray"" into using bitcoins. Braintree processes payments on mobiles and websites and said it would work with Bitcoin payments site Coinbase to process transactions carried out with the crypto-currency. Bitcoins are a form of money that use unique numbers instead of notes and coins as a store of monetary value. In November 2013, the value of one bitcoin hit $1,000 (£620) but it has fallen sharply and now each one is worth about $470 (£290). Braintree's work meant that tens of thousands of merchants would soon be able to accept the digital cash too, said Mr Ready. Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg that Braintree's announcement was a ""very substantial development"". He added that it might also speed up adoption by Paypal which would mean ""millions of retailers will de facto be accepting bitcoin overnight"". Paypal spent about $800m (£500m) in September 2013 to buy Braintree, largely because of its role in mobile payment systems.  Braintree's announcement comes as Wired reports on an attempt to unmask Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The tech news site said a hacker has claimed to have take control of an email account known to be used by the reclusive inventor who has never revealed their true identity. The hacker said they would supply information that would lead to the identification of Mr Nakamoto if they were paid 25 bitcoins (£7,300). Wired was sceptical of the claim to have information about Mr Nakamoto as little evidence was provided by the hacker for his assertion. An earlier attempt to unmask Mr Nakamoto was made by Newsweek which claimed an American called Dorian Prentice Nakamoto was the elusive inventor. He denied being the creator and interest in the claim led to the real Satoshi Nakamoto issuing a short statement refuting any link with Dorian Nakamoto.",0.1270888888888889,0.0841931216931217
174,Could Bitcoin ease the pain of Africa's migrant workforce?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31735976,2015-03-10 00:34:46+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Over 30 million Africans live in the diaspora. They sent almost $40bn (£26.5bn) home in 2014, a figure that is likely to grow significantly in the coming years. While north African countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Egypt receive the most, east African countries are particularly dependent on remittances.  The average per migrant is almost $1,200, representing 5% of GDP on a country-by-country average. Yet the cost of sending this money is high.  The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) reports Africans in the diaspora pay an average of 12.3% to money transmitters to send $200 home, while the cost of sending money between African countries is also high. Each year, the ODI says total fees amount to $1.4bn. Part of the reason for these high costs could be a lack of competition; Western Union and MoneyGram control 50% or more of the remittance market in most Sub-Saharan African countries. But help may be at hand from an unlikely source: digital currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin gets a negative press in the western world, especially after the collapse of the Mt.Gox exchange and the cryptocurrency's fluctuating value.  But a number of companies are betting on Africa as the destination where it could see the biggest uptake and have the most impact. Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of Bitcoin remittance service BitPesa, which allows workers overseas to send money home to Kenya and Ghana for a flat fee of 3% and says it is growing its user base by 60% month-on-month, believes the shortage of payment options in Africa make it a fertile ground in which Bitcoin can grow. ""Credit cards are only available to less than 3% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa. PayPal is blocked in many countries or much more expensive in the few it is operating. Bank transfers and remittance corridors are two to three times the price as elsewhere,"" she says.  ""So in terms of a need for a cheap, fast, functioning alternative form of payment, yes - Bitcoin does have a greater opportunity in sub-Saharan Africa."" Timothy Stranex, co-founder of South African Bitcoin exchange BitX, believes Bitcoin could be the first online payment method available to many people given the low credit card penetration, while he also expects uptake from merchants wishing to accept payments from foreign customers. ""In an increasingly global world, international payments are becoming increasingly important,"" he says.  ""Bitcoin provides a much easier way for businesses and consumers to participate in the global economy than traditional systems."" Rick Day, co-founder of Igot, another Bitcoin exchange recently launched in Africa, says Bitcoin is gaining popularity in Africa ""slowly but surely"". Since its launch in early 2014, Igot has counted more than 200,000 transactions. ""As more and more people realise the value of Bitcoin, the speed of its transaction and the low cost, they are more inclined to use it. We expect the Bitcoin industry in Africa to grow in the next six to 12 months as more entrepreneurs enter the market,"" he said. The other reason why those setting up Bitcoin businesses in Africa are hopeful the digital currency is set to go far is the fact Africans have already shown themselves willing to adopt alternative forms of moving money around. Mobile money has taken off on the continent, with figures from the Central Bank of Kenya indicating Kenyans alone transferred over $11bn using mobile money services in the fast half of 2014.  Meanwhile Kenyan operator Safaricom - the first operator to provide an effective platform for the technology with its M-Pesa service - estimates up to 43% of Kenya's GDP now flows through its mobile money channels. This makes Africa the ideal place for Bitcoin to take off, according to Nikunj Handa, chief executive of Ghanaian Bitcoin remittance service Beam, which also charges 3% for transactions. ""Africans are more used to the concept of digital payments and digital cash than those in other developing continents. With the right integrations with the mobile money vendors and the mobile money software, the acquisition, liquidation and hedging of Bitcoin can be made seamless and easy for the African public to adopt,"" he says. BitX's Timothy Stranex agrees that the success of M-Pesa and services like it show that alternative payment systems can work in Africa.  ""It has also shown the role of mobile in next-generation payments. To be successful, alternative forms of payment must  truly be cheaper, faster and more convenient than existing methods,"" he says.  ""They must also leverage mobile. Bitcoin adds to this by also removing the requirement for intermediary service providers."" Bitcoin's growth in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, is not without its challenges.  Mr Stranex says there is an unclear regulatory landscape and financial institutions are very risk averse when it comes to the digital currency.  There are also low levels of liquidity in local Bitcoin markets, though he feels this will change as more Bitcoin-related start-ups begin operations and more consumers start using the currency. Another concern is that the volatility of the digital currency's price could result in a fall in the value of sums sent via Bitcoin. But the remittance companies say this risk is removed by the fact they immediately convert transfers into the currency of the recipient. ""There is no price risk given that we settle instantly. This is our whole selling point,"" says Ms Rossiello. ""Once we are sent Bitcoin, that is instantly changed into local currency and delivered locally. So the price that is shown before the transaction to the customer, is the one the recipient receives."" Igot is the same, according to Mr Day. ""In Kenya, users can immediately convert from Bitcoin to the M-Pesa system, in which it is held as Kenyan shillings,"" he says.  Serial entrepreneur and SiliconCape.com cofounder Vinny Lingham believes the problem is not the price but rather the perception that the price is important when it is not. ""Bitcoin is not a currency, it's the world's first openly traceable digital commodity. Any commodity can be used as a currency, most notably gold, which fluctuates daily,"" he said. ""The value of Bitcoin does not lie in its use as a currency, but rather in its utility as a decentralised trusted public ledger and the applications that can be built upon it."" Technology research company Gartner's David Furlonger says that if Bitcoin can be a catalyst for improving remittance systems this will be a good thing for the entire economy, not just one sector.  But he warns that ""Bitcoins aren't necessarily the panacea to economic development"". ""Clearly the cost of international remittance inhibits enfranchisement of a large part of emerging market populations, and digital currency developments can democratise access to the economy."" ""[But] legislators need to understand the impact of unregulated movements of money and the opacity of remitter/receiver in the bitcoin ecosystem.""

Robert McDowall, the chairman of the Alderney Finance Committee, said it was one of a number of ideas for diversifying the island economy. He was working with the Royal Mint to create the coin that would be gold and tied to the value of a single bitcoin. Royal Mint Chief Executive Adam Lawrence said they did not back the project but declined to explain why. Mr McDowall said he still planned to go ahead with the gold backed coin, but with another jurisdiction like the Isle of Man or Jersey and in a private capacity. He said the coins would have been commemorative and could have been a ""good stream of revenue"" for the island. Alderney and the Royal Mint would have made money from the royalties made on their sale. The coins would contain a set amount of gold, so they could be melted down and sold if the Bitcoin currency collapsed, making investing in Bitcoins potentially safer. ""The funny thing is that if we had done it through Alderney I would not have profited personally [due to my role], now I am able to make money on it myself."" Mr McDowall said he had come up against opposition throughout the project from the States of Guernsey, which is responsible for regulating Alderney. He said: ""Guernsey have claimed it will damage their reputation if we go ahead with this, they are backwards thinking and need to move with the times. This is the future."" Deputy Kevin Stewart, Guernsey's Commerce and Employment Minister, rejected the claims describing them as ""ill judged"" and potentially damaging to Alderney's finance sector. He said while the development of virtual currencies was a ""real opportunity"" for the financial services sector it came with ""very well publicised risks"". Fiona Le Poidevin, Guernsey Finance's chief executive, said the lack of regulation was one area of concern. She said: ""Bitcoin has been associated with some scandal and its very nature means there are risks in terms of the potential for fraud and money laundering.""",0.012614285714285729,0.05883645124716552
176,HSBC severs links with firm behind Bitcoin fund,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-30261976,2014-12-01 15:30:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"HSBC has severed ties with the firm behind the world's first regulated Bitcoin investment fund. Jersey-based hedge fund Global Advisors (GA) claims the bank was worried about ""money laundering risk"". GA's Daniel Masters told the BBC that the development threatens well publicised plans to make Jersey a global centre for digital currencies. HSBC would not discuss individual customers, but said ending a client relationship is never done ""lightly"". Mr Masters said both his firm and the Bitcoin fund are tightly regulated. The States of Jersey has created a company called Digital Jersey, in part to foster financial technology. Island politicians have travelled to Bitcoin conferences to promote Jersey's enthusiasm for digital currencies.   Mr Masters launched the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) in August after it was certified by the Jersey Financial Services Commission. He said HSBC's move was a ""step in the wrong direction for Jersey"". Bitcoin is an online currency founded in 2009, although nobody knows by whom. Each Bitcoin, like other forms of crypto-currencies, is simply a long string of computer code protected by a personal key which provides ownership and security. All Bitcoins in circulation and their transactions histories are recorded in a giant ledger known as the blockchain. This prevents Bitcoins from being spent twice. No middleman is required to verify the transaction, which, say supporters of Bitcoins, makes them quick, secure and cheap to use. Are crypto-currencies the future of money? Unregulated Bitcoin funds exist elsewhere, but the official approval allowed major investors, such as pension and insurance companies, to speculate on Bitcoin for the first time. Having his accounts closed by HSBC is only the latest difficulty faced by GABI, said Mr Masters. He said that when he was launching GABI he could not find any island bank willing to provide services, so took GABI's business elsewhere. Global Advisors has found another Jersey bank, but GABI's banking is not done on the island, although the fund remains registered and regulated in Jersey. Geoff Cook, chief executive of Jersey Finance, said he could not comment on individual cases, but said GABI reflected Jersey's position ""as both a leading hedge fund jurisdiction and a pioneering centre for the rapidly evolving world of fintech (financial technology"". There have been issues around the digital currencies, including a lack of regulation and concerns about the potential for money laundering and other illegal activity. In October 2013 the FBI shut down online marketplace Silk Road, which traded in drugs and other illegal goods and took payments using ""crypto-currencies"". A spokesman for HSBC said: ""We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer."" But he added: ""In reviewing our portfolio, we have identified a number of relationships that don't meet our strategic criteria. ""We don't take the commercial decision to end a customer relationship lightly, and when we do so it follows careful consideration of that relationship in light of our strategic focus or global risk management standards.""",-0.002413043478260878,-0.008126150218541524

Speaking in Singapore, Ms Lagarde said this could make digital currency transactions safer. Non-cash payments have increased over the years, raising challenges for governments and central banks. Regulators have voiced concerns with digital currencies and called for greater oversight.  ""I believe we should consider the possibility to issue digital currency,"" Ms Lagarde said in a speech at a conference in Singapore. ""There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy."" ""The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap and potentially semi-anonymous... And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments."" Ms Lagarde said central banks in Canada, China, Sweden and Uruguay were all ""seriously considering"" digital currency proposals.  A virtual currency issued by a central bank would be a liability of the state - as cash is - not of a private firm. This would help consumers by making transactions safer and more common, and as a result cheaper. ""The more people you serve, the cheaper and more useful the service,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""Private firms may under-invest in security to the extent they do not measure the full cost to society of a payment failure."" She added that while the case for digital currency ""is not universal"" it should be investigated ""seriously, carefully and creatively"".  Although the technology underlying digital assets has been praised for speeding up financial transactions and reducing costs, the anonymity behind cryptocurrency trading has prompted concern among regulators. Ms Lagarde previously said the anonymity of currencies such as Bitcoin means they are used by criminals and terrorists.

178,UK to explore Bitcoin role - George Osborne,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28670414,2014-08-06 13:49:09+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The government is to explore the role that digital currencies such as Bitcoin could play in the financial system and whether they need to be regulated. Chancellor George Osborne has set out measures he said would make Britain the ""global centre of financial innovation"". Bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank but is growing in popularity. Other measures include plans to make it easier for businesses to get loans from sources other than banks. Speaking at the Innovate Finance conference in London, Mr Osborne said the measures would help firms to ""grow and succeed"". Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained. The chancellor said that it was ""only by harnessing innovations in finance, alongside our existing world class knowledge and skills in financial services, that we'll ensure Britain's financial sector continues to meet the diverse needs of businesses and consumers here and around the globe"". As part of the drive, he announced a government investigation into the potential for virtual and digital currencies such as Bitcoin to encourage innovation in the UK's financial sector, while also examining their potential risks. More than 60,000 online retailers now accept virtual currencies worldwide and the growing popularity has seen backers of the currencies push for greater mainstream adoption. However, their use has also been linked to illegal activity online. BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: ""Enthusiasts say it is the future of money, detractors claim that it is extremely volatile and is used mainly by drug dealers and money launderers. ""Now the government says it will examine whether this and other virtual currencies should be regulated, how they could help stimulate innovation - and their potential risks."" Mr Osborne also outlined plans to introduce legislation to help small and medium-sized businesses access alternative sources of finance if they have been turned down for finance by their bank. He said the government would encourage the growth of ""alternative finance providers"" - a major part of the financial and technology, or FinTech sector. Business Secretary Vince Cable said small businesses often ""give up"" applying for finance if they have been turned down by a bank. Stuart Law, chief executive of the alternative finance provider Assetz Capital, said: ""Part of the problem with banks is that they often take several months to approve or reject a loan application. ""As a result, many rejected businesses will have wasted three months already, and will often have missed the opportunity that they needed the money for. ""What is needed is greater awareness of alternative sources of finance at the application stage."" The government will publish a strategy document later this year setting out how it intends to make the UK the global centre of financial innovation.",0.261288,0.026116161616161614

The singling out of the Tesla boss has raised eyebrows because Mr Musk's tweets have often proved controversial. One tweet about taking Tesla private saw him lose his job as chairman, while another has led to a defamation case.  In the live-tweeted interview, Mr Dorsey also said that the way the social network had been handling abuse was ""a huge fail"". Mr Dorsey made his comments during a 90-minute interview with technology news website Recode.  When asked whom he personally thought was exciting and influential on the platform, he wrote: ""I like how @elonmusk uses Twitter. He's focused on solving existential problems and sharing his thinking openly. I respect that a lot and all the ups and downs that come with it."" Elon Musk was happy to take the praise, tweeting: ""Thanks Jack. Twitter rocks.""  But others were less complimentary. ""While lamenting harassment on Twitter, Dorsey praises Tesla CEO, who is being sued for defamation over a tweet,"" wrote one user. Some of Mr Musk's Twitter controversies include: Twitter has been grappling with a range of issues such as how to crack down on fake accounts, election meddling, fake news and bullying on its platform. Shares in Twitter fell 10% this month, with revenue for the first quarter of 2019 expected to be below analyst forecasts. It has also lost users, down to 321 million from 330 million a year earlier. In the Recode interview, Mr Dorsey did not offer any new solutions but admitted that putting the burden on victims to report abuse was not the answer. Asked what grade he would give himself for ""tech responsibility"", he replied: ""Myself? C. We've made progress but it has been scattered and not felt enough. And we've put most of the burden on the victims of abuse (that's a huge fail)."" The public interview was given a dedicated hashtag - #karajack - but some attempting to follow it complained it quickly became confusing and difficult to follow, as more people joined in the conversation. This will not reflect well on Twitter, which has been accused before of not being very user-friendly. Mr Dorsey tweeted: ""OK. Definitely not easy to follow the conversation. Exactly why we are doing this. Fixing stuff like this will help, I believe.""",-0.06817272727272729,0.08351316192225283
180,How do you know where your olive oil really comes from?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47553054,2019-03-22 00:13:05+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"When you pick up a bottle of extra virgin olive oil from the supermarket shelf, how confident are you that it's all that it seems? The olives have had a long journey: from the tree to the mill, where the oil is extracted, which then goes on to the bottling plant before distribution over land and sea to reach the store.  Unfortunately, at any of these stages, it's possible for fakery to creep in.  ""Fraud in the olive oil market has been going on a very long time,"" says Susan Testa, director of culinary innovation at Italian olive oil producer Bellucci.  ""Seed oil is added maybe; or it may contain only a small percentage of Italian oil and have oil from other countries added, while it just says Italian oil on the label."" In February the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) warned that poor olive harvests are likely to lead to a big increase in such adulterated oil this year. And it's far from the only product affected, with the European Union's Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality recently highlighting wine, honey, fish, dairy products, meat and poultry as being frequently faked.  Moreover, 40% of food companies believe traditional methods of countering food fraud aren't working any more, according to research from PwC. Food suppliers, like Bellucci are making efforts to guarantee the provenance of their food themselves, using new tools such as blockchain technology. Best-known for its role in crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, blockchain is a way of keeping records in which each block of data is time-stamped and linked irreversibly to the last, in a way that can't be subsequently altered. That makes it possible to keep a secure record of the product's journey to the supermarket shelf. Since the company was founded in 2013, Bellucci has aimed to build a reputation around the traceability of its oil. Customers can enter the lot number of a particular bottle into an app to see its precise provenance, right back to the groves where the olives were harvested. And over the last year, Bellucci has introduced a blockchain-based system, created by Oracle, to underpin this traceability which it says will make the process more efficient. ""We expect an improvement in the exchange of information throughout the supply chain,"" says Andrea Biagianti, chief information officer for Certified Origins, Bellucci's parent company. ""We would also like the ability [to have] more transparency in the supply chain and the genuine trust of consumers."" IBM's Food Trust network, formally launched late last year, uses similar techniques. ""In the registration phase, you define the product and its properties - for example, the optical spectrum you see when you look at a bottle of whisky,"" explains Andreas Kind, head of blockchain at IBM Research. The appearance of the whisky is precisely recorded within the blockchain, meaning that the description can't later be altered. Then transport companies, border control, storage providers or retailers, can see if the look of the liquid no longer matches the description or ""optical signature"". Meanwhile, labels holding tamper-proof ""cryptoanchors"" are fixed to the bottles. These contain tiny computers holding the product data - encrypted, or encoded, so it can't be tampered with. The labels break when the bottle is opened. Linking the packaging and the product in this way offers a kind of proof says Mr Kind, ""a bit like when you buy a diamond and get a certificate."" IBM is also working with US supermarket chain Walmart, which is rolling out a blockchain-based system that will require all its leafy greens suppliers, along with packing companies and transport operators, to take part. Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba uses blockchain to track food products shipped from Australia and New Zealand; suppliers like New Zealand's largest dairy firm, Fonterra, have adopted the technology. But they go one step further. ""In addition to blockchain technology, the framework will also tag products using QR codes to authenticate, verify, record and provide ongoing reporting throughout the product's lifecycle,"" says Fonterra president for greater China, Christina Zhu. One product Fonterra provides detailed information for is its Anmum infant nutrition range, including the results of factory inspections and product quality sampling tests. But it's not only in the area of tracking supply chains that technology is providing new avenues to approach food fraud. In recent years, there has been progress in identifying food fraud through closer examination of the product itself using DNA analysis. But this approach has one big limitation: to detect an unauthorised ingredient, you have to know what you're looking for. So it's possible to test whether, say, a beef lasagne contains horsemeat, but not to scan a product for unauthorised ingredients without any idea in advance of what it might contain. Now, though, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has developed a new scanning tool that can identify all the ingredients in a product, along with their biological sources. It uses Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - a large-scale testing method that allows whole genomes to be sequenced rapidly.  The FSAI has tested the scanner on 45 random samples and found that four contained plant species that weren't listed on the label.  More Technology of Business One of them was mustard - a known allergen that should always be declared. ""We don't have to wait for tip-offs any more,"" says Dr Patrick O'Mahoney, chief specialist, food science and technology at the FSIA. Nevertheless he cautions against interpreting the results too literally. ""As regulators, we have to be pragmatic about what could be a labelling error rather than food fraud,"" he says. ""We go for the ones where there's an obvious financial benefit for somebody."" Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook",0.05914324324324325,0.10723626223626223

It was assumed that the name behind Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, was a pseudonym for the group of coders who developed the system. Now Newsweek claims Dorian S Nakamoto, a 64-year-old model train enthusiast who lives on the outskirts of Los Angeles, is the creator. However, he denied his involvement in an interview with the Associated Press. Mr Nakamoto said he hadn't heard of the cryptocurrency until his son told him about it after being contacted by a reporter. By Puneet Pal SinghBusiness reporter, BBC News, New York For someone who claims to have unmasked arguably the most elusive man in the technology sector right now, Leah Goodman appeared to be relatively calm. Her story on the Bitcoin inventor has not only generated a lot of buzz but also a fair share of controversy. While she admitted that it was fine for people to question the evidence as being circumstantial, she defended her decision to publish the story. She said she had directly asked the man she claims as being the inventor of the digital currency if he denied ever being involved with Bitcoins.  According to her: ""He couldn't do that... he didn't want to talk about it. ""That was the important part, the meeting and asking him are you this man, that was key to the story to me, because that was his opportunity, of course, to say 'no I am not'."" When asked if he admitted being the inventor, she said: ""He certainly didn't say 'you got me'."" So for now, just like the digital currency he is said to have invented, Satoshi Nakamoto's  'discovery' continues to remain controversial.   In the article, Newsweek reporter Leah Goodman said she tracked Mr Nakamoto down by seeking public records for US citizens bearing that name. She then investigated people whose background, education and employment history showed they might be capable of creating the crypto-currency. Ms Goodman's enquiries focussed on one candidate in particular who seemed to have the right profile and whose involvement was hinted at by other Bitcoin developers.  Further evidence, she said, arose when talking to his family members revealed his obsession with privacy, his political leanings and his facility with maths.  The evidence led Ms Goodman to confront Mr Nakamoto at his home where she asked if he was the creator of Bitcoin.  Many Bitcoin commentators on social networks have expressed scepticism about the find saying the evidence Ms Goodman gathered was not convincing. The story was called ""fake"" by some commentators on the Bitcoin Talk forum who demanded Mr Nakamoto carry out signed Bitcoin transactions to prove that he was the currency's originator. Others criticised Newsweek for publishing a picture of Mr Nakamoto and revealing so much about his life. On Twitter, Ms Goodman said the magazine had only printed information that was publicly available.",0.0072666666666666695,0.06813509242080669

The application was made in Japan by lawyers acting on behalf of the exchange and comes only days after MtGox went offline. On Tuesday, the exchange's boss said he was working hard to find a ""solution to our recent issues"". Before going offline, technical troubles meant it prevented customers transferring digital cash to other exchanges on 7 February. Details of the bankruptcy are scant but the application for protection has been accepted by a district court in Tokyo, reported AFP. At the court hearing, the company said it had outstanding debts of about 6.5bn yen (£38m). MtGox's lawyers are believed to have decided to apply to the court for protection after US regulators filed a subpoena against the company. Reports suggested the site shut down after it discovered that an estimated 744,000 bitcoins - about $350m (£210m) - had been stolen due to a loophole in its security. MtGox's troubles have put pressure on the price bitcoin owners can get for their holdings.

The exchange has been hit by technical issues and recently halted all customer withdrawals of the digital currency after it spotted what it called ""unusual activity"". The move is a setback for backers of Bitcoin, who have been pushing for greater adoption of the currency.  Meanwhile, six other major Bitcoin exchanges issued a joint statement distancing themselves from MtGox. By Robert PestonBusiness editor  The move by MtGox to halt withdrawals had resulted in a sharp decline in the value of Bitcoin. A statement was posted on the MtGox website on Tuesday afternoon. ""In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly,"" it said. The closure of the site did not ""reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin"", said a statement from representatives of several other Bitcoin exchanges, including Coinbase and BTC China. ""This tragic violation of the trust of users of MtGox was the result of one company's actions.  ""As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today.   ""We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfil the promise that Bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age,"" they added. MtGox halted transfers of the digital currency to external addresses on 7 February. The Tokyo-based firm said it had found a loophole that thieves could use to fool the transaction process into sending double the correct number of Bitcoins.  The issue also left it vulnerable to attacks, which slowed down the rate at which coins could be bought and sold. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned. The loophole was also thought to have been exploited by thieves, who stole about $2.7m in Bitcoins from the Silk Road 2 website earlier this month. However, last week, the exchange said that customers would be able to starts withdrawals ""soon"". One report claimed on Monday that the exchange had become ""insolvent"" after losing 744,408 Bitcoins - worth about $350m (£210m) at Monday's trading prices. The chief executive of MtGox, Mark Karpeles, told Reuters in an email on Tuesday: ""We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell you much more for now, as this also involves other parties.""  Unlike real currencies, Bitcoins are not regulated by any central bank or government financial institutions. They are created as part of a technique called ""mining"", which is used to process transactions. With only a limited number or Bitcoins in circulation, their price has risen significantly in recent months driven by a variety of factors.  Some have been betting that the digital currency may get the backing of regulators as a legitimate financial service and have been investing in it. Their popularity has also been driven in part by it being difficult to trace transactions carried out using Bitcoins, and the currency has been linked to illegal activity online. Its growing popularity has seen backers of the currency push for greater mainstream adoption. They have had some success with a few firms starting to accept Bitcoins as a form of payment.  However, there have also been concerns over the currency's long-term future, not least due to a lack of proper regulation and laws.  At the same time, some have warned that the rapid surge in Bitcoin's price was merely due to speculation and was not sustainable.  The latest development with MtGox is likely to trigger fresh concerns over the digital currency. However, other Bitcoin backers said they were working together to ""re-establish"" trust among users and were ""committed to the future of Bitcoin"". They said they ""will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner"".",0.07345,0.048757679609952344

The Tokyo-based firm said its investigation into the unusual activity revealed a loophole that thieves could use to fool the transaction process into sending double the correct number of bitcoins.  It also left it vulnerable to attacks, which slowed down the rate at which coins could be bought and sold. This problem revolved around what are known as bitcoin wallets - an essential part of the entire bitcoin system and the place where bitcoin addresses - the virtual post-boxes where each bitcoin is stored - are kept. Cash withdrawals and transfers of bitcoins to - rather than from - bitcoin wallets were unaffected by the loophole. The suspension of withdrawals led some bitcoin traders to travel to Japan to confront MTGox's staff and demand the return of their currency. The loophole was also thought to have been exploited by thieves, who stole about $2.7m in bitcoins from the Silk Road 2 website. In a statement, MTGox said it had found a way to combat the loophole by issuing unique identifiers for each transaction. This, it said, should prevent ""fraudulent"" abuse of the transaction process.

187,Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45526365,2018-09-14 16:24:20+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"If you believe crypto-currencies are the future this has not been a good week. The value of Ethereum, Bitcoin's main rival and ""the future of crypto"" not so long ago, has lurched ever lower and is now 80% below its peak.  Meanwhile, US regulators have acted against companies involved in crypto-currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) - schemes to create new coins. But hope springs eternal, and in recent days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted me about plans to allow their customers to pay with crypto-currencies.  So on this week's Tech Tent we debate this question: has crypto-currency peaked or do its best days lie ahead? We invited David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, a very sceptical take on the crypto landscape, to debate with Christopher Shake, the director of that London gallery, The House of Fine Art. The gallery's press release had boasted that it was about to run ""the very first art exhibition only available through crypto-currency"".  By the time Mr Shake arrived in our studio that had changed slightly - customers would be encouraged to buy the 500 works in the October exhibition in Bitcoin or a range of other digital currencies but if they wanted to use good old-fashioned dollars or pounds, such payment would be accepted. ""Our main goal is to support and promote our artists,"" he says. But as a crypto-currency enthusiast, he explains that there is also problem he wants to solve: people sitting on big crypto assets aren't able to spend them. ""If a lot of merchants do jump on and accept crypto-currencies, that will add confidence to the market,"" he explains. But David Gerard says things are moving in the opposite direction - fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies because they are so volatile and the promise of smooth cost-free transactions has proved illusory.  He says many left during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. ""You couldn't trust it for volatility, you couldn't trust it because transactions were slow and often didn't go through at all. It really destroyed the use-case for the general merchant acceptance of cryptos."" He sums up his view of the whole crypto market: ""It's not really very interesting or shiny any more."" But Christopher Shake sees it very differently. He claims that everyone from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook is now moving into crypto-currencies - something David Gerard says just isn't the case - and he believes it is an idea whose time has come. ""It is sticking around because it has value. It's sticking around because it's a great technology, and that's why institutions are getting into it."" But for all his reservations, David Gerard does not expect Bitcoin in particular to disappear in a hurry. ""Bitcoin has spent its entire existence lurching from crisis to crisis, any of which would have killed a sane financial instrument,"" he says. ""But Bitcoin is more of a strong cultist advocate thing for people who are into it.""  His forecast is that crypto-currency will slowly become more regulated and normalised - a rather different vision from that of the early Bitcoin advocates, who saw it smashing the system and making central banks and governments irrelevant. Also on this programme, we look at Apple's new health-focused Watch and ask whether doctors will be flooded with patients worried about what its ECG monitor is telling them. And we get two opposing views on whether the EU's proposed new copyright law is good for artists or will lead to a censored internet.  ",0.1374090909090909,0.13763659320477498

Zynga is perhaps the most significant video games firm to accept bitcoins to date. The virtual currency has been gaining in popularity but its value has been highly volatile in recent weeks.  It peaked at $1,250 in November last year, but fell sharply in December after China restricted trade. According to the South China Morning Post, the value of a single Bitcoin fell to as low as 2,560 yuan ($421, £258) in December, after China's move. On Monday, a single Bitcoin was trading close to $1,030 on MTGox, one of the virtual currency's major exchanges. Zynga follows Ouya, the Android-based video games console-maker, which began accepting payments for its hardware in bitcoins last month. The Humble Bundle - an organisation selling a changing selection of indie games - also began accepting bitcoins in 2013.  Supporters of Bitcoin, which is not backed by a central bank, have been pushing for its increased usage. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. Like many assets its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. Its popularity and value surged last year after a US Senate committee described virtual currencies as a ""legitimate financial service"". Zynga said it had tied up with BitPay, a Bitcoin payment service, to allow users to purchase virtual goods in some of its games using the facility. ""In response to Bitcoin's rise in popularity around the world, Zynga, with help from BitPay, is testing expanded payment options for players to make in-game purchases using Bitcoin,"" the firm said in a post on Reddit. Concerns over the use and risks associated the virtual currency have also grown.  Bitcoin became popular, in part, due to it being difficult to trace transactions that use it. The currency has been linked to illegal activity online. Last month, the European Banking Authority (EBA) warned the public about the potential risks of using bitcoins.  ""Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the European Union that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,"" the EBA said. China, the world's second largest economy, has also banned its banks from handling Bitcoin transactions, saying they had no legal status and should not be used as a currency. At the same time, there have been concerns that the rise in Bitcoin's value has been triggered by speculators looking to cash in on its popularity. Alan Greenspan, former US Federal Reserve chairman, has called the rapid rise a ""bubble"".",0.13589999999999997,0.029041879837334382

In return for ending the class action, the former customers will share 16.5% of Sunlot - the company that has applied to buy and administer MtGox's assets.

The conclusion emerged from a study of the web activity and social media chatter surrounding the virtual currency by Swiss computer scientists. Their analysis of who was taking part in this activity helped to explain the meteoric rise in the value of bitcoins.  It might also offer insights into how online communities adapt and grow, suggested the research team. Bitcoin was a great candidate for research because so much of the activity surrounding it takes place online, wrote the team in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society.  Bitcoins are a virtual currency which depend on people using their computers to both generate the cyber coins and to verify transactions carried out with them.  Currently one bitcoin can be exchanged for $585 (£347). Studying the ""digital traces"" of this activity could help lay bare the variables that govern the way the virtual currency behaves said the team. The four key variables that emerged from the analysis were:  From this the team at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich managed to find two positive feedback loops that steadily influence how much each bitcoin was worth.  The first ""reinforcement cycle"" involves an increase in the amount of searching for information about bitcoins, which leads to more chatter about the currency and prompts a rise in its value.  ""The successive price surges in the Bitcoin economy are largely due to its growing public attention,"" said the team. The second feedback loop involves a rise in search volume which makes more people download the software and join in the mining pools that generate coins. This too tends to lead to a rise in the nominal value of Bitcoins. ""Our analysis suggests that the successive waves of growth of the Bitcoin economy were driven by corresponding waves of new users from public circles gradually opening to the currency"" wrote the researchers. In addition, they found found that search spikes were early indicators of an imminent drop in its value but added that this did not act as a good predictor of the biggest falls in the value of bitcoins.

191,Alderney Bitcoin currency 'a reputational risk',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-25206843,2013-12-04 11:13:52+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A plan to mint money based on the virtual currency Bitcoin could damage the Bailiwick of Guernsey's reputation, Guernsey Finance has warned. Robert McDowall, Alderney's Finance Committee chairman, has been in talks with the Royal Mint about producing coins based on the online money. He said commemorative coins brought ""a good stream of revenue"". Fiona Le Poidevin, Guernsey Finance's chief executive, said the lack of regulation was one area of concern. She said the Bitcoin concept had become ""increasingly familiar, but it is still in its infancy and this brings with it both challenges and opportunities"". Ms Le Poidevin said the Bailiwick's reputation for high standards was important in generating more business for the islands and needed to be protected. Mr McDowall said the idea came out of discussions with the Royal Mint and he dismissed concerns about the reputation of the virtual currency. He said if it went ahead it would involve a commemorative coin being issued by the Royal Mint with the Bitcoin logo on one side and the Alderney logo on the other. The coins would contain a set amount of gold, so they could be melted down and sold if the Bitcoin currency collapsed. Upon travelling to the island, anyone with an Alderney Bitcoin would be able to exchange it for either the virtual currency or the sterling value of a Bitcoin at the time. Alderney and the Royal Mint would make money from the royalties made on the sale of the coins. Previous coins have marked the total eclipse in 1999, the history of the Royal Navy, Concorde's last flight, the 50th anniversary of the Mini, what would have been the 70th birthday of John Lennon and the engagement of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Mr McDowall said: ""Part of Alderney's initiative to generate more revenue for the island is looking at what activities it can exploit. ""Amongst those we have a good stream of revenue from issuing commemorative coins."" Some financial commentators have suggested the plans could be a bid to create an international centre for the online currency and even introduce regulation for the increasing popular virtual currency. Mr McDowall said this was not something being discussed at the moment. He said: ""It gives a certain respectability to Bitcoin and it gives a physical appearance. It's quite a novel issue commemorative coin. ""There's a lot of fuss about this and I don't know why."" He said he did not expect the coins to be bought for anything other than ""novelty value"" by collectors and those in the computer industry. Ms Le Poidevin said: ""Bitcoin has been associated with some scandal and its very nature means there are risks in terms of the potential for fraud and money laundering."" The value of the online currency fell steeply after a large amount of it was seized in the closure of the website Silk Road, which had been used to trade illegal drugs, and in August security concerns were identified in certain apps used to store the currency. Ms Le Poidevin said: ""We are in an ever-changing world... therefore if the Bailiwick can play a part in addressing concerns by developing the currency, including its regulation, then that could be very positive. ""In turn we may enhance our image as an innovative place to do business and may even be recognised as a leading jurisdiction in the field but any move in this direction may need to carry the label 'proceed with caution'."" Guernsey Finance is responsible for promoting the island's finance industry to international clients. The Guernsey Financial Services Commission, which is responsible for regulating the finance industry in the Bailiwick, said it was considering the ""complex policy and regulatory issues"" associated with virtual currency with the States Policy Council and the Law Officers. In a statement it said: ""Those discussions are ongoing with a view to developing an appropriate and informed policy response which will necessarily take into account the inherent reputational risks."" The move to create the coins needs the approval of the States of Alderney.",0.20705000000000004,0.13372594997594997

Many worried the crackdown would cause the value to plummet, but instead growing confidence that regulators will not imminently seek to ban the currency has seen its price soar. Enthusiasts say it is a highly efficient way of handling global money transfers. ""For Bitcoin to go from zero to $1,000 in just five years has been amazing to watch,"" said Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer. ""It's easy to forget that Bitcoin's true value is not in an arbitrary exchange rate, but in its ability to enable new applications and services which aren't possible with today's payment networks."" The US Senate hearing earlier this month was prompted by the closure of the Silk Road. Representatives from the Department of Justice and financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission were asked to provide their views about virtual currencies to the committee, and submissions have been received from the FBI and the US Federal Reserve. ""Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of the rest of us,"" the chairman of the committee, senator Thomas Carper, said in opening remarks. The FBI, in a letter to the committee, said that it recognised virtual currencies offered ""legitimate financial services"" but they could be ""exploited by malicious actors"". By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent It has been an extraordinary year for the currency, which attracts disciples and detractors in similar numbers.   Back in January, when only a dedicated band of libertarians and  uber-geeks knew much about it, one bitcoin was worth under $20 - but as people began writing about its attractions, the value soared.  Then in October when the FBI closed down the Silk Road, the online drugs marketplace where Bitcoin was the main means of exchange, it tumbled over 20% in a few hours.  But last week, it was given the stamp of respectability when a US Senate hearing heard glowing testimony about its potential, with officials from President Barack Obama administration comparing its merits with those of the internet.  There is now growing knowledge of and interest in Bitcoin among law enforcement officials, regulators and economists. And while there remains much scepticism about its security, the idea of a virtual currency for the internet has taken root.  But investors beware - anyone who gets on the bandwagon can be guaranteed a bumpy rise.  Mythili Raman, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, told the committee: ""We have seen increasing use of such currencies by drug dealers, traffickers of child pornography, and perpetrators of large-scale fraud schemes."" But Bitcoin is slowly starting to be used for other, more legitimate means.  In October, the world's first Bitcoin ATM opened in Vancouver, Canada - the machine allows users to exchange bitcoins for cash and vice-versa. Although one entire bitcoin may be worth $1,000, it is possible to pay for goods using fractions of bitcoins.  For example, pizzaforcoins.com offers two pizzas for 0.02160 bitcoins. The value of Bitcoin has fluctuated throughout the past year. In January, it was trading at about $20. In April, a panic sell-off meant the value of one bitcoin went from $260 to $130 in just a few hours. Trading exchange MTGox said it had struggled to handle a ""rather astonishing"" sudden influx of new users. The virtual currency has also been quickly adopted in China, where one exchange - BTC China - is said to be the most active globally. Bitcoin's use in China has been attributed to it being an effective way of reliably getting money out of the country. Various Bitcoin exchanges have been set up around the world, with MTGox being the most prominent. Typically, each exchange will show a different value - this is due to the difficulty in exchanging bitcoins for real currency, a process that can require the funds to be transferred through several banks in different countries. Each bank would probably charge a fee for these transactions. Bitcoin's volatility has provoked calls from some to not refer to it as a ""currency"" at all, and that it instead should be referred to as a stock or commodity.",0.12920425531914895,0.09193198448517596
193,The Bitcoin bungler - a salutary tale,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25120902,2013-11-27 12:13:57+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Here's a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of climbing aboard the Bitcoin bandwagon. You could lose your entire investment in a moment of carelessness. Then again, you would have to be as daft and forgetful as me. Here's how it happened. Back in the spring I acquired some Bitcoins - well about half a Bitcoin - to carry out an experiment on behalf of Radio 4's PM programme. I wanted to see how easy it was to use the virtual currency to buy something real - in this case a pizza.  My mission succeeded, although I found it quite a tricky and cumbersome process. I first needed to set up a Bitcoin wallet on a mobile phone, then acquire some currency, paying for it on an exchange using a mobile money app. But having succeeded in getting my lunch delivered, I decided to top up my Bitcoin balance again, so that I still had 0.5 Btc in my mobile wallet. A few months later I went to a conference about the currency, where I tried out the world's first Bitcoin ATM, putting in £10 and topping up my account to 0.7Btc. So now I had about £43 at that day's exchange rate. At the conference I winced sympathetically when an early adopter explained how he'd lost 7,000 Bitcoins (then $200,000) because he hadn't backed up his private key to his computer. For months, I thought little about the small investment sitting in an app on my phone. Then I looked at the Bitcoin exchange rate - now pushing towards $900 in the latest extraordinary bubble - and realised it had turned into a rather big investment. But then I remembered what I'd done with the phone containing the currency. Wanting to make sure it was somewhere I could get easier access, I'd transferred almost my entire Bitcoin holding to a new wallet on another phone that I was testing back in the summer. Then, a few weeks ago, I offered this phone - supplied by the manufacturer - as a prize in a charity fundraising effort. And before handing it over to the winner I had of course restored it to factory settings, wiping all of my personal data and apps, including my Bitcoin Wallet. So my Bitcoin holding - now worth upwards of £400 - had vanished into thin air. The record of the transaction sending 0.7 Btc to the wiped phone was still on the original handset, and when I tapped on the app up came a message: ""If you lose your device you lose your Bitcoins. This means you need to back up your private keys!"" Of course, I had not done that. so my money had disappeared into the void - and as Bitcoin is by its nature an unregulated currency with no central bank or ombudsmen, there was nobody to whom  I could appeal for advice or recompense.  A salutary tale then - but for me a worthwhile lesson in understanding the mechanics of a virtual currency. And I've two sources of comfort - first of all, the man at that conference who lost 7,000 Bitcoins is now down about $6m (£3.7m) by today's exchange rate. And secondly, there is every possibility that we will see that exchange rate plunge again in the coming weeks - so our respective Bitcoin bungles may not matter so much in the long run.",0.10560400000000002,0.07444696969696969

In new guidance, HM Revenue & Customs also said it would not levy the 20% tax on the creation, or so-called 'mining', of the virtual currency. The move comes just days after the collapse of leading Bitcoin exchange, MtGox, and with it the loss of almost $500m (£300m) in customer deposits. HMRC said corporation and income taxes would still apply. The global market for Bitcoins, a virtual currency created, or 'mined' through complicated computer algorithms, is worth about $7 billion (£4.2bn) at current market rates. Countries and their tax authorities have been grappling with how to regulate it, with some seeing it as a route for tax evasion or money laundering.   Russia has declared transactions illegal, China has banned its banks from handling Bitcoin trades, and there have been calls for the US to do the same. Singapore has imposed a tax on Bitcoin trading and using it to pay for services, after classifying it as goods, rather than a currency. However, HMRC's guidance issued on Monday, said VAT would not be levied, on the basis of EU rules that apply to currencies. It said Bitcoin trading and other activities, like charges for verifying transactions, ""are exempt because they fall within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments'"". Bitcoin traders and supporters had been calling for HMRC to scrap its VAT plans for the currency, arguing it would make their businesses globally uncompetitive, or even unviable. But VAT will apply to suppliers of goods and services sold in exchange for Bitcoin, based on the sterling value of the virtual currency at the point of sale, HMRC said. And the profits or losses of companies using Bitcoins, and on exchange movements between currencies, will be subject to corporation tax, the government agency added. Last month leading Bitcoin exchange, Tokyo-based MtGox, filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins. It said there was a ""high probability"" the Bitcoins had been stolen. The currency has been highly volatile since its inception, and particularly in the last year. The price of one Bitcoin stands at about $658, down from a peak of $1,242 in December.",-0.04738235294117648,-0.01766488413547237
198,Jersey group in campaign to create 'Bitcoin Isle',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-27921445,2014-06-23 08:06:15+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A campaign has been launched to make Jersey a world leader in digital currencies.   Bitcoin payments are already accepted in a handful of places but an industry expert says, if the States allow banks to accept and trade with it, Jersey could become a magnet for new business. Robbie Andrews, of bit.coin.je, an industry body set up to promote and campaign for the currency, wants to create a ""Bitcoin Isle"". Treasury Minister Senator Philip Ozouf said he wanted Jersey to be an early leader in the field. There have been issues around the digital currency, including a lack of regulation and concerns over potential for money laundering and other illegal activity. Bitcoin was founded in 2009 although nobody knows by whom, only that they took the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Each Bitcoin, like other forms of crypto-currencies, is simply a long string of computer code protected by a personal key which provides both ownership and security. All Bitcoins in circulation and their transactions histories are recorded in a giant ledger known as the blockchain. This prevents each Bitcoin from being spent twice. No middleman is required to verify the transaction so they are quick, secure and cheap to use. Are crypto-currencies the future of money? In October 2013 the FBI shut down online marketplace Silk Road. The site traded in drugs and other illegal goods and took payments using ""crypto-currencies"" such as Bitcoin. In December 2013, Fiona Le Poidevin, Chief Executive of Guernsey Finance, said the current lack of regulation was an area of concern. She said the Bitcoin concept had become ""increasingly familiar, but it is still in its infancy and this brings with it both challenges and opportunities"". Senator Ozouf said: ""[This] is a sector that could hold significant opportunities for Jersey.  ""Our infrastructure of world-class financial services and digital expertise gives us the tools to be an early leader in the field. Innovation will be central to Jersey's future prosperity.  ""We are keen to support local businesses by helping to create a well-regulated and responsive environment for investment in the sector."" Early in 2014 the Chinese government said Bitcoin was not a currency and banned financial institutions from dealing with Bitcoin exchanges.  BBC chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, said: ""It is clear that regulators around the world are unsure about what to make of Bitcoin and are still in the process of making up their mind if and how it and other crypto-currencies should be regulated."" Mr Andrews said Bitcoin was vital to the future of Jersey's economy and would be used globally. ""In the same way email changed how we send files globally, Bitcoin will change how we transact our lives. It is a network you can use for payment that is global and not managed by one industry body."" He said he would like to see more places accept payment in digital currency. ""My plan would be that you get the bus and pay using your phone. You get the paper, you pay with your phone. And at no point do you constantly give people your credit card details."" Tiffin tearoom on St Helier's waterfront already accepts Bitcoin. Owner Giles Day said: ""It is fast, reliable and a very secure payment method. It is the way of the future. It is what the digital and finance industry will be using and those two industries are key to Jersey. ""With a credit card, we get charged and it takes a while to get the money. We get Bitcoins into our account straight away, without any charges."" Mr Andrews said the next step would be Bitcoin banking, meaning workers would get paid in Bitcoins. ""That would require new legislation and the States need to act quickly if they want to capitalise on it,"" he said. ""At the moment there is a big push for a digital industry in Jersey to grow and if you asked any technologist what is the one technology that fits between technology and finance, it would be a crypto-currency like Bitcoin.""",0.1909903225806452,0.06170576735092865

It comes shortly after MtGox halted transfers of the digital currency to external addresses after it spotted what it called ""unusual activity"". The halt resulted in a sharp decline in the value of Bitcoins. Last week, MtGox - one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges - said customers should be able withdraw funds ""soon"". Meanwhile, all tweets on MtGox's Twitter account have also been deleted. The Bitcoin Foundation said that Mr Karpeles's resignation would be ""effective immediately"". It is the foundation's second high-profile resignation in the past month.  Another board member, Charles Shrem, stepped down in late January after being arrested and charged with money laundering in connection with his Bitcoin company.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million Bitcoins in existence. To receive a Bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned. Mr Shrem, the chief executive of New York-based Bitcoin exchange BitInstant, has pleaded not guilty.  The issues with MtGox had sparked a dispute between the exchange and the Bitcoin Foundation. The Tokyo-based firm said that its investigation into the unusual activity revealed a loophole that could be exploited to fool the transaction process into sending double the correct number of Bitcoins. It also left it vulnerable to attacks, which slowed down the rate at which coins could be bought and sold.  As it halted the withdrawals, MtGox had suggested that a flaw in the virtual currency's underlying software was to blame for the problem. ""A bug in the Bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of Bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur,"" it had said in a statement. ""Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the Bitcoins may be resent."" However, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, denied the problem was its fault. ""The issues that MtGox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between MtGox's highly customised wallet software, their customer support procedures, and an obscure (but long-known) quirk in the way transactions are identified and not due to a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol,"" he told the BBC earlier this month.",-0.037365517241379306,0.070601590618832

The crypto-currency was seized by the FBI during a raid in October on the internet marketplace Silk Road. The seized bitcoins are part of the civil forfeiture and criminal action brought against Silk Road owner Ross William Ulbrich. The ""gaffe"" was revealed by CoinDesk, an online website dedicated to bitcoin news. It said that it has a list of people who inquired about the auction. It includes Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a UK payment processor. ""The US Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to individuals who had enquired about bidding in the Silk Road Bitcoin auction informing that a new FAQ had been published on the USMS website. However, the recipient list was accidentally exposed because it was copied rather than blind copied,"" reporter Joon Wong told the BBC. The information revealed is not the definitive list of registered bidders so in that respect it is not a significant breach, said Mr Wong. ""It is more significant in terms of giving us an insight into the agency handling this auction,"" he said. ""The USMS is the first government agency to conduct a crypto-currency auction.

The firm will initially accept the virtual currency for hotel bookings only, and is currently restricting the trial to its US site. But one Bitcoin watcher told the BBC this was ""a big move"" for the currency.  Expedia's announcement comes after a turbulent few months for Bitcoin, which has been plagued by security concerns.

A number of smaller online travel sites already accept virtual currencies, including Travel Keys and CheapAir, but Expedia is the first company of its size to adopt Bitcoin. Emily Spaven, managing editor of Bitcoin news site CoinDesk, told the BBC the move was ""brilliant news"" and it ""brings digital currency further into the consciousness of the mainstream"".  In a statement, Expedia's global vice-president, Michael Gulmann, said the company was ""in a unique position"" to ""solve travel planning and booking for our customers and partners alike by adopting the latest payment technologies"". Expedia will use Bitcoin exchange Coinbase for processing transactions, but Mr Gulmann told the Wall Street Journal that the firm would not hold the currency, but would convert its Bitcoin deposits back into US dollars every 24 hours.  However, as Ms Spaven points out, ""that's what most of the big companies are doing, because [the price of] Bitcoin is still massively volatile"". Bitcoin, which is the world's most prominent crypto-currency, has been the subject of much controversy in recent months. The collapse of Japanese Bitcoin exchange MtGox, following a number of security breaches, harmed the currency's reputation, and there have been several controversies surrounding taxation of transactions made with Bitcoin. But, the digital currency took another step closer to the mainstream this week, with both Google and Yahoo adding its conversion price to its financial tools.  More than 60,000 online retailers now accept bitcoins worldwide. ",0.14484444444444444,0.12855780022446692
202,YouTube's copyright claim system abused by extorters,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47227937,2019-02-14 10:37:47+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Google has removed a YouTube channel after it was found to be abusing copyright claims to extort money from users. Kenzo and ObbyRaidz, whose channels predominantly feature them playing Minecraft, reported receiving messages demanding money in exchange for dropping two claims against them. These messages threatened that refusal to pay would result in a third copyright ""strike"", which, according to Google, results in a YouTube channel being ""subject to termination"". The extorter's YouTube account has been deleted after the illegal activity was made public. Kenzo and ObbyRaidz both received messages demanding payment ranging from $75 to $400 (£58 to £309) be sent via Paypal or Bitcoin. Neither paid and British YouTuber Kenzo, who has 60,000 subscribers, took to social media to plead for help after one of his videos was taken down by the extorter's second fraudulent copyright strike,  In its response to Kenzo's tweet, YouTube said both of the copyright claims against him had been ""obviously abusive"" and it had reinstated his video to its platform. ""This is an example of a fraudulent legal request, which we have zero tolerance for,"" it said in a statement. ""We [have] terminated [the extorter's] channel."" Google, which owns YouTube, did not respond to a request for information regarding how YouTube intended to prevent such extortion attempts in the future. A successful ""copyright takedown notification"" results in a video being removed and the infringing YouTube channel receiving a copyright strike. To make such a claim, an individual must provide their contact information and a description of the copyright they say has been infringed by the video in question. The applicant must also accept possible legal consequences for ""false or bad faith"" allegations of copyright infringement. But US-based YouTuber ObbyRaidz has now called the system ""broken"", in a video posted to his YouTube channel. ""Anybody can do it,"" he said. ""They made it so easy to take somebody's channel down - they strike a few videos and your channel is terminated. ""The way I look at it, YouTube just put a Band-Aid on a much bigger issue,"" he said, referring to the deletion of the extorter's account. ""This is something that can affect more channels in the future and they need to fix this right now."" YouTube has come under fire for its Content ID system, which automatically determines whether a video contains copyrighted material. This system was criticised in 2018 after it resulted in a YouTuber receiving a copyright infringement notice for including his own song in a video. A copyright takedown notification, in contrast, results from an application submitted to YouTube by an individual. These claims, however, do not necessarily lead to a takedown and a strike being placed on a channel. For example, an individual can choose to make a copyright claim that, if successful, keeps a video online but directs any ad revenue towards the original copyright holder. This type of copyright claim is becoming increasingly commonplace, with YouTuber MrBeast - who has more than 14.8 million subscribers - revealing that five of his most recent videos have all been demonetised under such claims.",-0.1105761904761905,0.07238347190728144
203,Bitcoin exchange halts withdrawals after cyber-attack,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26155157,2014-02-12 13:49:01+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitstamp - one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges - has halted withdrawals after coming under cyber-attack. The Slovenia-based firm said the culprits had exploited a bug in the virtual currency's underlying software to carry out the assault. It is the second exchange to suspend operations. Tokyo's MtGox took a similar measure on Friday. A third, Bulgaria's BTC-e, has warned that some transactions may be delayed. Like Bitstamp, it cited a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as the cause. The Bitcoin Foundation - a group of developers who maintain and promote the cryptographic code on which the currency relies - said that it was creating workarounds and fixes to tackle the issue. It added that people who had funds stored with the affected exchanges should know that their savings were safe, albeit ""tied up"" for the time being. ""This is a denial-of-service attack; whoever is doing this is not stealing coins, but is succeeding in preventing some transactions from confirming,"" wrote Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the foundation. ""It's important to note that DoS attacks do not affect people's Bitcoin wallets or funds."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.

These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. The cause of the problem is an issue called transaction malleability. It involves someone changing the cryptographic code - known as a transaction hash - used to create an ID for the exchange of funds before it is recorded in the blockchain - a database of every transaction carried out in the currency. On Monday, MtGox had suggested that this technique could be used to fool its systems into repeatedly making a payout because it would seem that it had not occurred. The Bitcoin Foundation's initial response was that transaction malleability had been known about since 2011, and that MtGox should have prepared for this when developing its own customised software, which was now proving vulnerable. ""This is something that cannot be corrected overnight,"" wrote Mr Andresen. But while other exchanges are not complaining about the risk of making unauthorised payouts, it appears their systems can become overwhelmed if they receive too many ""mutated versions"" of the transaction IDs. ""This is a denial-of-service attack made possible by some misunderstandings in Bitcoin wallet implementations,"" said Bitstamp's blog. ""These misunderstandings have simple solutions that are being implemented as we speak, and we're confident everything will be back to normal shortly."" The Bitcoin Foundation now says its members and developers from a number of exchanges are working ""collectively and collaboratively"" to tackle the problem and allow withdrawals to resume. One bitcoin is currently trading for about $665 (£402). That is well below the $830 level it was at last Thursday, reflecting investors' concern at the news. However, one expert said the virtual currency should emerge from the attacks more robust than before. ""Obviously it's a bit more serious than was initially thought - it was originally believed that it was just a problem at MtGox because of the way they had set up their systems,"" Emily Spaven, editor of the news site Coindesk, told the BBC. ""The view from developers is that the exchanges should be processing bitcoin withdrawals again within 48-72 hours, though the wider issue of transaction malleability will take longer to address. ""It's been a bit of a wake-up call to get this issue fixed. I suppose they previously thought it wasn't that big a deal.""",0.01101111111111113,0.08381944444444443

The University said it hoped that the acceptance of Bitcoins on these courses would lead to ""learning by doing"". A system for processing the payments is already operational. Cumbria is thought to be the first public university in the world to accept the currency, although a private one in Cyprus announced last year that it would do so. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each of the millions of Bitcoins currently in existence is represented by a unique online registration number. To receive a Bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post box.

From the high of $260 (£169) for each bitcoin on 10 April, bitcoins are now worth less than $100 (£65) each. The main bitcoin exchange shut down for 12 hours to install hardware to help it cope with trading volumes. In addition, malicious software is emerging that seeks out and empties the virtual wallets of bitcoin owners. MTGox, on which most bitcoin trading takes place, was overwhelmed earlier this week by the amount of people who joined the exchange to trade the virtual cash. The computer problems prompted a round of panic selling that forced values to plunge. The exchange went offline to beef up its hardware to cope with trading volumes and stem the fall in value. However, soon after trading resumed the site came under a sustained hack attack which saw it bombarded with data. In a tweet, MTGox said the it was being hit by a ""stronger than usual"" attack. It went offline again to avoid the attack and when it re-started, bitcoins continued to fall in value. Early on 12 April each bitcoin was worth about $90 (£58). Owners of bitcoins have also become the target of cyber thieves keen to cash in on the boom in the digital currency. A phishing gang posted a message to the discussion forum of a website used by many bitcoin traders saying MTGox was about to start trading ""litecoins"" - an alternative to bitcoins. In the message was a link that supposedly connected to an official MTGox chat site. In fact, the site that people were taken to if they clicked on the link was fake and, via a booby-trapped update file, installed malicious software that then emptied digital wallets of bitcoins. At least one trader was hit in the attack and lost 34 bitcoins as a result. In a post about the theft posted to the Bitcointalk forum, the victim said he was ""stupid"" not to have taken more trouble to stay safe but added: ""This is a serious loss for me, and unless this is handled correctly this can also badly affect the community."" It has also emerged that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claiming they had the original idea for the social network, have substantial bitcoin holdings. In an interview with the New York Times, the pair said they owned about $11m of the virtual coins - about 1% of the global supply.",-0.16840555555555559,0.0028619528619528607

Bank transaction charges and problems with phone lines have led some to reluctantly abandon accepting any other form of payment, even during the lucrative summer holidays. But one local business has decided to embrace a controversial alternative.  Nestled beside the small ads noticeboard in the crowded shop window of Swanage News is a small sticker that reads ""Bitcoin accepted here"". The so far unregulated digital currency has courted controversy because of its volatile value and its popularity among cybercriminals. With that track record, can it ever become an everyday essential? Newsagent owner Andy James hopes so. He decided to look into accepting payments in Bitcoin last month after hearing about it on a TV show. He is hoping his service will be a hit with the many tourists who flock to this part of the Jurassic Coast, in southern England, at this time of year but so far his only two Bitcoin customers have both been local.  ""The first transaction we ever did was for a Kit Kat for 65p,"" he said. ""The gentleman put it down on the counter and asked to pay by Bitcoin, It was really busy in the shop at the time and we thought he was joking, but he wasn't. It was very exciting."" Perhaps appropriately, given the currency's capricious exchange rate, Mr James's other customer spent his Bitcoin on lottery tickets. ""We were hoping they would be winners... but we don't think they were,"" he says ruefully. There are many apps and software solutions available for retailers who want to take Bitcoin.  Mr James chose an app that, like many others, converts the price from sterling into Bitcoin and then generates a QR code for the customer to scan with their smartphone.  This completes the transaction from their digital wallet into his. The Coin of Sale app was created by Tomas Forgac in Singapore.  Mr Forgac's European clients include sandwich chain Subway's outlets across the Czech Republic. He says he uses Bitcoin for most of his business expenses. ""The keyboard I'm typing this answer on and memory I added to the laptop this week have been bought with Bitcoin,"" he emailed.  ""I pay my utilities and phone bill, air-con cleaning with Bitcoin and all company expenses are in Bitcoin (server hosting, printing etc)."" But in the UK it seems Bitcoin users are more interested in spending their virtual currency on having a good time.  ""So far [our] largest transaction was a £900 bill in a bar,"" Mr Forgac said. Pub chain Individual Pubs has also found that drinkers are happy to open up their digital wallets. The company has had a good response since it started accepting Bitcoin payments in June last year, taking £750 in the first two weeks.  Director Stephen Early says he has been surprised by the level of interest, and the chain now averages around £1,000 a month in Bitcoin transactions across its five establishments in Norwich, Cambridge and Hackney, London. ""It's only a small part of the business,"" he wrote on the company website.  ""It's obviously still enthusiasts who have heard about it on the net."" Turnover may be comparatively small but even large brands such as razorblade giant King of Shaves say it feels significant. Chief executive and founder Will King says the company, which has a multimillion-pound turnover, has processed 15 orders totalling around $1,000 (£599) since it started accepting Bitcoin last month. ""I think it's huge,"" he told the BBC. ""People are as dismissive of Bitcoin now as they were of Twitter in 2007. ""People need to stop thinking of it as a bet. It's an elegant piece of friction-free currency that doesn't wear away like a £5 note does."" If there is a financial revolution taking place, Swanage News may be a bit ahead of its time locally - holidaymakers were out in force in the town but hardly any of the ones I spoke to had even heard of Bitcoin, let alone invested in it. Mr James remains optimistic.  ""It's worth doing. Obviously it's a new thing at the moment and people have to get used to it,"" he said. ""We've had loads of interest. A few people have asked how they can get hold of Bitcoins for the future, to come in next time they're down."" For now he is relying on traditional sales techniques to drum up trade. ""We're offering a discount on certain products for people if they pay by Bitcoin,"" he added. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - that acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained.",0.17867659574468087,0.10290946810703648

Elliptic Vault uses ""deep cold storage"", where private encrypted keys to bitcoins are stored on offline servers and in a secure location. The facility's founders say they are the ""first in the world"" to offer insurance for Bitcoin owners. Stolen bitcoins cannot be recovered as all transactions are irreversible. Online wallets used to store bitcoins have been subject to a number of cyber-attacks and some users have also suffered from accidental loss.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent.

These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. James Howells lost about £4.6m when he threw away his hard drive, forgetting that he had bitcoins stored on it. Unlike money stored in a conventional bank, bitcoins are not insured and there is no way of retrieving them once they are gone. ""One of the main concerns people have with Bitcoin is that it's quite difficult to store securely,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told the BBC. ""Offering people an insured storage service seemed an obvious step."" But convincing an insurance firm to trust the nascent currency was not an easy task. ""It was very difficult to find an insurer,"" said Mr Robinson, an Oxford graduate with a PhD in physics who started the company with two friends. ""The industry is very conservative and they did not understand Bitcoin.  ""They were also influenced by the negative publicity Bitcoin received, although this has improved since Silk Road [an online marketplace] was taken down and stopped dominating the Bitcoin agenda."" The company is underwritten by Lloyd's of London, which will give people ""more faith in the Bitcoin system"", according to Emily Spaven, managing editor of CoinDesk, a digital currency news site. Insurance payouts will be calculated using the Bitcoin to US dollar exchange rate at the time a claim is made. Elliptic's focus is on storing bitcoins as securely as possible, using what Mr Robinson calls ""deep cold storage"" techniques.  Bitcoin keys are encrypted and stored offline. There are multiple copies, protected by layers of cryptographic and physical security. The copies are accessible only via a quorum of Elliptic's directors. Elliptic's launch comes as Bitcoin has been making news around the world, with governments deciding how to legislate for the currency. Singapore has become one of the first countries to issue guidance on taxation for Bitcoin businesses, although it also said it was monitoring transactions to detect illicit financing by criminals and terrorists. Bitcoin was less fortunate in China, where the largest online marketplace, Alibaba Group's Taobao, said it would ban virtual currencies. In December, the country's central bank ordered financial institutions to halt Bitcoin-related services and products. There was a breakthrough for the currency in the US, however, where Overstock.com became one of the first major online retailers to accept Bitcoin on Thursday.",9.714285714285279e-05,0.04591295609152752

Yahoo confirmed that for a four-day period in January, malware was served in ads on its homepage. Experts estimate that as many as two million European users could have been hit. Security firm Light Cyber said the malware was intended to create a huge network of Bitcoin mining machines. ""The malware writers put a lot of effort into making it as efficient as possible to utilise the computing power in the best way,"" Light Cyber's founder Giora Engel told the BBC. Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to accumulate the virtual currency with little effort on their part. ""Generating bitcoins is basically guessing numbers,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology office of security firm Imperva. ""The first one to guess the right number gets 25 bitcoins and if you have a large volume of computers guessing in a co-ordinated way then you have a more efficient way of making money,"" he added. Other than a computer running slower, victims will be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ""bitnet"". It is a variation on the traditional botnet, networks of malware-infected computers used to churn out spam or bombard websites with requests in order to knock them offline. Some experts estimate that such networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day. Since bitcoins have risen in value - at its peak one bitcoin was worth $1,000 - making it a lucrative market for online criminals. ""Bitcoin mining malware is the new frontier as criminal gangs look for new ways to make money,"" said Mr Engel. Yahoo acknowledged the attack in a statement earlier this week. ""From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines - specifically, they spread malware,"" the statement read. It went on to say that users in America, Asia and Latin America weren't affected but did not specify how many European users were victims. Fox IT, the Dutch cybersecurity firm which revealed the malware attack, estimates that there were around 27,000 infections every hour the malware was live on the site. Over the period of the attack that could mean as many as two million machines were infected. Such attacks may be hard to avoid, said Mr Shulman. ""For an ad platform it is virtually impossible to guarantee 100% malware free ads."" ""There are many independent stakeholders involved in the process of web advertising, so from time to time any ad platform is bound to deliver malware.""",-0.10806999999999997,0.08805871212121212

The darknet is an encrypted version of the internet that enables anonymity. Two men in their 30s were arrested. Police found ecstasy tablets, LSD and other controlled drugs, as well as internet currency and records that may lead to further arrests, near South Circular Road, Dublin, on Wednesday. Bitcoins, a digital currency used to pay for anonymous transactions over the internet, worth ""between 1.5m and 2m euros"", were found on computers seized during the raid.  The police also recovered 180,000 euros (£140,000) of drugs. A police spokesperson said: ""A critical part of this operation was preservation of data on encrypted computers which is related to the worldwide distribution of controlled drugs. ""The fact that such a significant vendor has been arrested in the presence of an encrypted but open computer with address lists for customers all over the world will be of significant interest to many global law enforcement agencies who specialise in darknet investigations."" The raid came after weeks of surveillance.  At a follow up search in Harolds Cross, Dublin, police also made a small seizure of controlled drugs and found documentation in relation to off-shore bank accounts in Switzerland, Belize, Poland and a number of other countries. Police have also seized a number of bitcoins, an internet currency that enables anonymous transactions, that were stored on computers recovered.  The technology used to create the darknet is also used by people in countries like Iran and China, to circumvent government restrictions on internet access. It is also used to create online marketplaces for illegal products and services.

BTC China has said that local payment companies have been blocked from providing it with clearing services. It means that the firm - the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange in terms of trading volumes - can no longer accept yuan-based deposits. Prices tumbled following the news. One bitcoin was trading for as low as 2,560 yuan ($421, £258), according to the South China Morning Post. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.

That compares with an all-time high of 7,588 yuan ($1,250; £764) in late November. Exchanges in other countries also reported drops, with Japan-based MtGox seeing the exchange rate for one bitcoin fall from $717 to as low as $480 in Wednesday's trade. ""A lot of people put Bitcoin's rise over recent months to China where interest in it has gone through the roof,"" said Emily Spaven, editor of digital currency news site CoinDesk told the BBC. ""People are getting frightened that with the new regulations the country could now drop out of the ecosystem. Going forward, it's certainly not the end of Bitcoin, but people have been panic selling."" Virtual currency exchanges in China are not licensed by the country's central bank to accept or pay out yuan to their customers, making them reliant on independent clearing houses to act as middlemen. ""We essentially got notice from our third-party provider today that they will discontinue accepting payments for us and new deposits,"" Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, told SCMP. ""We're still operating a Bitcoin exchange in China legally, and we're still allowing people to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin, and withdraw renminbi [yuan].""  According to Yicai - a business news website with ties to the government - the news followed a meeting between officials from the People's Bank of China and 10 clearing houses on Monday in Beijing, at which the firms were told they had until the end of January to sever links to the country's Bitcoin exchanges. This followed an earlier notice, issued by the regulators a fortnight ago, which banned local banks from handling transactions involving bitcoins. The virtual currency is not backed by a central bank of its own, and is best thought of as being virtual tokens, rather than real-world coins, which derive their value from the ability to exchange them for cash or use them to buy goods.  One expert suggested the crackdown was the result of the Chinese government's fears that locals were using it as a way to bypass currency controls in order to move their savings out of the country. ""China is trying to grow its domestic economy and rebalance it from an export and investment-based model to a consumer driven one over the next decade, and to do that the authorities want to keep as much yuan within the country as possible,"" said Jinny Yan, an economist with Standard Chartered bank. ""They don't want to curtail any innovation in the financial sector. However, at the moment any unexpected growth and development in channels that allow by-passing of capital controls will cause anxiety."" Ms Spaven added that she believed Bitcoin would eventually bounce back. ""Underneath all the speculative trading is a robust technology that has intrinsic value as a payment network, offering cheaper and faster money transfer than any other options that exist currently,"" she said. ""If you look at our Bitcoin Price Index, you can see that prices dipped to below the current level this time last month and soon bounced back. I believe the same will happen this time around. It may take some time, but the price will rise again.""",0.07831428571428571,0.06683817769532055
212,From Brexit with love: Lithuania sees its chance,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46670752,2019-02-06 01:24:32+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"They are the hot new trend in finance, and Marius Jurgilas's mission is to lure them to Lithuania. Yet even he has been shocked by the ""overwhelming"" number of enquiries from UK ""fintech"" companies in recent months. The reason is Brexit.  Financial technology companies are making last-minute plans in case of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. Many are looking to secure financial licences in other EU states to protect their operations, and this Baltic nation has an eye on helping to fill the gap.  Mr Jurgilas, a Bank of Lithuania board member, has had some notable successes.  Customers of new-age bank Revolut might not know it has acquired its banking licence in Lithuania. Google's parent company Alphabet has one too.  Mr Jurgilas insists his country's new direction is not all about Brexit.  ""It was a coincidence,"" he says. ""Mostly we just want innovation to happen here, not 10 years down the road after things are implemented in Sweden.""  Marius Jurgilas is not alone. On the seventh floor of a shiny new office block, the Blockchain Centre is on the hunt for hot new fintech markets in Lithuania's name.  Inside, it is silent and the mood intense. Workers in headphones stare at black screens awash with code.  Motivational posters on the walls carry messages such as: ""The future will be decentralised.""  This one-year-old centre - which offers co-working space and consultancy services to start-ups using blockchain technology - plays to its EU credentials. Its website has an EU rather than a Lithuanian domain. But chief executive Egle Nemeikstyte says the centre is casting its net far beyond Europe. Australia, Singapore and Israel all want EU partners. There is still plenty of scepticism about how blockchain should be used, and Ms Nemeikstyte sometimes has to dissuade people from jumping on the bandwagon.  ""Lots of people come to us with ideas and we say that's great, but you don't need blockchain for it. Go ahead without it,"" she advises.  Lithuania's expansion has been compared to Iceland, where the three biggest banks grew too fast and collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008. Marius Jurgilas insists such comparisons are unfair and Lithuania is far from gung-ho in the field.  ""We don't have the framework yet to know how to manage the risks. We don't want to go too fast in that area,"" he says of blockchain and crypto-currencies. And yet the Bank of Lithuania offers ""no regulatory sanctions for the first year of operations"", which some have suggested could be a sign of laxity. Officials will also be keen to avoid the money-laundering cases that befell its neighbours, Latvia and Estonia. What Lithuania does offer is a regulatory ""sandbox"", which allows financial technology companies to test products in a limited environment and under supervision. Such sandboxes are not common, but they are cropping up in places as disparate as Arizona and Kuwait. Critics worry that they mark a race to the bottom, but supporters insist they boost innovation and can be well-managed.  One of Lithuania's biggest coups, or perhaps risks, has been in backing financial technology company Revolut.  Valued at $1.7bn (£1.3bn), it is one of the world's fast-growing app-based banks.  Brexit is a primary reason for its move to Vilnius, but it will still retain its London HQ and the electric money licence it has from UK regulators. Last year it advertised for its third head of compliance in less than 18 months, and some have argued that it may be expanding too fast.  However, the company insists it is just looking for the right fit.  And there was ""no cutting corners"" when the company secured its specialised banking licence from Lithuania, insists head of business development Andrius Biceika. That will allow Revolut to offer full current accounts, pay interest on deposits and issue loans. By choosing Lithuania, it can operate across the EU. ""We are going to pilot all this in Lithuania and then passport to other countries,"" says Mr Biceika. ""We are seeing lots of companies using Lithuania as a springboard.""  In the UK, all the talk about Lithuania has travelled the corridors of Level 39 - a three-floor tech hub in London's Canary Wharf, where a number of its residents have been making insurance plans for Brexit. TransferGo - a money transferring company for migrant workers - received its electronic money licence from the Lithuanian central bank in July 2018. BABB - a yet-to-launch money transfer company that has no connections to Lithuania - is also midway through the process.  While both made the decision because of Brexit uncertainty, both also cited Lithuania's local talent and helpful regulators as other motivations.  Go to an event for fintech start-ups in Vilnius and the room teems with enthusiastic young entrepreneurs.  In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, various international companies came here to save money. Among them was Western Union, where many Lithuanians learnt the ropes of finance. ""We used to compete over low costs,"" says Vilnius Mayor Remigijus Simasius. ""But now it is more about talent."" Vilnius has certainly been putting itself out there. In mid-2018, it launched a bizarre tourist campaign called ""G-spot of Europe"" complete with tagline: ""Nobody knows where it is but when you find it, it's amazing."" Co-working hub Rise Vilnius is where you will find dozens of the new companies. Backed by British bank Barclays, it is one of seven such hubs in Mumbai, Tel Aviv, London, Manchester, Cape Town and New York. ""There was scepticism that we would find enough fintech start-ups here, but we proved them wrong,"" says Mariano Andrade Gonzalez, executive director of Barclays' operations centre in Lithuania. The mayor of Vilnius says companies have discovered that the city's workforce is particularly suited to the new start-ups, because Lithuanians have good mathematical skills. ""Maybe that goes down to the dark times of the Soviet Union. People studied these things instead of social studies. ""It was natural for us to move into fintech, even before Brexit. We are willing to adapt to the future, not fight it.""",0.05104107142857144,0.08852507859204287

It added that it was planning to step up its efforts to curb the use of bitcoins to launder cash.  Individuals were still free to trade in bitcoins but should be aware of the risks involved, said the People's Bank of China (PBOC), adding that it planned to formalise the regulation of exchanges that dealt in the digital cash. Experts told Reuters the PBOC was moved to make its decision because Chinese nationals were heavily involved in trading the virtual currency.  Many believe this is because it helps them avoid controls on trade in the yuan.  The value of bitcoins traded on Chinese exchanges fell after the announcement was made. Interest in the virtual currency has seen its value soar in recent weeks. On 28 November, the value of one bitcoin surpassed $1,000 for the first time. The swift rise in value led Mr Greenspan to say the exchange rate for the virtual currency was ""unsustainably high"" in an interview with Bloomberg. ""It's a bubble"", he said, going on to question the financial value people had pinned on bitcoins.

214,Bitcoin: Experts clash over the crypto-currency,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25130261,2013-11-28 00:01:51+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"You can use it to buy beer in Berlin, order pizza in Amsterdam, hire a taxi in Edinburgh, schedule a dental check-up in Ljubljana, do a degree in Nicosia, purchase Alpaca socks from Massachusetts - or even blast off into space with Virgin Galactic. Every day, it seems, another service joins the Bitcoin revolution, accepting payment in the so-called virtual currency. As its popularity has soared, so has its price. On Wednesday it breached the $1,000 (£614) mark on Japan's MtGox exchange for the first time. That's nearly five times the price it was at earlier in the month. Several reasons have been given for the surge:  If all of that makes it sounds like more of an asset than a real currency, then that's probably because it's a fair description.  Unlike ""real-world"" currencies, there is no central bank backing Bitcoin and anyone with a powerful enough computer can create one as part of a technique called ""mining"", which is used to process transactions. Understanding exactly how the Bitcoin system works is only marginally easier than tracking down its mysterious creator - Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the author or authors of the 2008 research paper that sparked its existence.  And, in truth, interest in Bitcoin arguably outweighs its role in the wider economy, with the possible exception of the way it has facilitated illegal trades on underground sites such as the Silk Road.  But what makes it important is what it tells us about the role virtual currencies might play in the years to come.  On this point, however, there is a divide between those who think it is a fantasy destined for failure, and those who think it will underpin the future of finance. The BBC invited a Bitcoin advocate and a sceptic to explain their views: Why does Bitcoin have value?  Over the past few years, I must have been asked this hundreds of times.  I first used Bitcoin in April 2009, just a few months after it was first released to the world. Back then, it had no value at all - there were no users and no trade, no exchanges and thus no exchange rate. Now Bitcoin is reaching new heights thanks to a combination of speculation on future value and genuine, undeniable usefulness. Think about it: Why can it take days or weeks for banks to send money around the world, when an email travels in seconds? Does the money travel by steamboat? Are they loading gold bars onto the side of a camel and sending it over the mountains of Mongolia? Of course not. Plan 99 homepage The real answer is depressing - banking is a stagnant market running on long-obsolete infrastructure, which improves only when forced to by government. Same day payments happened only after banks were dragged into the 19th century by the Office of Fair Trading. When Metro Bank opened in 2010, it received the first new UK banking licence issued in 150 years. Bitcoin has created a firestorm of excitement throughout the world because it's a new financial system, designed from scratch by the people, for the people. It's not only fast, cheap and easy. In Bitcoin, every participant has equal power. There are no bankers, because there are no banks. There are no banks because there is no need for them: People can control their own money. The rules of the system are enforced on everyone by each other. Not even the current software developers can tamper with it against the wishes of the users. With better technology comes new features. The web is powered by advertising because credit cards are too inefficient to pay for most content. Bitcoin enables micropayments - instead of ads, tiny fractions of a penny could flow from your browser directly to sites you visit, with no middleman fees making the scheme impractical. Crowdfunding doesn't need to be restricted to sites like Kickstarter, which have complex policies and fees - people can do it themselves. Even something as trivial as a child running a lemonade stand can now be made digital, because anyone with a smartphone can accept Bitcoin: No complicated merchant bank accounts are needed. Bitcoin is barely five years old. It has its problems - volatility, geekiness and an appeal to criminals come to mind. With your help the project can overcome these issues and change the world. Trade on! Bitcoin is a beautiful example of what the psychoanalyst David Tuckett calls a ""fantastic object"" - unreal but immensely attractive. The Bitcoin experience accesses notions of stateless money, peer-to-peer exchange, and of course, no regulation or financial intermediation. The origin story is clever and cute, and just hard enough to understand to induce a belief in the stability of the supply of the bitcoins, leading to a rush for them now, as opposed to later. Bitcoin's value is dependent entirely on what you, the buyer, are willing to pay for it. If there were no users, there wouldn't be any value. Because it has no use value, only exchange value, Bitcoin can have literally any price, and so the market for Bitcoin is permanently in a bubble as a result. This bubble will form and burst many times, making and losing fortunes in the process. I'm Irish. I know exactly what crazy bubbles look like. classes/papers/books/rants blog The Bitcoin phenomenon is the purest manifestation of what Charles McKay described in his 1841 book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. At the psychological level of the investor, there's no difference between bitcoins, tulips, railways, or the stock market bubbles of the 1920s, 1990s, or the mid 2000s. In this case a lot of people are deciding a string of electrons are worth something, as opposed to nothing, and they want to sell it to the next guy as soon as possible. As long as you pass your Bitcoins on to the next guy while extracting a profit, you'll be happy. There is always a greater fool. Right up until the moment there isn't one. Economically, Bitcoin is nothing special.  It's a speculative asset people are buying primarily to flip onto someone else. The ""money 2.0"" stuff is just marketing, and has been tried before, in the US in the 1850s during the free banking period, for example. As I've said elsewhere, this time really isn't different, but you can tweet about it. The fact Bitcoin isn't regulated is a big plus for some. As one Bitcoin promoter boasted to me recently- and he did this himself - you can move $1m worth of Bitcoin across a border on a Zip Drive and not be detected. The authorities won't allow this to last for long. Bitcoin's biggest boosters are also holding large amounts of the stuff, so beware, buyers. My colleague Karl Whelan has suggested Bitcoin may simply be competed out of existence by other services like LiteCoin, TerraCoin, and AllahCoin, or regulated by national and international governments if it becomes associated with largely criminal activity. Readers holding Bitcoin will be shaking their heads reading my piece - the value has exploded by thousands of percent in a single year! To which I respond: Exactly. Get into Bitcoin or another digital currency if you want. I hope it makes you rich. But don't kid yourself this is anything more than speculation for a quick buck.  The messianic stuff will go out the window once it collapses. There are lots of things in the real economy to invest in too. The big advantage of Bitcoin as ""stateless money"" is that when it collapses, the government won't have to bail it out. ",0.08098939393939394,0.12042817241680877
215,Cryptocurrencies continue to tumble on Goldman reports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45434623,2018-09-06 11:59:17+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin and other digital currencies have continued to tumble in value, amid concerns that Wall Street institutions are shunning cryptocurrencies. It follows media reports, originally in Business Insider, that Goldman Sachs is shelving plans to set up a cryptocurrency trading desk. Mainstream lenders have largely kept their distance from digital currencies. A Goldman spokesman said the bank had yet to decide on the scope of its ""digital asset offering"". On Thursday, Bitcoin was trading down 4.45%, or $300 on the day, at $6,382.  The cryptocurrency has lost two-thirds of its value in the past nine months. It was trading above $19,000 in mid-December, and if its falls continue it could threaten this year's low of $5,887. Meanwhile other coins were also losing value on Thursday - with Ethereum down 12%, Litecoin losing 11%, and XRP behind by 7%. The future regulatory framework for digital coins remains unclear, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned some coins issued in initial coin offerings might be regarded as securities. That means that dealing in them would be subject to federal law. Other issues of concern around cryptocurrencies include potential money-laundering and market manipulation. The overall market capitalisation of virtual currencies has lost three-quarters of its value since its January peak, according to Coinmarketcap, slumping from $800bn to around $200bn now. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at FX firm Oanda, said: ""It's been a rough 24 hours for Bitcoin and its peers, with reports that Goldman Sachs has postponed launching a cryptocurrency trading desk due to the uncertain regulatory landscape."" He added: ""The regulatory environment is going to be key to all of this and the fact that Goldman Sachs remains so concerned is clearly a blow.""",-0.03606153846153845,-0.040917785917785915
216,'Legitimate' Bitcoin's value soars after Senate hearing,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24986264,2013-11-19 16:32:08+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The value of virtual currency Bitcoin has soared to over $900 (£559), after a US Senate committee hearing. The committee was told that virtual currencies were a ""legitimate financial service"" with the same benefits and risks as other online payment systems. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is exploring the ""promises and risks"" of Bitcoin for ""government and society at large"".  The currency has more than trebled in value since October. The US Senate hearing was prompted by the closure of the Silk Road website in October. The site, which sold drugs and other illegal goods, was shut down by the FBI. Users of the site were required to pay for their transactions using bitcoins. Representatives from the Department of Justice and financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission have been asked to provide their views about virtual currencies to the committee and submissions have been received from the FBI and the US Federal Reserve. ""Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of the rest of us,"" the chair of the committee, Senator Thomas Carper, said in opening remarks. The FBI, in a letter to the committee released on Sunday, said that it recognised virtual currencies offered ""legitimate financial services"" but they could be ""exploited by malicious actors"". Mythili Raman, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, told the committee: ""We have seen increasing use of such currencies by drug dealers, traffickers of child pornography, and perpetrators of large-scale fraud schemes."" Jerry Brito, senior research fellow at George Mason University told Bloomberg: ''Two years ago it was alarm when Silk Road first came on the scene.  ''Since then, Congress has been educating itself and understands that there are great potential benefits, and like any new technology there are going to be some challenges. But they see there is a balance to be struck here and they are generally positive on the technology,"" he said. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. Trade in Bitcoin is small compared with that in countries' official currencies. But since its creation in 2008, Bitcoin has become a popular way to pay for things online. There are currently more than 12 million bitcoins in existence according to Bitcoincharts, a website that provides financial information about the currency. On one exchange site, Mt. Gox, the value of the currency rose to $900 (£559) on Monday before falling back to $727 (£452). This compares with a price of $200 (£124) in late October. The closing down of Silk Road and hearings in front of US government committees have led some to believe that prices are increasing as investors think Bitcoin will gain more mainstream acceptance. ""Lots of factors are driving the price action in Bitcoin, including pure speculation,"" said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics. ""Regulatory interest in Bitcoin also traditionally has a positive effect on the price of Bitcoin,"" he added. Jan Lambregts, head of financial market research at Rabobank, which does not trade in Bitcoin, said regulators were right to get involved. ""Looking at it from a distance, it very much looks like it could be a speculative bubble. It's a small market, with a lot of interest in it, which is inflating and distorting the price,"" he said. ""But you can see the concerns for governments - this is a currency outside their normal domain and which is not influenced by central banks. ""It may all be relatively small-scale now, but decisions taken now could have wider repercussions were such virtual currency experiments to be expanded in the future,"" he added. Some have questioned whether trading in Bitcoin is insufficiently transparent and therefore easier to use for  illegitimate means. Patrick Murck, from the Bitcoin Foundation, which promotes the use of the currency, told the BBC that the network was very open and everybody could see every transaction that happened. ""I would challenge that it's for illegitimate use or bad actions. What we're finding is not that it's a haven for illegitimate activities but that there are many legitimate uses,"" he said. Whatever people are using Bitcoin for, Mr Brito thinks it's here to stay. ""These hearings mean Bitcoin is finally coming into its own,"" he said. ""It's a real thing and it's not going anywhere and these hearings highlight that.""",0.11904042553191489,0.08912480939076683

It had been alleged about 14,000 of its customers' PCs had been used to generate the virtual currency in April. E-Sports Entertainment has agreed to pay the State of New Jersey $1m (£620,000) to resolve the case. However, it can avoid handing over $675,000 of that if it does not break the law for 10 years.

New Jersey's acting attorney general said the settlement served as a message that the authorities would protect citizens against anyone who invaded their computer privacy. ""These defendants illegally hijacked thousands of people's personal computers without their knowledge or consent, and in doing so gained the ability to monitor their activities, mine for virtual currency that had real dollar value, and otherwise invade and damage their computers,"" said John Hoffman in a statement. E-Sports said that it had fired the employee responsible for the incident and would submit to regular privacy audits by a third party. But it stressed that it had not admitted to breaking the law. ""The settlement that was signed makes explicitly clear that we do not agree, nor do we admit, to any of the State of New Jersey's allegations,"" it said on its blog. ""The press release issued by the attorney general about our settlement represents a deep misunderstanding of the facts of the case, the nature of our business, and the technology in question."" E-Sports charges gamers a subscription to allow them to play supported games - such as Counter-Strike and League of Legends - against each other safe in the knowledge that it has installed anti-cheat software on their PCs. New Jersey had alleged the company had generated about $3,500 over a fortnight in April by adding code to its product that created a ""botnet"" - a network of computers controlled through malware - to generate Bitcoins. Bitcoins can be created by using a PC's processors to solve complicated mathematical problems in a technique called ""mining"". This allows Bitcoin transactions to be processed, and acts as an incentive for third parties to provide the necessary computing power. The matter came to light in May when a user noticed unusually high usage of his PC's graphics processing unit (GPU) at times when he was not using the computer. E-Sports' co-founder Eric Thunberg initially dismissed the affair as an April Fools joke gone wrong. However, following a user backlash - he later acknowledged ""this is way more shady than I originally thought"" and blamed the ""unauthorised"" use of the Bitcoin mining code on a rogue employee who had acted for ""personal gain"". Affected members were subsequently offered a free month's subscription and the company promised to help anyone whose processors might have overheated and been damaged as a result of its software.",0.15856,0.07005808080808082

Its entire stock of Bitcoins stored on-line, in its so-called ""hot wallet"", were stolen.  Coins held in ""cold storage"" or in servers not connected to the internet were not taken. Last week, the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, filed for bankruptcy protection after it suffered a $500m theft.  Bitcoin is a digital or crypto-currency which is bought and sold online, but not backed by any country's central bank or government. Flexcoin called itself the first Bitcoin bank. It provided centralised storage and enabled instant free transfers between Flexcoin customers. It said in a statement: ""On 2 March 2014, Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet. The attacker made off with 896 [Bitcoins]. ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately. ""Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity. Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge."" Flexcoin and Mt Gox are not the only casualties in Bitcoin's battle with security. On Tuesday, Poloniex, another exchange, also admitted that 12.3% of its reserves had been stolen by hackers.  The Slovenia-based Bitstamp had to halt business temporarily after a cyber-attack in February.  The payment processor Inputs.io was hacked in October to the tune of $1m. The Bitcoin market has shrugged off the latest thefts. Since the beginning of March, the value of a Bitcoin has risen from $561 to $668. There are plans by several governments to regulate Bitcoins. A Japanese government spokesman said talks on Bitcoin guidelines were in progress.  The Nikkei Business Daily reported on Wednesday that the government would tax Bitcoin transactions and ban banks and securities firms from handling the digital currency. US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the US Congress should look into legal options for regulating virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.

In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved. The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website.

It said an investigation had revealed it was possible for thieves to fool the transaction process so that double the correct amount of bitcoins would be sent. Bitcoins fell from $700 (£427) to $540. The Tokyo-based firm said it was now working with the Bitcoin core development team to ""mitigate this issue"", which it said was not limited to its own Bitcoin-wallet system. A Bitcoin wallet is the place where Bitcoin addresses - the virtual post-boxes where each bitcoin is stored - are kept. It added that cash withdrawals and transfers of bitcoins to - rather than from - Bitcoin Wallets were unaffected. MtGox said in a statement: ""A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur.

Garrick Hileman, from the London School of Economics, who researches alternative currencies, said it was too early to tell how serious this was for Bitcoin users. ""It's a reason to be concerned, but it's a little early to say that there's something fundamentally flawed with Bitcoin software. Previous problems have been corrected,"" he said. ""It reflects the immaturity of the software. Bitcoin is still a technology in the process of being developed,"" he added. In an apparent clampdown on the use of Bitcoin in Russia, the Russian prosecutor general's office said it was tightening up regulations surrounding the use of virtual currencies as they could be used for money laundering or financing terrorism. It said that the rouble was the only official currency in Russia and introducing others was illegal. ""Systems for anonymous payments and cyber-currencies that have gained considerable circulation - including the most well-known, Bitcoin - are money substitutes and cannot be used by individuals or legal entities,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.

Tracking website Blockchain logged 982 megawatt hours of electricity consumption over a 24-hour period by Bitcoin miners around the world. According to Bloomberg, that is enough to power 31,000 homes in the US. Watchdog Ofgem claims the average UK household uses 3.3MwH per year. Blockchain said the rough cost of that amount of power was $147,000 (£95,000).  However, it also suggested profits of $681,000 (£444,000) may have been made as a result of the mining. Bitcoins are earned online by completing difficult computing tasks. Mining involves solving a hard mathematical problem and miners typically use large numbers of computers to speed up the number-crunching involved.  The more mining takes place, the harder it becomes to mine new Bitcoins and the more power is required for the process. Writer Mark Gimein described the energy requirements as ""an environmental disaster"" in a blog post for Bloomberg. ""Real-world mining of precious metals for currency was a resource-hungry and value-destroying process. Bitcoin mining is too,"" he wrote. However, other analysts disagree. Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, dismissed the quantity of electricity being used for mining as ""trivial"" on the website Forbes. ""There are around 120 million or so households in the US. Therefore Bitcoin mining is consuming 0.025% of the US household electricity supply,"" he wrote.

Instead, said MTGox, the ""rather astonishing"" number of new accounts that had been opened in the past few days caused a bump in trading volumes that it was unprepared for. In one day, the number of trades in Bitcoins had tripled, it said.  This caused ""lag"" or delay, which meant that Bitcoins were not swapped between people as fast as needed.  ""As expected in such situation people started to panic, started to sell Bitcoin in mass (panic sale) resulting in an increase of trade that ultimately froze the trade engine,"" it said. About 80% of all the trade in Bitcoins goes through MTGox. Engineers were working to improve the MTGox trading engine to handle the huge number of transactions, it said. The exchange added that it was planning to shut down for a couple of hours to add servers to help cope with the load. Tech news site Ars Technica linked the crash to the antics of an anonymous Bitcoin owner who gave away around $13,000 in Bitcoins via the Reddit social news site. The unnamed person, who used the alias Bitcoinbillionaire on Reddit, randomly picked 13 different people to receive the coins. One lucky Redditor got a gift of about $5,000 (£3,250). The vast increase in interest in Bitcoins is also creating problems for some established members of the digital cash community.  Bitcoins are created, or mined, when computers complete a complicated mathematical problem. Many individuals have pooled their computer power to ensure this mathematical work is completed more quickly. But the rising value has meant the MT Red mining pool, which is co-ordinated via Reddit, cannot keep up with its financial obligations to its pool members and is shutting down. The ""soaring price"" has made it impossible for MT Red to cover what it owes to members, an administrator said.",0.06135217391304348,0.006594934855804424
228,Hack attacks hit Bitcoin exchange rates,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22026961,2013-04-04 11:28:18+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Online services and exchanges dealing in Bitcoins have been hit by hack attacks that led to a drop in the value of the virtual currency. Trading on the MTGox exchange, which handles most trades in Bitcoins, was sluggish yesterday as the site fought off an attack. The attack helped to force a swift fall in the price of Bitcoins. In addition, the Instawallet website - where people store Bitcoins - is offline indefinitely after an attack. The value of Bitcoins surged to a new high this week with each one worth about $142 (£94). Barely a week ago, each virtual coin was worth only $90.  But Bitcoins dropped sharply in value as the MTGox exchange came under a sustained attack by hackers. The vast majority of trade in Bitcoins takes place via the site.  In a tweet on its Twitter feed, MTGox said it was fighting off a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which involves a site being bombarded with huge amounts of data. The attack was one of several against the site this week, The attacks, coupled with a spike in trading volumes, combined to cause delays in trades being confirmed and led the value of Bitcoins to drop sharply to about $120. The attacks could be the work of malicious hackers who were trying to ""game"" the exchange and manipulate the value of Bitcoins so they could cash in, MTGox said in an interview with ComputerWorld. Attackers are thought to be working to a cycle in which they sell Bitcoins when values are high, then mount an attack that forces prices to crash, buy up the cheaper coins and then let the value climb again. MTGox said it did not know when or if the attacks would cease but said Bitcoin owners should not panic and sell off as values fluctuated. A spokesman for the exchange added that it was in the middle of rebuilding its trading technology but the new system, which would do a better job of handling the high volume of trades, would not be ready until the end of this year. In a separate development, Instawallet has shut down ""indefinitely"" after hackers ""fraudulently accessed"" its core database. In a statement posted on the Instawallet site it said it planned to open a claim process shortly so people could reclaim their Bitcoin balance.",-0.15374999999999994,0.06161489898989899

Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen, 68, disappeared from her home near Oslo on 31 October. The investigation has been continuing since then, police said, but was given ""a low profile"" because ""very serious threats have been made"". The kidnappers have demanded €9m ($10m; £8m), Norwegian media report. Broadcaster NRK said the ransom had been demanded in an equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency Monero - a digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Mrs Hagen is married to Tom Hagen, a businessman with an estimated fortune of 1.7bn Norwegian krone (€174m; £156m) made in the real estate and energy industries. Norway's financial magazine Kapital named him 172nd on its list of the country's wealthiest people. NRK says the couple live a ""secluded lifestyle"" in Lorenskog, east of Oslo, describing Tom Hagen as ""media-shy and private"". There has been no evidence since she disappeared that Mrs Hagen is safe, police say. ""As the case now stands, police have advised the family not to settle the claim,"" Tommy Broske, head of the investigation unit, said. News of the months-long disappearance was first reported by the newspaper Aftenposten early on Wednesday, which said it had known about the case for some time but had chosen not to publish details to protect Mrs Hagen. It said Mrs Hagen appeared to have been abducted from the bathroom of her home and that there had been ""limited dialogue"" with the alleged kidnappers over the internet. On Wednesday morning, as Aftenposten published its report, police put a cordon around the couple's home. In a statement, police said they had made the decision to make the case public despite threats from the kidnappers, in order to appeal for more information. The police statement said the main hypothesis ""has always been that the woman was abducted against her will"" and that ""extensive"" forensic work has been carried out at the home. ""Our goal is to find the woman alive and reunite her with the family,"" said Mr Broske.  ""As in all serious criminal cases, time is an important factor, and we rely on tips... to help us find the missing woman.""

Bitcoin, a virtual currency, has been attracting a lot of interest and its value surpassed $1,000 recently. Backers of the currency, which is not controlled by regulators, have been pushing for its increased usage.   Coinbase said it will use the funding to ""educate the market, and promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin"".  ""We are nearing a tipping point for broad adoption of Bitcoin - what we at Coinbase believe to be one of the most important shifts in the global economy in our lifetime,"" the firm said in a blogpost. Confidence in Bitcoins has grown after a US Senate committee described it as a ""legitimate financial service"" at a meeting in October. However, on Friday, the European Banking Authority (EBA) warned about the potential risks of using Bitcoins.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. ""In particular, consumers should be aware that exchange platforms tend to be unregulated and are not banks that hold their virtual currency as a deposit,"" the EBA said.  ""Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the European Union that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business."" China, the world's second largest economy, has also banned its banks from handling Bitcoin transactions, saying they had no legal status and should not be used as a currency. At the same time, there have been concerns that the rise in Bitcoin's value has been triggered by speculators looking to cash in on its popularity.  Alan Greenspan, former US Federal Reserve chairman, has called the rapid rise a ""bubble"". Despite these concerns, some establishments across the globe have started to accept Bitcoins as a form of payment, just like cash or credit cards.  Coinbase said the number of people who use its Bitcoin wallet had doubled to more than 600,000 in the past two months and almost 10,000 new people were signing up every day.   It said it was also working with 16,000 merchants to provide Bitcoin payments.  ""We are making it easier for consumers to buy, merchants to sell, and developers to build,"" the firm said.  Chris Dixon, of venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz - which led the Coinbase funding, said in a blogpost that the Bitcoin platform could be used to develop new technologies. He said the potential applications of Bitcoins include ""machine-to-machine payments to reduce spam"" and offering ""low-cost financial services to people who, because of financial or political constraints, don't have them today"".",0.14332333333333336,0.06856818181818182

A judge in Dallas, Texas, agreed to protect the firm's assets and temporarily halt two US lawsuits while bankruptcy proceedings occur in Japan. The firm filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February after losing about $473m (£284m) worth of customers' bitcoins to what it says was a hacking attack. Mt Gox is scheduled to return to court on 1 April to extend the protections. The firm filed for Chapter 15 protection in the US late on Sunday. The filing asks the US bankruptcy court to recognize Mt Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and protect its US assets. And it gives Mt Gox a temporary reprieve against two US lawsuits: one a class-action suit in Chicago filed by an Illinois resident, and another a $75m breach-of-contract case filed in Seattle by Coinlab Inc. At the time of the Mt Gox theft, about 750,000 customer bitcoins were stolen as well as close to 100,000 of Mt Gox's own bitcoins. That amounts to about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. Steven Woodrow, the lawyer leading the Chicago class-action suit, told Judge Harlin Hale that the case was a ""massive fraud"".

The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will initially sell $20m (£13m) worth of shares to investors, according to a filing with the US regulators. The twins are among the key backers of Bitcoin, a virtual currency traded independently of monetary authorities. Its value jumped earlier this year, but has been highly volatile. In January its value surged from $15 for each Bitcoin, to a high of $260 on 10 April, before crashing.  Bitcoins are now trading at a price of about $90 each. Like other currencies, Bitcoins are used to buy goods and services, with companies selling anything from software to online dating accepting it as payment.  The currency is created by the application of a mathematical formula in a process known as ""Bitcoin mining"". A key feature of Bitcoins is that their supply can never exceed a certain number - 21 million - which has led some to speculate that their value may rise further.  In their filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the twins said that shares in the trust were ""designed for investors seeking a cost-effective and convenient means to gain exposure to Bitcoins with minimal credit risk"".  The trust fund is to be listed on an as-yet-undetermined exchange - such as Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The value of the fund is expected to track closely the value of the underlying Bitcoins in which it will be invested. But - unlike with Bitcoins - the intention is that investors will be able to sell shares in the trust fund short, in effect allowing them to speculate that the value of Bitcoins will fall. Earlier this year, the Winklevoss twins had told the New York Times that they owned about $11m of the virtual coins - about 1% of the global supply. They have set up Math-Based Asset Services LLC which will be the sponsor of the trust. The SEC filing warned that as ""the sponsor and its management have no history of operating an investment vehicle like the Trust, their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the Trust"".

The theoretical attack tries to subvert the way that computers involved in Bitcoin share information.  It plays upon the fact that everyone involved in keeping track of Bitcoin assumes all participants are honest.  Such an attack could already be happening, said the US researchers who discovered the vulnerability.  ""Bitcoin is broken, "" wrote Prof Emin Surer, one of the Cornell University scientists who developed the attack, in a blogpost describing the work. The weakness he and Dr Ittay Eyal uncovered is fundamental to the way that Bitcoin works, he said, and emerges from the way that people find or mint new coins.  Typically new Bitcoins are generated by getting lots of computers to tackle a complicated cryptographic puzzle. At any given moment thousands of computers are involved in tackling this puzzle.  Roughly every ten minutes one group involved in solving this puzzle is rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as ""mining"" because, like miners, those who take part have to sift a lot of dross before they find a valuable nugget. As soon as the new coins are found, the news is circulated and everyone starts working on the next puzzle. One Bitcoin is currently worth about £145. The Cornell attack involves one large mining group that does not say when it has been rewarded with new Bitcoins. This ""selfish"" mining group then begins working on the cryptographic puzzle that will eventually release the next reward.  This gives it an advantage because every other mining group will still be working on a puzzle that has already been solved. By leveraging this advantage and being careful about when they release information about new Bitcoins they have mined, the group could gradually take control of the entire mining system.  ""Once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency,"" wrote Prof Surer. The pair pointed out that there were already mining groups big enough to mount a selfish attack on the protocol. The two researchers have also proposed updating the protocol to limit the size of mining groups and make the whole system less susceptible to a selfish attack. Vitalik Buterin, technical editor of Bitcoin Magazine, said the attack was ""highly theoretical"" because no software currently existed that could turn an honest mining group into a selfish one. At the moment Bitcoin software shares information about what different miners are doing with the entire community. For a group to become selfish they would have to change this fundamental Bitcoin software in order to manipulate this information flow. In addition, he said, only the biggest pools could try to subvert the system and the communication demands of the network would likely stymie those attempts. In addition, he said, the rewards of selfish behaviour were outweighed by the benefits of being honest. ""No honest (or semi-honest) miner would want to join a selfish pool,"" he suggested. ""Even if they do have a small incentive to [join], they have an even greater incentive to not break the Bitcoin network to preserve the value of their own Bitcoins and mining hardware.""",0.05802692307692307,-0.006882839382839388

The Department of Justice said Robert Faiella, known as BTCKing, and Charlie Shrem from BitInstant.com have both been charged with money laundering. The authorities said the pair were engaged in a scheme to sell more than $1m (£603,000) in bitcoins to users of online drug marketplace the Silk Road. The site was shut down last year and its alleged owner was arrested. Mr Shrem, 24, was arrested on Sunday at New York's JFK airport. He was expected to appear in court on Monday, prosecutors said. Mr Faiella, 52, was arrested on Monday at his home in Cape Coral, Florida. Bitcoin exchanges are services that allow users to trade bitcoins for traditional currencies. Mr Shrem is accused of allowing Mr Faiella to use BitInstant to purchase large quantities of bitcoins to sell on to Silk Road users who wanted to anonymously buy drugs. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained. The authorities said Mr Shrem was aware that the bitcoins were being used for such purchases, and therefore he was in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.  The Act requires financial institutions in the US to alert authorities to any suspicious activity that may suggest money laundering is taking place. Emily Spaven, managing editor of news site Coindesk, told the BBC: ""Since the closure of Silk Road and arrest of alleged owner Ross Ulbricht, we always knew more arrests would follow.  ""It is unfortunate Silk Road continues to make the headlines in association with Bitcoin - this is the dark side of Bitcoin, which the vast majority of digital currency users have no association with."" Following the arrests, James Hunt, from the US Drug Enforcement Agency, said in a statement: ""Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way.  ""Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and distribution, including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye."" Mr Shrem was a founding member and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group set up to promote Bitcoin as an alternative currency - but following his arrest he has since resigned. ""We are surprised and shocked by the news,"" said a spokesman for the organisation. ""As a foundation, we take these allegations seriously and do not condone illegal activity."" BitInstant was one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges on the internet.  However, the service has been inaccessible for some time, explained Mike Hearn, another member of the Bitcoin Foundation. ""Charlie's impact on the Bitcoin community has been hovering near zero for a long time now,"" Mr Hearn told the BBC via email.  ""If the allegations are true, it's part of a phase of Bitcoin's life that the project is rapidly leaving behind (and good riddance)."" BitInstant's investors include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - the twins who previously sued Mark Zuckerberg claiming he had stolen their idea for Facebook. In a statement issued to the BBC, the twins said: ""When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less. ""We are obviously deeply concerned about [Mr Shrem's] arrest. We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.  ""We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.""

236,A Point Of View: Bitcoin's freedom promise,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22292708,2013-04-26 16:47:22+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Bitcoin - a currency free of banks - might have a powerful appeal. But John Gray wonders whether it could become a victim of its own success. Recent events on the small island of Cyprus were always going to have a large impact, but I doubt if anyone suspected the effect would be to boost the growth of a new kind of money. When the new Cypriot president announced in mid-March of this year that the bailout of the country's banks would be funded by seizing a percentage from the accounts of all depositors, there was an outcry. The Cypriot parliament refused to support the policy, which was withdrawn and replaced by a levy on substantial deposits, limits on withdrawals and controls on capital leaving the country. European officials dismissed suggestions that seizing the assets of depositors would be any part of future bailouts. But the damage had been done. Within days of the Cypriot president's announcement, the price of the digital currency Bitcoin began a rapid rise. Fleeing banks and the risk of governments seizing savings, people were switching into a currency that exists only in cyberspace. Listen to A Point of View on the iPlayer BBC Podcasts - A Point of View Cyber money of this kind has a powerful appeal. Traditional currencies such as the pound, the dollar and the euro are issued by central banks and - with the exception of the euro - each of them is backed by a national government. This may seem an advantage but nowadays currencies that are created and ultimately controlled by governments are less trusted than they used to be. While the policies that were adopted in the wake of the financial crash may have saved the world from a rerun of the 1930s, they also mean that money is steadily losing its value as a store of wealth. With near-zero interest rates, small savers are robbed as surely as they would have been if the original Cypriot plan had been implemented, just more slowly. Some try to find shelter in the stock market, but shares have not always given protection against rising prices, and many people can't afford to put their capital at risk in this way. Some seek safety in gold, which functions more like a currency than a commodity and has the advantage of being a finite resource that cannot be created out of nothing like paper currencies. But while gold cannot be printed by governments, it has in practice been closely controlled by them. It has even been claimed that the price of gold has been manipulated, with some suggesting the current sell-off has been somehow orchestrated - an idea that may be mistaken but doesn't seem quite so outlandish now that we know lending rates between banks were for a time rigged on an enormous scale. If you mistrust the financial system, it's not obvious that gold can offer a way out. This is where Bitcoin - which some of its supporters describe as digital gold - comes in.  Of bulbs and bubbles First devised and launched in 2009 by a mysterious figure going under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, the cyber-currency is set up to be independent of monetary authorities and banks. Using publicly available software that operates via a network of about 20,000 powerful computers, units of the cyber-currency are created by the application of a mathematical formula in a process known as ""bitcoin mining"". An upper limit of units is built into the software. Unlike currencies controlled by governments, which can be issued in unlimited quantities, only about 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined.  This means they can't lose value by inflation as all forms of paper money have done over time. Just as important, Bitcoin users needn't entrust their money to banks which will lend it out to others - at times recklessly. Equipped with cryptographic features that promise anonymity, this is a kind of money that seems immune to loss. The appeal of Bitcoin comes from the belief that it enables those who use it to step outside the shaky structures of global finance. But is this faith well-founded? The currency has been criticised as a tool of speculators and money-laundering and its value has oscillated wildly as a result of hacking. Some have condemned it as a Ponzi scheme or a speculative bubble, like the mania for tulip bulbs that raged for a few years in 17th Century Holland. Others have pointed out that since the supply cannot be increased beyond a predetermined point, Bitcoin could be more deflationary in its effects than gold.  If it's successful, the currency will be hoarded and become more valuable than productive economic assets. Yet if these are some of Bitcoin's limitations, they are not the most fundamental. The true flaw of this and any other virtual currency is that it cannot deliver its users from the hazards and conflicts of the real human world. The emergence of Bitcoin confirms that money need not be created by government. Anything people come to view as money can serve some of money's functions without any governmental authorisation. Cigarettes are widely used in prisons as a medium of exchange, and paper currencies have been accepted as money even when they no longer had government backing. After the first Gulf War in 1991, dinars that had been withdrawn by the government of Saddam Hussein were used in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Called ""Swiss dinars"" because they were printed with plates from Switzerland, this illicit currency was soon worth far more than the government-backed dinars Saddam was printing in vast quantities. Swiss dinars remained in use until a new national currency was established following the American-led invasion of 2003 in which Saddam was overthrown.  A virtual currency such as Bitcoin attracts users because it's not subject to any government. At the same time, it needs a margin of freedom in which to operate, and this freedom will be at risk if the financial crisis worsens. When these crises threaten to get out of hand, governments have a habit of confiscating not only the bank accounts but also the freedoms of their citizens.  We're unlikely to see anything like the dictatorships that emerged from the chaos of the 1930s but it's entirely possible that democratic governments will feel the need for controls of the kind that European officials have imposed in Cyprus. Bitcoin's users believe it can give them protection against such incursions.  But governments today have formidable tools of electronic surveillance at their disposal, and it would be unwise to assume that virtual currencies are beyond their reach.   Bitcoin embodies a kind of cyber-anarchism; the idea that the decentralised networks of the internet will enable the ideal of freedom from government, which has eluded so many revolutionaries in the past, to be finally realised. It's a philosophy that shares the fatal illusion of anarchism in all its varieties, the notion that most human beings actually want freedom from government. Invading personal freedom in times of crisis isn't always unpopular - far from it. Not only during the 20th Century but throughout history, human beings have turned to governments, and often to tyrants, for protection and security. The safety they are looking for may be just a mirage. That hasn't stopped them wanting it. ""Bitcoin is for pure financial freedom of speech. It really changes the dynamics of how money works.""

Believers in Bitcoin are confident that it can protect them not just from governments but also against humankind as a whole. Instead of relying on politicians and bankers, or the vagaries of democracy, Bitcoin's users put their faith in the laws of mathematics. For them the cyber-currency is governed by an incorruptible formula that - like the eternal forms envisioned by Plato, immaterial abstract ideas standing outside of time - is untouched by human error and folly.  The trouble is that unlike the tranquil spiritual ether imagined by the ancient Greek mystic, cyber-space is all too clearly a human artefact. A site of unceasing warfare - abounding in worms and viruses, vulnerable to attack and decay, and needing scarce resources and energy to operate - the virtual realm of the internet is a projection of the human world with all its conflicts. A virtual currency can't escape the dangers of actual societies. Cyber money may have many practical uses and provide an alternative to banks. It can't be a way out from history's intractable dilemmas. How Bitcoin will develop cannot be known. Quite possibly it will crash and fail, be supplanted by rival virtual currencies or else shut down by governments because it is succeeding too well. Whatever happens, this will surely not be the last attempt to find freedom in cyberspace. While the freedom Bitcoin promises is an illusion, it's one that will always have a grip on the human mind - the dream of finding some kind of talisman, a benevolent tyrant or a magical new technology, that  can shelter us from power and crime and protect us from each other.

237,Five held over Bitcoin scams in China and Germany,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25217386,2013-12-04 16:41:20+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Suspected Bitcoin fraudsters have been taken into police custody in Germany and China. The German authorities say they arrested two people following an investigation into malware that generated the virtual currency by infecting its victims' PCs. Xinhua reports three people have been detained in China after a trading platform was shut without warning, cutting off investors from their funds. The cases do not appear to be related. The German Federal Criminal Police Office say one of its suspects was arrested in the southern state of Bavaria and the other in the northern region of Lower Saxony. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency. But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for. To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins. This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems. To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins a day. There are currently about 11 million bitcoins in existence. To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned. It accuses them of being behind a botnet that allowed its operators to secretly use other people's computers to carry out ""Bitcoin mining"". The technique - which involves using processing power to solve complicated mathematical problems - is used to create a secure record of Bitcoin transactions.  The incentive for the malware's creators to commit their crime was the fact that Bitcoin miners are rewarded for their help with new bitcoins generated as a side-effect of the process. The reward for each puzzle solved is currently 25 bitcoins, currently worth a total of $29,075 (£17,788).  Bitcoin breached the $1,000 mark for the first time last week. The police say they are also investigating related cases of fraud, copyright violations and offences related to the distribution of pornography. The Chinese case relates to the closure of GBL, an online Bitcoin exchange platform based in Hong Kong, launched in May. According to Xinhua, by the end of September it had 4,493 registered members, and a trading volume that made it the fourth biggest in the country. China's official news agency says that on 26 October the site shut operations, leaving a fake postal address as a contact. It adds that three suspects were subsequently apprehended in different locations on the mainland. The agency says that the amount of money involved is unclear. However, the Hong Kong Standard has previously reported that up to HK$31.8m (£2.5m) was at stake. Bitcoin gained fame in China after film star Jet Li's charity One Foundation received a donation in the currency in April to help the victims of an earthquake. In recent weeks there have been a series of articles highlighting its use as a way to circumvent restrictions on money transfers out of the mainland - a factor that analysts say has helped propel a surge in Bitcoin's value.",0.011924999999999991,0.013630445075757586
238,Bitcoin miners hit back at cyber-thieves,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21964881,2013-03-28 11:07:38+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Cyber-thieves are attempting to cash in on the rising value of the bitcoin virtual currency. Bitcoins have almost tripled in value in a month. In late February one bitcoin was worth £22 ($33) but now each one sells for about £60 ($90). Thieves who run networks of hijacked PCs are increasingly using these machines to create or ""mine"" the coins.  But bitcoin miners say thieves will struggle to keep up, as coin-generating technology becomes more sophisticated. As a virtual currency, bitcoins depend on a wide network of closely connected computers to log who holds the coins and where they are spent.  That network also shares information about who is ""mining"" the coins.  Mining involves solving a hard mathematical problem and miners typically use large numbers of computers to speed up the number crunching involved. ""Botnet mining is fundamentally theft of private property, illegal and unethical,"" Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin developer told the BBC, adding that bitcoin miners had battled botnets for years, seeing them as a ""cost and a burden"" they just had to deal with.  Many cyber-thieves who control botnets, large networks of home PCs compromised with a virus, were using them as a dedicated mining pool in a bid to generate bitcoins for themselves, said Derek Manky, senior security strategist at Fortinet. The operators of one of the biggest current botnets, known as ZeroAccess, had recently ramped up their efforts to use machines they control to mine bitcoins, he said, adding that millions of infected PCs were unwittingly enrolled in the criminal network. ""ZeroAccess has employed an affiliate model,"" he said. ""They pay other people to install malware for them."" The operators of ZeroAccess were making so much money that they were paying high prices for each infection. Current rates ran at about $100 (£65) for every 1,000 infections, said Mr Manky. As well as mining bitcoins, PCs enrolled in ZeroAccess were also being used to poison search results - to cause users to unwittingly click on booby-trapped web pages - or fraudulently click on adverts to generate revenue. ""ZeroAccess has been extremely profitable,"" said Mr Manky.  The wider bitcoin community was aware of the efforts botnet owners were making to produce their own cash, said Mr Manky. ""They try to detect and remove these transactions but it's a bit of a cat and mouse game,"" he said. ""The operators of ZeroAccess know about that and just change their tactics."" However, said Mr Garzik, criminal participation in bitcoin mining was likely to get much less profitable as professional miners turned away from using desktop PCs to generate the coins.  Increasingly, he said, professional miners were using custom-made chips, called Asics (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), to mine because such processors worked faster. ""It is theorised that the current shift in bitcoin mining to 'Asic' miners - the fastest and most advanced generation - will simply make it unprofitable for botnet miners,"" said Mr Garzik.   Vitalik Buterin, technical editor at Bitcoin Magazine, said the the rise of Asic mining meant cyber-thieves would soon be pushed out. Currently, he said, only about one-third of all professional miners were using Asics, but as that proportion grew, the number of bitcoins that could be generated with a botnet would shrink. ""The fact that botnets are (somewhat) viable now is basically an aberration resulting from the massive price increase that has not yet been matched by increased mining activity,"" he said. "" Once Bitcoin stabilises again the botnets will rapidly crawl back into the shadows.""",-0.006492000000000005,0.019311904761904763

The site is the sequel to his site Megaupload, shut down a year ago at the urging of the US government. Mega follows social news site Reddit and blogging platform WordPress in accepting bitcoin payments. Mr Dotcom, who awaits a hearing relating to criminal charges, in part, about pirated material on his original site, announced the move on Twitter. ""#Mega now accepts #BITCOIN via our newest reseller Bitvoucher: https://bitvoucher.co/ ,"" the founder posted on Saturday. The virtual currency can be used to pay for extra storage space on the service. Mega offers 50GB of free cloud storage, with the option to pay for extra storage ranging from 500GB to 4TB. The exchange rate for one bitcoin currently stands at close to £17 ($26). The cheapest package of 500GB costs 9.99 euros ($13.32; £8.61) per month - or half a bitcoin. To pay in the internet currency, users need to access BitVoucher, the website of Mega's new reseller. Mega was launched in January, a year after Mr Dotcom - originally called Kim Schmitz - was arrested, and his original site Megaupload shut down.  It will be decided in March whether he should be extradited from New Zealand to the US to face charges relating to copyright infringement. Megaupload became one of the most popular websites on the web before it was shut down, but Mega is meant to be bigger, better and legally watertight. The new site allows 50GB of free storage upon sign-up - more than twice the amount if the user is signed up for free accounts with Google, Apple, Microsoft and Dropbox put together. It is a site advertised as being a place where lots of files can be stored securely and accessed by the user, from any computer. The content is encrypted, so even staff at Mega need the user's key to unlock it. But the key can be shared and the files might not just be family photos or a home recording. And this is where infringing copyright could, once again, become a problem. Bitcoins first appeared in 2009 and are closely linked to the global network of computers that supports the currency and its users. Many people generate or ""mine"" the coins by participating in that network, and a growing number of web stores and online firms accept bitcoins as payment.",0.144085,0.09971590909090909

BitTag uses wireless technology to connect to the internet and check the value of Bitcoin, altering the tag display once a minute. Its creator hopes it will allow shops put off by Bitcoin's volatility to adopt the virtual currency. Bitcoin's value has surged and crashed often in recent months. Often, this has been down to high-profile hacks, or as a result of governments around the world, particularly China, commenting on the currency's future legal status.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained. Governments are keen to assert some control over a currency that has to date gained most attention as a method of anonymously buying drugs online. But the currency's backers and enthusiasts have stepped up efforts to show Bitcoin's other uses. ""Bitcoin is becoming more popular,"" said BitTag's creator, Samuel Cox, who describes himself as a creative technologist.   ""But there's a lack of infrastructure for people to buy things in the physical world because the value changes all the time."" In the past 12 months, Bitcoin's value has peaked at over $1000 (£615), but at times was as low as $421. The prototype BitTag device, which costs about £40, displays local currency as well as the Bitcoin price. By connecting to a tablet via Bluetooth, the device is able to check the latest value of Bitcoin and change its display accordingly. From here, a shopper can initiate a sale. ""[The] Bitcoin transaction can be activated by a simple 'shake' of the BitTag,"" the product's website explains. ""Enabling a Bitcoin QR code to be displayed on the display and scanned by the user's smartphone."" Due to the much higher cost compared with a standard price tag, Mr Cox conceded that BitTag's appeal was likely to be niche and more suited to ""quirky"" shops than major stores. Other attempts to bring the virtual currency into the real world include a Bitcoin cash machine shown off last year. Last month, Cumbria University said it would allow some students to pay their tuition fees using the currency. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC",0.18500000000000003,0.08743617493617493

He contends that Mr Hollande is reaping the consequences of using the media and ""celebrity culture"" to rise to fame and power. ""His personal life was thrown to the mercy of the public because it was, in reality, closely tied to his political life,"" he writes (translated by Worldcrunch). BBC Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt gives a run-down of the implications of the alleged affair both for Mr Hollande and the French economy.

243,Is blockchain living up to the hype?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45919700,2018-10-22 23:17:55+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"As we approach Bitcoin's 10th anniversary at the end of this month, we ask whether blockchain - the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency - is fulfilling its promise, or a tech still looking for a better reason to exist. There have been some very grandiose claims made about blockchain.  Some say it could help solve the Irish border issue currently bedevilling Brexit negotiations, or enable people to find love, or even end world poverty.  A daily barrage of press releases claim it will ""revolutionise"" business. But what's the reality? Well, let's start with the basics. At its heart, blockchain is a relatively straightforward concept. It is a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. This information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government. Once published, the information in a certain block can't be changed. If people try to tamper with that information, it becomes obvious. This is a powerful concept. Ten years ago, blockchain was combined with other technologies to create cryptocurrencies, and the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, blames the hype on the cryptocurrency gold rush that has seen billions flow into the hundreds of digital currencies now on the market. ""The reason people followed this stuff is because of the promise that you can get rich for free. That's a very powerful promise,"" he says. ""This is why we have Bitcoin mining wasting a whole country's electricity."" Tech vendors and consultants have fanned the flames, trying to cash in on the mania, Mr Gerard believes. ""It's magic beans,"" he says. ""But it turns out magic doesn't happen.  ""All the people selling magical flying unicorn ponies, and writing in detail about the measurements of the wing feathers, are ignoring that unicorns don't exist."" The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist) warned in a recent paper, that: ""There is hype around the use of blockchain technology, yet the technology is not well understood.  ""It is not magical; it will not solve all problems. As with all new technology, there is a tendency to want to apply it to every sector in every way imaginable."" Gartner analyst Rajesh Kandaswamy says that even though speculators mostly see blockchain as ""a mechanism to make money, that doesn't invalidate the technology"". The ability for two parties to interact without a middleman is a ""fascinating concept"". Smart contracts - self-executing agreements between buyers and sellers recorded on a blockchain - are ""really powerful"", he says, as is the idea of a decentralised digital identity. It would mean that rather than storing personal details with one firm such as Facebook, users would be able to store their encrypted details over a network. ""There are so many possibilities. We haven't even scratched the surface yet,"" Mr Kandaswamy adds. Few firms have fully embraced blockchain, according to consultancy Capgemini. In a recent survey of firms looking to use the tech, 3% had large-scale use, 10% were piloting it, while 87% had only tested blockchain proofs of concept. Perhaps the best-known start-up using it is Ripple, the payment settling system and currency exchange proving popular with financial institutions around the world, including Bank of America and Santander.  And there is a lot of interest among the very biggest companies. More Technology of Business For example, IBM is working with US retail giant Walmart to track food through its global supply chain, and with shipping company Maersk on developing a platform for the container shipping industry. ""We're still in the early days in terms of technology,"" admits Marie Wieck, general manager for IBM Blockchain.  While some firms are still what IBM would describe as ""blockchain tourists"", and are not completely sure how they can use the technology, others are further advanced in their plans, she says. The firm is also looking at how blockchain can be used in trade finance and banking. There is also huge interest in the tech in Asia, says Mr Kandaswamy. Chinese retail giant Alibaba is using blockchain with its subsidiary payment platform Alipay, while fellow e-commerce titan JD.com is selling blockchain services to other firms.  And media conglomerate Tencent was part of a group that set up a blockchain security alliance, according to the China News Service. Blockchain is quite slow and energy hungry, critics say, making it difficult to scale up. And its distributed, uneditable, anonymous nature seems to create as many problems as it seeks to solve. ""Peer-to-peer transfer systems that cut out middlemen were born from libertarianism, and are almost anarchic in their nature,"" says Robert Zapfel, technical director of iov42, a platform aiming to ""deliver on the promise of blockchain"" by making all the competing technologies interoperable. ""You don't know what will happen to them tomorrow. And who serves the 98% in the middle?"" But mostly the scepticism is born from a ""disconnect between the hype and the reality"" of a tech still in its very early stages, says Mr Kandaswamy. ""The claim is that it is transforming industry. It is not. It's another way to sell new services that vendors are pushing a lot,"" he says. But ""blockchain has a lot of believers"".",0.1009195652173913,0.14543137116506683

The MoneySavingExpert website founder had claimed the fake endorsements had caused him reputational damage. He said he had dropped the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce a scam ads reporting button. As part of the deal, Facebook will also give £3m to Citizens Advice.  The organisation will use the money for a scheme to identify and fight online scams and support their victims. The project is set to launch in May. It will include work to develop tools to help the public identify such fraudulent activity. Facebook's investment will be made over a three-year period and consist of £2.5m in cash and a further £500,000 worth of advertising credit. ""The amount being donated to set up the Citizens Advice scams action project is far above anything I could've won had I succeeded in a court,"" Mr Lewis said in a statement. ""The aim of my campaigning lawsuit was always to stop scam ads and to help those who have fallen victim to them.  ""What we're announcing today does that at a far bigger scale than I could've hoped for."" Mr Lewis announced his decision at a joint press conference with Facebook in London, which was  live-streamed on Facebook. He said that more than 1,000 bogus adverts had appeared on Facebook bearing his image and/or name. Some of these had pictured him giving advice on ITV's This Morning programme, while others bore the BBC logo as part of efforts to give the schemes credibility. Several claimed to involve crypto-currency speculation but Mr Lewis said they were often fronts for binary trading companies based outside of the EU, which the public would be ill advised to get involved with. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned consumers to be wary of binary option trading, saying it is a form of fixed-odds betting that typically results in losses. Facebook had initially defended its role, saying it would deal with any ads brought to its attention that infringed Mr Lewis's rights. But the campaigner accused the US company of being ineffective due to its reliance on user reports. At Wednesday's press conference, however, Mr Lewis said that after he had threatened to sue Facebook, the company had ""quickly realised the scale of the problem"" and agreed to commit resources to tackle the issue. Facebook's new scam ad reporting button promises to make it easier for users to flag promotions they suspect to be scams. The tech firm has pledged to support the service with a ""dedicated internal operations team"" whose job it will be to investigate the reports as well as to proactively identify related ad trends that amount to an abuse of its platforms. Facebook's regional director for northern Europe, Steve Hatch, said: ""We're grateful to Martin Lewis for bringing attention to this important issue and for his guidance over the last eight months."" Mr Lewis added that he hoped Google and other advertising platforms would also accept they needed to make improvements and should ""put their hands in their pockets"" to support Citizen Advice's work.",-0.11512857142857143,0.00900673400673401

Its appreciation - up from just $2 in November 2011 - has been attributed to increased trust in security efforts. The surge coincided with Japan-based MT Gox, Bitcoin's biggest exchange, announcing a tie-up with US firm CoinLab to bring its operations to the States. However, recent high-profile thefts continue to worry some investors. In September last year, 24,000 Bitcoins - which at the time were worth £157,800 - were stolen from another large exchange, Bitfloor. In June 2011, a huge instance of fraud led to a market crash, with the value of Bitcoins at one point plummeting to almost zero. But since then the currency has steadied somewhat, thanks in part to adoption by key websites such as Reddit and Kim Dotcom's file storage site Mega. Other reasons given for the rise in value include the popularity of gambling websites accepting the currency. Bitcoin casinos have been reported to be bringing in about $500,000 (£330,000) profit every six months - with more growth expected. Unlike other currencies, Bitcoins are not issued by a central bank or other centralised authority. Instead they are created in a process called ""mining"", in which coins are issued to a user when they solve a complicated mathematical problem using their computer. Part of the attraction is they can be used to make transactions that are difficult to trace, offering privacy to their users, and the currency has been adopted by Wikileaks and other sites to receive donations. Bitcoins can also be exchanged for ""real"" money - the value of which is tracked by services like Mt Gox.  Mt Gox's move to the States was announced in a statement from Peter Vessenes, chief executive of CoinLab, the firm that will administer the exchange in the US, in partnership with Silicon Valley Bank. ""There are two major difficulties Bitcoin exchange customers have traditionally faced: banking troubles for the underlying exchange, and security of their coins,"" he said.

247,Bitcoin thieves yet to spend stolen hoard,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19633980,2012-09-19 07:17:06+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Cyberthieves who stole more than $250,000 (£158,000) in digital money are still sitting on the cash. The haul, in what is known as bitcoins, was stolen in a raid on the Bitfloor online currency exchange this month. Bitfloor boss Roman Shtylman said transaction-tracking technology in the bitcoin system showed the money had not been spent. The robbery forced Bitfloor to close but Mr Shtylman said he was working on ways to relaunch the exchange. Although bitcoins can be used to buy and sell, the digital currency is not minted by a nation. Instead bitcoins are ""mined"" by people getting their computer to perform a complicated and time-consuming mathematical problem. Bitcoins are spent by assigning the private key associated with them to someone else. The robbery on Bitfloor got hold of the private keys of many of the exchange's customers, thereby handing control of those bitcoins to the robbers. Because all transactions with bitcoins are public, said Mr Shtylman, everyone who used the coins knew that the thieves had yet to start spending their ill-gotten gains. Digital detective work carried out soon after the theft showed that it was carried out via an IP address based in Moscow, he said. No transactions had been recorded using the stolen coins since they had been taken. ""They have not been moved,"" Mr Shtylman told the BBC. ""We may not know who the person is but we can see what they are doing with the fund."" He speculated that the thieves were sitting on their pile of digital cash because the money was still ""hot"". The thieves may be looking at ways to launder the money, he said, by putting it into bitcoin wallets they controlled and then converting it into other, real-world, currencies. Mr Shtylman said a crime report about the theft had been filed with the FBI, which was believed to be investigating. Prior to the raid Bitfloor was the largest bitcoin exchange in America and the fourth-largest in the world. Mr Shtylman said he was now looking at how best to relaunch Bitfloor. ""Given the amount of money involved it will take time to solve these problems and find ways to pay people back,"" he said, adding that most of the currency traders who used Bitfloor were sticking with him.  ""A lot of people want to see the exchange return and continue trading,"" he said.",-0.17652631578947373,0.056140350877192984
248,Bitcoin value drops after FBI shuts Silk Road drugs site,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24381847,2013-10-03 12:37:01+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The value of bitcoins has dropped after the closure of the clandestine Silk Road online marketplace. The FBI seized bitcoins worth approximately $3.6m (£2.2m) on Tuesday. The price of a bitcoin, a virtual currency for use online, fell steeply after the arrest of suspected website administrator Ross Ulbricht. Investor confidence may have been shaken by the association of bitcoins with illegal activity, according to a security expert. ""When there's a big bust, that's going to knock people's confidence in investing,"" said Rik Ferguson, a senior researcher at security company Trend Micro. ""The more a currency is associated with illegal activity, the more people will be nervous about using it,"" he said. Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency. Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be better to think of its units as being virtual tokens that have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each bitcoin is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"", which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with bitcoins. To receive a bitcoin, a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27 to 34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins contained. News of the closure was followed by a rapid drop in the price of bitcoins, according to figures from the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange. The going rate for the virtual currency dropped from more than $140 (£86) to around $110, before climbing back up to $123 (£75). Investors may have been concerned about the FBI's ability to confiscate bitcoins, said Mr Ferguson. ""Knowing that a currency could be seized or shut down could pressure people to look for alternative investment vehicles,"" he said. The FBI seized the virtual currency by getting hold of encryption keys for the bitcoins, according to Jerry Brito, George Mason University's technology policy director. The keys were made available through seized computer equipment, Mr Brito said in a blog post. The FBI then transferred the bitcoins to an address controlled by the US government, according to the seizure order (PDF). ",0.03486799999999999,0.014171717171717167

""In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling [virtual currencies],"" the bank said in a statement.

Entrepreneur Taylor More listed his two-bedroom Alberta bungalow, asking 405,000 Canadian dollars (£261,000; $395,000) - or the equivalent in Bitcoins. He says the first reaction of his family was that of a shock. Bitcoins are now a widely used alternative payments system and one Bitcoin is currently worth about £37. ""Bitcoins are really hard to get your hands on if you want to get them in large quantities,"" Mr More told the BBC. ""I have a couple projects that I want to get started, and they will take a lot of Bitcoins."" He did not get into detail on his new venture, only saying that it should ""get Bitcoins more mainstream"". Unlike other currencies, Bitcoins are not issued by a central bank or other centralised authority.  They first appeared in 2009 and are closely linked to the global network of computers which supports the currency and its users. People generate or ""mine"" Bitcoins by participating in that network - for instance, by solving a complicated mathematical problem using their computer. A growing number of web stores and online firms accept Bitcoins as payment.  Bitcoins can be exchanged for ""real"" money, and they can be used to make transactions that are difficult to trace, offering privacy to their users.  The currency has been adopted by Wikileaks and other sites to receive donations. ""It's an instant form of payment, and there's very low cost transfer fees,"" said Mr More. ""When you send money internationally it takes a week or more to do and costs hundreds of dollars, so I see this as something we've needed, an online virtual currency to make payments fast and easy.""  The use of Bitcoins has been slowly spilling from the online into the physical world - for example, it is now possible to use the currency to buy pizza.",0.03294285714285715,0.08966965574108433
251,Bitcoin 'will recover' from crash,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13857192,2011-06-21 23:11:04+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The virtual currency Bitcoin will ""bounce back"" after a hack attack caused its value to collapse, according to one of its senior developers. Gavin Andresen said he hoped the crisis would lead to better security on sites where Bitcoins are bought and sold. Prices on the main exchange, Mt.Gox, fell from $17.50 (£10.80) to almost zero when a large number of stolen Bitcoins were dumped on the market. Trading was suspended and eventually rolled back to pre-crash rates. Mt.Gox revealed details of the security breach on June 20 with an announcement on its website. ""It appears that someone who performs audits on our system and had read-only access to our database had their computer compromised. This allowed for someone to pull our database,"" the statement read. Around the same time, an unidentified person accessed one of the compromised accounts and sold all of its Bitcoins. They then attempted to buy the coins again and withdraw them in US dollars. The fraudster was partially foiled when they hit Mt.Gox's $1000 daily limit. The decision to reset the Bitcoin rate to a point just before the malicious trades were placed was criticised by some users who had taken the opportunity to buy low. ""Why should everyone who profited from the crash suffer your inability to secure the site?"" wrote a user called Elments. Although the problem was caused by security failings at Mt.Gox, it has raised wider questions about the viability of Bitcoin as a virtual currency. ""I am sceptical about its longer term prospects,"" said David Birch, director of Consult Hyperion, a consultancy specialising in electronic transactions. ""There were two things here - the specific bubble (caused by the dumping of stolen coins) and the exchange mechanism."" Bitcoin transactions are made by swapping anonymous, heavily encrypted codes which only a specific user can unlock. Details of who owns each Bitcoin are distributed across a peer-to-peer network, with no central repository. If an encrypted coin file is deleted, the money is lost. The system has proved popular with online criminals, keen to keep their financial transactions secret, although it has a wider, legitimate, user base. Mr Birch said the fact that so many Bitcoins were traded on a single exchange made it vulnerable to market shocks. He also questioned the fundamental workings of the currency, saying that its emphasis on anonymity and decentralised nature meant there was little recourse for users when things go wrong. The online freedom group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it was dropping Bitcoin as a means of donating to its cause because of concerns about consumer protection, taxation and money laundering. On the same day as the crash, the EFF's legal director Cindy Cohn wrote: ""Since there is no caselaw on this topic, and the legal implications are still very unclear, we worry that our acceptance of Bitcoins may move us into the possible subject role."" Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen conceded that current safeguards around the currency may be inadequate. ""I have been the person saying that Bitcoin is an experiment, so you can have confidence in it as much as you can have confidence in any start-up,"" he said. ""Like any start-up, it could change the world but it could also be risk."" ",-0.1915333333333333,0.030617559523809526

In February, Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi announced a plan to develop Iran's own virtual currency.  Mr Jahromi's project was also backed by Iran's cyber-security authority, which said it would support virtual currencies if they were properly regulated.  But the central bank did not agree.

253,Bitcoin theft causes Bitfloor exchange to go offline,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19486695,2012-09-05 12:06:41+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"One of the biggest Bitcoin currency exchanges has been taken offline after 24,000 units ($250,000; £157,800) of the virtual currency were stolen from its computer servers. Bitcoins can be used for online money transfers and trades, and the currency uses cryptography to protect it. But Bitfloor's founder, Roman Shtylman, said he had kept unencrypted ""keys"", which the thief accessed and used to take the money. Bitfloor's future is now in doubt. Mr Shtylman said his New York-based service was the biggest of its kind in the US and the fourth largest in the world. Creating e-cash Unlike other currencies, Bitcoins are not issued by a central bank or other centralised authority. Instead they are created in a process called ""mining"", in which coins are issued to a user when they solve a complicated mathematical problem using their computer.  The complexity of the problems is determined by the number of ""miners"", to ensure there is not a flood of new currency. Most people using Bitcoins do not create cash in this manner, but rather use currency exchanges - such as Bitfloor - to purchase them. Part of the attraction is they can be used to make transactions that are difficult to trace, offering privacy to their users, and the currency has been adopted by Wikileaks and other sites to receive donations. Effectively Bitcoins are a very long meaningless string of digits that only have value if their owner uses a shorter related number, known as a private key, to spend them.  The key identifies the address the currency is stored at, allowing the currency to be accessed and transferred to a new owner, who then stores it at a new address safeguarded by a different key. It is therefore critical that a user protects their keys to secure their Bitcoins - and the Bitfloor exchange used encryption to protect its store. But Mr Shtylman acknowledged on a forum that he had recently carried out an upgrade of his systems and stored an unencrypted copy of the keys during the process, which the thief took advantage of. ""I realise this is a very serious mistake,"" he wrote. He added the thief had taken the vast majority of the currency that he had been holding at the time, meaning he could not cover all his users' account balances. However, he added that account details had not been compromised. ""As a last resort, I will be forced to fully shut Bitfloor down and initiate account repayment using current available funds,"" he wrote. ""I still have all of the logs for accounts, trades, transfers. I know how much each user currently has in their account for both US dollars and Bitcoins. No records were lost in this attack."" This is not the first attack on a Bitcoin exchange.  UK-based Bitcoinica was hacked twice this year and subsequently sued by several of its users after they had alleged it was not able to honour their withdrawal requests. The firm has since ceased operations for what it terms ""a transition period"". Last year another exchange, Japan's MtGox, suspended operations for several days after one of its accounts was compromised causing the currency to plummet in value. The service acted to compensate users who had been caught up in the sell-off. ",-0.03897692307692307,-0.005246697746697746

Blacking out and vomiting after injecting illegal drugs and having them sent from China disguised as dog flea treatment, are some examples. Each year, 15,400 people in the UK are diagnosed with Melanoma - the most aggressive type of skin cancer. While more survive, a ""tsunami of new cases"" is feared by Dr Rachel Abbott. The British Skin Foundation spokeswoman said people were resorting to ""risky behaviour"" as they tried to achieve the sort of tans glamorised by celebrities in some reality shows. ""I would have to be hospitalised to stop,"" said Karl Dinis, from Cardiff, who injects himself with Melanotan 2. Originally developed to treat UV-related skin disorders, it is a hormone which, when injected, produces a dark pigment called melanin. It is illegal to sell or supply it in the UK, as it is unregulated, but, despite repeated warnings about the associated dangers and reported side-effects, some tanners continue to use it.  Karl has it sent from China disguised as dog flea treatment or expired food. ""Unless someone told me that I was seriously ill and it was related to the tanning injection, and they could prove it, why would I stop?"" added the 36-year-old. Despite spending about £18,000 on a product which contains Melanotan 2 he admits he has no idea what is in the drug he buys on Whatsapp using Bitcoin. The care worker started using sunbeds when he was 17, before moving on to injections about 10 years ago, after a friend gave him the drug.  He has experienced nausea, headaches and hot flushes, but injects most nights before bed, sometimes double and triple dosing to get the desired result. ""The last package I received came marked and boxed dog flea treatment, the one before was gone off food... they have to do that to get it through British customs,"" he said. ""I know it's the Melanotan - it doesn't bother me. Every time it comes in different packaging, but as long as the powder is in the bottle, it's fine."" Mike Mallet, of the Newport needle exchange, said steroid users also took the tanning drug, as it can counteract erectile dysfunction, a common side-effect of steroids.  He said he had spoken to women who had ""jabbing parties"", where they inject Melanotan together, and had seen people who had developed sores and open wounds from it. The drug continues to be marketed online by companies promising a quick, even tan, when the user's skin is exposed to UV rays - either in natural sunshine or on a tanning bed.  So far no-one has been prosecuted for its sale in the UK, and one company, apparently based in Cardiff, offers Melanotan on Facebook for as little as £16.  While the long-term effects are not known, people have reported 111 potential side-effects to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the last 10 years. The agency said it was ""potentially dangerous"" and people should ""stop using it immediately"". Iwan Steffan's mum died when he was 13 from skin cancer.  He said he no longer risks his health for a tan, but for years the salon worker from near Bethesda, Gwynedd, went on sunbeds twice a day, before starting to inject Melanotan.  ""The colour was really dark, I would describe it as like corned beef,"" said Iwan, who would top up the look with fake tan. ""I was the type of person people would see in the street and they would go, 'oh my god, look at him', but I liked that sort of attention."" But the 28-year-old, who now lives in Liverpool, stopped using it when he started to black out. ""If I could speak to my younger self now I would be saying I am ridiculous, how could I abuse myself like that,"" he said. Dr Abbott said she was shocked by the level of risk people were taking to achieve a tan, but that it was hard to get the message home about the damage UV and injections could cause. ""Just embrace your own skin tone, rather than try to change the colour of your skin and potentially put your life at risk,"" she said.",-0.11013793103448276,-0.00046260013932427317
255,Bitcoin: Dawn of a new currency or destined to fail?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22152213,2013-04-16 23:14:08+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Who would have thought one of the tech wizards behind a global currency would live in a squat?  Amir Taaki is a developer who works with a virtual currency called Bitcoin. His home and office is an abandoned Buddhist temple. The dwelling is covered in brightly painted but slowly decaying murals of Buddha, with the odd makeshift bunk bed and flotsam furniture like a couch with no pillows. His fellow squatters are members of the Occupy movement and Mr Taaki's Bitcoin philosophy is very much in line with theirs.  ""Bitcoin is for pure financial freedom of speech,"" he says. ""It really changes the dynamics of how money works."" Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be best to think of its units as being virtual tokens which have value because enough people believe they do and there is a finite number of them. Each of the 11 million Bitcoins currently in existence is represented by a unique online registration number. These numbers are created through a process called ""mining"" which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution. Each time a problem is solved the computer's owner is rewarded with 25 Bitcoins.  To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day. To receive a Bitcoin a user must also have a Bitcoin address - a randomly generated string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox to and from which the Bitcoins are sent. Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction. These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings. They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins contained. His voice exudes passion for the currency. ""Bitcoin is the proper perfect economy,"" he says. ""The technology needed to participate is open, the entry and exit is basically very cheap or free, there's no barriers to competing in that network."" The currency exists exclusively online and is independent of any government or company.  It was spawned in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Early adopters, including Mr Taaki, were mostly tech-minded people with distrust in regulated banking institutions. Like other currencies it is used to buy goods and services. Companies selling anything from software, pizza and online dating are jumping on board - accepting it as payment.  But what makes Bitcoin attractive to many of its users is its relative anonymity.  ""You can make as many Bitcoin addresses as you want,"" Mr Taaki says.  ""So that's how you preserve your anonymity because you give every person a different Bitcoin address so they don't know what Bitcoins are connected to you."" Because Bitcoins are hard to regulate and transactions tough to trace, the currency is a haven for black market activity spearheaded by an online marketplace for illegal drugs and fake IDs called Silk Road. Silk Road accepts Bitcoins as payment. ""It's a really powerful thing,"" says Mr Taaki.  The activist says Bitcoin's use on Silk Road has been a good thing for libertarian reasons - but adds that there is also potential for less controversial uses of the currency which are not easily supported by the current banking system. Silk Road is the Amazon of the black market world, best known for selling illegal drugs online.  Its popularity stems from the user's ability to buy drugs without having to pay using a traditional bank account. This provides an element of anonymity to the transaction.  The website uses software called Tor and the Bitcoin currency to hide customer information and the location of its servers.  Silk Road, like mainstream online marketplaces, allows users to rate and review products.  Apart from drugs, it has a wide range of products on offer like clothing, books and pornography.  ""You can make distributed, publicly funded services using Bitcoin, you can have micro-philanthropy,"" he exclaims. ""A lot of people think our financial problems should be solved by laying on more regulation but the thing with that regulation is it enforces monopoly. It puts more power into the guys who can comply with that regulation."" ""It closes out the idealistic guys at the bottom who actually want to change things."" The currency's links to illegal activity have not deterred people from becoming interested in it.  Demand has recently been bolstered by distrust in traditional financial institutions stoked by the banking crisis in Cyprus.  This, along with speculative investors, caused the value of a Bitcoin unit to double in a matter of weeks. It has since become more volatile, experiencing a drop of over half of its value in one day.  According to data from Bitcoin Charts, the past week alone has seen the value of one Bitcoin range from $266 (£172) to $50 (£32). Bitcoin saw a similar boom in 2011 followed by a crash. Its unpredictable nature has incited a fear of history repeating itself but Chris Cook, a senior fellow at University College London's Institute for Security and Resilience Studies says the volatile nature of the currency is just a symptom of changing supply and demand.  ""At the moment it's increasing rapidly because there's a massive interest in it,"" he says. ""Once that demand ceases it may stabilise. On the other hand other people may come in and say 'oh I made a lot of money on my Bitcoins, I might sell some,' - in which case we would see the price come down."" But the Bitcoin system isn't airtight. There have been a number of Bitcoin thefts by hackers and even a Ponzi scheme cheating investors out of millions of dollars. Mr Cook says that's just the cost of doing business.  ""Bitcoin is disruptive, it's changing the game completely, but it is fundamentally flawed,"" he says. ""If you get hold of a code, a Bitcoin code, then it's yours. As far as that goes, whoever had it has lost it. It's like a bare instrument, it's like a coin."" Bitcoin's recent volatility has prompted several commentators to claim the innovation should be viewed as a kind of commodity rather than a new type of cash. Like a commodity Bitcoin is not controlled by a government or central bank. Furthermore, although new units are still being produced, the system is designed to max out at 21 million Bitcoins in about 30 years time.  Just as the limited amount of gold in the ground affects the precious metal's value, so too is Bitcoin's value influenced by this artificially imposed cap. That poses a potential problem because the amount of things Bitcoins can be used to buy are increasing. As a result, it is said, Bitcoin suffers from a deflationary bias: each unit should be able to buy more goods in the future than it can today - the opposite of how currencies normally work. This creates an incentive for owners to hoard rather than spend which could further pump up its value since this behaviour effectively removes units from the economy. Meanwhile a lack of knowledge about what range Bitcoin ought to be trading within has made the innovation prone to the kind of short term swings in value uncommon to currencies.  That in turn has attracted the kind of speculators who would usually invest in exotic commodities or stocks, willing to take take big risks in exchange for the promise of huge rewards. Mr Cook adds that it's an attractive outlet for virtual crime.  ""The more expensive it gets the more you'll find that all the world's online criminals focus and descend upon the people who have access to Bitcoins.""  This hasn't stopped Bitcoin's users from believing and investing in the currency.  Jeff Berwick is one such entrepreneur. He has developed the first Bitcoin cash machine, which will convert a person's Bitcoins into the currency of the country where they are withdrawn.  ""Over 200 people have said they're interested in buying a machine or more than one from 30 different countries,"" he says. He says he plans to put one of his first machines in Cyprus where the amount of money people can take out of machines is restricted because of strict financial regulations.  ""This is a way to transact outside of the traditional, regulatory monetary system,"" he says. However, optimistic Bitcoin supporters are, the future of the currency is hazy and unpredictable.  But Mr Cook says he believes the importance of Bitcoin does not revolve around the currency itself, but rather the concept of alternative currencies and their place in the global economy.  ""It's a sign of the way that things are going to go,"" he says.  ""Networked currency and networked transactions are going to look very different from the banking system that we know.""",0.10428873239436619,0.08183809930288805

Bitcoinica suffered an attack earlier this year and the theft of $228,000 (£145,000) of the virtual currency. The users said the site neglected to keep money safe, and has not honoured a promise to return lost funds. They have asked for $460,458 in costs and damages. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer powered currency consisting of anonymous, heavily-encrypted codes which only a specific user can unlock. The ""real world"" value of Bitcoin fluctuates heavily, but current prices put their worth at about $10 (£6.30) for each Bitcoin unit, written as BTC. Technology news website Ars Technica reported that Bitcoinica suffered a loss of more than 43,000 BTC in a security breach in March. Ten days later the site was hit again. At the time, Bitcoinica assured users: ""The overwhelming majority of our Bitcoin deposits were not stolen. The thief stole from us not you. All withdrawal requests will be honoured."" However, in court filings, four users said that only half of their Bitcoins have been returned.

The Pizza for Coins service has been set up by two programmers as a way to boost use of the digital cash. The service acts as a middleman and converts bitcoins into US dollars that are used to pay for food. It charges a small fee to do the currency exchange.  Paying via bitcoins can also delay an order, warn the site owners, saying the conversion can mean pizza takes up to 80 minutes to be delivered. While orders for pizza are placed on the Pizza for Coins site, once payment is made they are funnelled to the website of Domino's pizza to be made and delivered. Links to other pizza companies, such as Pizza Hut and Papa John, would be added soon, said programmers Matt Burkinshaw and Riley Alexander in an explanatory note on the site. The site, which only works with US addresses, currently offers a limited range of pizzas and toppings. A medium pizza with two toppings costs about 0.71 bitcoins (£12). Paying via the digital currency also adds a 0.09 bitcoin (£1.50) premium to the price of a pizza to convert the digital money to real dollars. The service's owners said this conversion charge might change as exchange rates for bitcoins had fluctuated widely. If the service proved successful, charges would be reduced, said its creators. Bitcoins first appeared in 2009 and are closely linked to the global network of computers that supports the currency and its users. Many people generate or ""mine"" the coins by participating in that network and a growing number of web stores and online firms accept bitcoins as payment.  They have become a very widely used alternative payments system and one bitcoin is currently worth about £17 ($26).",0.06125333333333334,0.054079365079365074

The website currently contains a message written in English, demanding a ransom of 0.1 bitcoin - worth $927.86 (£664.98) by today's exchange rate. Ukranian cyber-police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko said the attack is an ""isolated incident"" and no other government websites have been affected. She added that the energy ministry's email system was still up and running. ""This case is not large-scale. If necessary, we are ready to react and help,"" said Ms Kvitko. ""Our specialists are working right now... We do not know how long it will take to resolve the issue."" According to cyber-security research firm AlienVault, the hackers behind this cyber-attack have previously compromised other websites, but they have only made about £100 from their efforts. AlienVault believes the energy ministry website has been attacked by two different hackers - the first hacker, who signs his name ""X-zakaria"" at the bottom of the webpage, merely defaced the website.  The security firm believes that a second hacker then came along, encrypted the website's files, and added a ransomware screen and payment details.  ""What has probably happened here is that a hacktivist has hacked the site for fun, then the criminal ransomware attacker has used their backdoor, which you can see at the bottom of the page, to try and make some money,"" AlienVault security researcher Chris Doman told the BBC. He said that it was likely that these hackers were amateurs, rather than nation state attackers.  ""It's certainly true that attacks against Ukraine have impersonated ransomware before, to cover their true aim of pure destruction, and in many cases, energy companies such as this have been a prime target,"" said Mr Doman.

Matthew Hanley, 23, and Connor Allsopp, 21, both from Tamworth in Staffordshire, admitted their roles in the massive 2015 data breach which saw 156,959 accounts accessed. Hanley, described as a ""dedicated hacker"", shared details of more than 8,000 customers with Allsopp. At the Old Bailey, Hanley was jailed for 12 months and Allsopp for eight. Sentencing, Judge Anuja Dhir QC said they were ""individuals of extraordinary talent"". ""I'm sure that your actions caused misery and distress to the many thousands of the customers at TalkTalk,"" she said. The court accepted that neither Hanley, of Devonshire Drive, nor Allsopp, of Coronation Street, had ""exposed the vulnerability in [TalkTalk's] systems... but you at different times joined in,"" Judge Dhir said. In November 2015, a 17-year-old boy admitted posting details of a chink in the firm's online security, sparking the breach. Analysis by BAE Systems suggested there may have been up to 10 attackers.  Hanley also obtained computer files including names and passwords for server systems belonging to Nasa, after a Skype contact forwarded the details as ""a little present"". TalkTalk spotted issues with its site on 21 October 2015 and launched an investigation before warning customers the following day. This led to its then-CEO Dido Harding being subjected to blackmail attempts, with hackers demanding Bitcoin in exchange for the stolen data. Hanley admitted hacking into the website between 18 and 22 October 2015, supplying data for hacking to another man and giving Allsopp the personal and financial details of customers. Allsopp also admitted obtaining the Nasa passwords. The court heard he had boasted of having this material and erased all the content off his computer before his arrest on 30 October 2015. Allsopp admitted supplying customer details to another user for fraud as well as the necessary files for hacking. Judge Dhir said the pair were ""both involved in a significant, sophisticated systematic hack attack in a computer system used by TalkTalk"". ""The total loss to TalkTalk as a result of this overall attack is estimated to be £77 million but the loss does not end there,"" she added.

Seven years on and she is the owner of an interiors company with a turnover of £1m. Surprisingly, she partly puts her success down to the kids who bullied her throughout her time in school. ""I'm very grateful to those people as it did really motivate me to go on and do something with my life,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland's Stephen Jardine programme. ""I feel real gratitude towards these people because without them, maybe I wouldn't have the same drive as I do today."" Despite the bullying, Liv, who was last year named Young Scottish Businesswoman of the Year, achieved five A grades in her higher exams and was expected to go to university. But she chose to leave school at 16 to set up her second business. ""I could have done whatever I wanted at university but that just wasn't the path that was for me,"" she says. ""Teachers called me into the careers office, sat me down and asked if I was going crazy. They thought it was quite wild what I was doing. ""But I've always had complete belief it was going to work and fortunately it has."" Her company, The Property Stagers, has grown rapidly, from turning over £30,000 one year to £1m the next. Liv, who employs her mum Ali and brother Jack, puts the company's success down to being really active on social media and getting its name out there. ""I'd always known that I wanted to have my own business,"" she says. ""I wasn't sure what that was but I developed a love for interior design. ""My mum has always been self employed or ran her own business so I guess I just followed her. I always knew I wanted to be my own boss. ""It's great fun working with my mum. We pretty much spend every hour of the day together and fortunately we get on really well."" Liv's first business came about when the 13-year-old spotted a gap in the market. ""I bought nail foils at that age and wasn't very happy paying what I was paying for them,"" she says. ""So I thought surely I can get these cheaper, cut out the high street brands and sell them online."" Using a Far Eastern equivalent of eBay, Liv bought the foils for 37p and sold them on eBay for £8, making herself a tidy sum of about £5,000. ""I probably just spent it on buying sweets and having fun with my friends,"" she says. Liv, who is from Bothwell in South Lanarkshire, was bullied from a young age. ""It was very challenging,"" she says. ""It was pretty much my whole primary school and secondary school so it was hard and I did move schools in my final year. ""You just have to remember that school isn't forever and if you have that inner belief in yourself you shouldn't really care what anyone else thinks. ""It is really challenging at the time but once you're through it you will feel grateful to these people in your life because you've had a great life lesson. ""When someone says you can't do something it makes you want to do it even more."" Liv follows personal development/life coaches on social media and says some of them have been a ""massive inspiration"". ""I think there are so many amazing role models out there,"" she says. ""It's really important to surround yourself with people that inspire you. ""I think Scotland has amazing entrepreneurs and there are so many people that have created these businesses from nothing and went on to build empires."" Liv hopes to double her turnover this year and is looking at possibly franchising a sector of the business. ""I am also into Bitcoin investing - so that's another idea I have in the pipeline,"" she says. Liv sounds like she is the perfect candidate for The Apprentice where candidates compete to go into business with multi-millionaire Lord Sugar ""I have actually applied in the past and got through to the interview stage but something came up with the business so I couldn't go,"" she says.

The Bank of England governor said their inherent risks meant investments in digital currencies could lose money. ""The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,"" Mr Carney said in a speech on Friday. Crypto-currencies do not yet pose risks to financial stability, he said. But he said that could change if more people began investing in them. Although some countries have banned them, Mr Carney said regulation would be a better approach. ""A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system,"" he said. If the world of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin are the Wild West, a new sheriff just swaggered into town. Bank of England governor Mark Carney laid down the law today with a withering assessment of Bitcoin's qualifications to be described as money and a warning that, if allowed to grow unchecked, it could threaten financial stability. Sheriff Carney says it fails as money because it is wildly volatile, poorly understood, inefficient and not widely accepted.  Digital currencies threaten stability because people may invest substantial amounts - mistakenly believing they are regulated - causing further loss of faith in the financial system if they collapse. The evangelists of crypto-currencies will dismiss Mr Carney's assessment as the predictable response of a financial establishment that Bitcoin threatens.  If Governor Carney has his way, they will be saying: I fought the law and the law won. China has cracked down hard on crypto-currencies, banning initial coin offerings and shutting down Bitcoin exchanges. Indonesia and Bangladesh have banned Bitcoin as a payment tool, and India's central bank has issued a number of warnings about Bitcoin risks. However, Mr Carney said that the technology on which crypto-currencies are based ""could potentially catalyse innovations to serve the public better"". Blockchain technology could be used to make payments more flexible, efficient and reliable. ""They point the way to where the system has to go"" by allowing peer-to-peer transactions, he said. He said the Bank ""has an open mind"" about the eventual development of a central bank digital currency, but he said it ""shouldn't be a solution in search of a problem or an effort of central bankers to be down with the kids"". Digital currencies can allow anonymous transactions and carry risks including money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion. But in terms of regulation, ""if there's a will there's a way"", Mr Carney said. ""It's relatively straightforward.""  Crypto-currency trade body Crypto UK said it supported new regulation, but said that policymakers should not try to adapt existing financial rules to digital currencies. ""This shouldn't be viewed as a crackdown, but an opportunity to establish parameters that protect consumers while encouraging the biggest and best crypto-currency businesses to make the UK their home,"" a spokesperson said.",-0.08417391304347825,0.10488361879666228

In a statement, development studio Valve, which runs Steam, said ""high fees and volatility"" had driven it to stop accepting them. It said that fees to process Bitcoin payments had ""skyrocketed"" in 2017, making the virtual currency much less attractive as an option. It said it may re-evaluate Bitcoin as a payment possibility in the future. In its statement, Valve said although Bitcoin had always been volatile, the rapid changes in value it had seen during the past few months had been ""extreme"". Steam started accepting payments in bitcoins in April this year.  At that time, each Bitcoin was worth about $450 (£335). Now, each coin is worth about $14,800. The moment-by-moment shifts in value were a problem, Valve said, because of the narrow window customers had to complete a purchase using bitcoins.  If a Bitcoin-based transaction was prolonged, the value of the coins being transferred could change ""significantly"", it said. In these cases, customers had to transfer more bitcoins to make the payment, or get a refund. And either option would result in the customer paying more exchange fees, currently about $20.  Some customers adding bitcoins had even been caught out a second time as the value changed again. ""This year, we've seen increasing number of customers get into this state,"" Valve said. Bitcoin continued to rise in value this week and looks set to break the $15,000 barrier soon. Valve's decision comes as crypto-cash mining market NiceHash reported a ""security breach"" had meant hackers had accessed its Bitcoin wallet, which had contained about $60m in bitcoins.",0.19278125,0.0975

He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl. In an ""ask me anything"" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering. Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology. Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: ""The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. ""Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto-currencies is super risky for those who go long."" Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze ""will come to a bad end"". Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interview on Bloomberg TV, he said that Bitcoin ""was better than currency"". His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper. In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were ""reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio"". Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects. The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya. Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity. The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens. While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering.

The firm made the disclosure in its latest earnings report, where it said the activity should boost its profits. The report also confirmed that the South Korean company overtook Intel to become the biggest chipmaker last year. And it forecast strong demand for its forthcoming Galaxy S9 smartphone, which is due to be revealed on 25 February. Samsung Electronic's fourth quarter net profit totalled 12.3tn won ($11.5bn; £8.1bn), which was roughly in line with analysts' expectations. But its shares jumped nearly 9% after the company revealed that it was splitting its stock 50-to-1, which should encourage trade in the asset. For now, Samsung is providing little detail about its new crypto-currency business. ""Samsung's foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing of crypto-currency mining chips,"" it said in a statement given to the BBC. ""However we are unable to disclose further details regarding our customers."" Mining, in this context, refers to solving complex mathematical problems as a means to verify crypto-currency transactions - a task for which the owners of the computers involved are rewarded with new digital tokens or ""coins"". The Bell, a Korean-language newspaper, has reported that the processors involved are Asic (application-specific integrated circuit) chips. These are chips that are custom-designed to carry out a single task - in this case ""mining"" Bitcoin or another specific crypto-currency - but not general computing operations. Until 2013, Asic chips were more commonly associated with the TV industry. But that year, a New York-based entrepreneur began selling processors custom-designed for Bitcoin mining, which promised better performance and lower energy use than GPU (graphics processing unit) chips, which are still more commonly associated with the task. In recent months, a shortage of high-end GPU cards has pushed up their prices, making the rival Asic technology even more appealing. According to The Bell, Samsung completed development of its own Bitcoin-related Asic chip last year and began mass production earlier this month. Until now, Taiwan's TSMC was the only other major processor-manufacturer engaged in the activity. One expert said Samsung's move represented a bet that Bitcoin's rise in value does not represent a bubble that is about to burst. ""We don't know how low Samsung can sell its chip for and still be profitable,"" said Garrick Hileman, a crypto-currency researcher from the University of Cambridge. ""But if Bitcoin's price were to collapse and enter a bear market like in 2014 to 2015, one would wonder if Samsung would stay with this line of business through such a turn."" Samsung's latest venture coincided with news that its semiconductors division logged 74.3tn won ($69.6bn; £49.1bn) of sales last year. That compares with a figure of $62.8bn reported by Intel last week. It marks the first time the US firm has not occupied the top spot since 1992, according to the Bloomberg news agency. Much of Samsung's success is down to the popularity of its memory chips - it highlighted demand from the computer server and mobile device storage markets in particular. Intel is hoping to increase its own market share in the sector by offering a new proprietary memory technology called 3D Xpoint, which it began selling last year. However, it risks being distracted by the need to redesign its processor chips after a flaw with their current architecture was recently revealed.",0.254075,0.08113914442039442

The hack locked staff out of a number of council services, including payroll, planning and environmental health. The authority said it had brought in experts to better protect the authority from any future attack. Copeland, Islington and Salisbury councils were all targeted in the Bank Holiday cyber attack, in which hackers demanded a bitcoin ransom to regain access to encrypted files.

""But we are of the view that this was a sustained, resourced professional attack. This wasn't a spotty kid in a bedroom. It was an interstate attack."" She said the attack could not have been prevented because the virus used was so new at the time that it was not detected by antivirus software. Council teams now use cloud storage for key documents. The authority has also invested in more up-to-date IT equipment, introduced compulsory training and redesigned its internal networks to ensure they can be isolated in the event of a similar attack. Ms Graham added: ""There is no way we could have kept this attack out, but had we had great IT investment we probably would have recovered quicker.""

The agency's director Rob Wainwright told the BBC's Panorama that regulators and industry leaders need to work together to tackle the problem. The warning comes after Bitcoin's value fell by half from record highs in December. UK police have not commented to the programme. Mr Wainwright said that Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, estimates that about 3-4% of the £100bn in illicit proceeds in Europe are laundered through cryptocurrencies. ""It's growing quite quickly and we're quite concerned,"" he said. There many different types of cryptocurrencies but the best known is Bitcoin. They are intended to be a digital alternative to pounds, dollars or euros.  However, unlike traditional currencies, they are not printed by governments and traditional banks, nor controlled or regulated by them. Instead, digital coins are created by computers running complex mathematical equations, a process known as ""mining"". A network of computers across the world then keeps track of the transactions using virtual addresses, hiding individual identities. The anonymous and unregulated nature of virtual currencies is attracting criminals, making it hard for police to track them as it is difficult to identify who is moving payments. Mr Wainwright said: ""They're not banks and governed by a central authority so the police cannot monitor those transactions. ""And if they do identify them as criminal they have no way to freeze the assets unlike in the regular banking system."" Another problem Europol has identified involves the method that criminals use to launder money. Proceeds from criminal activity are being converted into bitcoins, split into smaller amounts and given to people who are seemingly not associated with the criminals but who are acting as ""money mules"".  These money mules then convert the bitcoins back into hard cash before returning it to the criminals. ""It's very difficult for the police in most cases to identify who is cashing this out,"" Mr Wainwright said.  He said that police were also seeing a trend where money ""in the billions"" generated from street sales of drugs across Europe is being converted into bitcoins. He called on those running the Bitcoin industries to work with enforcement agencies.  ""They have to take a responsible action and collaborate with us when we are investigating very large-scale crime,"" he said.  ""I think they also have to develop a better sense of responsibility around how they're running virtual currency.""  Although British police have yet to respond to requests from Panorama, Parliament is seeking to step up regulations.  The Treasury Select Committee is looking into cryptocurrencies and details of EU-wide regulations to force traders to disclose identities and any suspicious activity are expected later this year.  Alison McGovern, Labour MP for Wirral South who is serving on the committee, has been calling for an inquiry into cryptocurrencies. ""I think that will draw the attention of the Treasury and the Bank [of England] and others to how we put in place a regulatory system,"" she said.

270,Bithumb: Hackers 'rob crypto-exchange of $32m',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44547250,2018-06-20 10:57:53+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A leading crypto-coin exchange has halted trade after declaring that hackers had stolen some of the digital currencies it stored. Seoul-based Bithumb said that 35bn won (£24m; $31.6m) worth of cyber-cash had been ""seized"" overnight, adding that it would fully compensate affected customers. The values of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all fell on the news. It is the second time in less than a year that Bithumb has been breached. Last July, it acknowledged an employee's PC had been hacked - exposing users' personal details. South Korea's spy agency later accused North Korea of being responsible after the stolen information was used to carry out scams. Bithumb notified a local regulator - the Korea Internet and Security Agency - of the latest attack, shortly before alerting the public via social media. ""Some crypto-currencies valued [at] about $30m was stolen,"" it posted in a since deleted tweet. In subsequent posts - which are still online - it added: ""All deposit and withdrawal services will be stopped to make sure [of our] security... We are providing compensation... Bithumb urgently asks our valuable customers not to deposit any funds into Bithumb wallet addresses for the time being."" The firm provided a Google-shortened link with further information, but it appears to have been blocked by the search firm for unspecified reasons. An earlier post on Bithumb's Twitter account reveals that it had announced that a database upgrade was being carried out as part of a security update late last week. It added that it had transferred assets to a ""cold wallet"" - a term used to refer to external storage unconnected to the internet - as part of the process. However, it is unclear whether this is linked to the reported theft. The Yonhap news agency has reported that police officers have launched an investigation and collected records from computers at the company's headquarters. The incident comes just over a week after another South Korean crypto-currency exchange, Coinrail, reported that it had been the victim of a separate attack in which hackers had stolen 40bn won worth of virtual coins. Bithumb is, however, the bigger of the two operations, and represents the world's sixth busiest crypto-cash trading platform, according to the news site Coindesk. At the time of writing, one bitcoin was trading at $6,626.19 (£5,035) - representing a 1.4% drop from its level before news of the heist spread.",-0.052711111111111104,0.014027777777777781
271,CES 2019: Preparing for take-off,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46781130,2019-01-07 10:16:55+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Can you detect a low moaning sound coming from Nevada? Yes, it's that time of year again.  Technology journalists have descended on Las Vegas for CES and are complaining bitterly about the cost of hotels, the queues for taxis, and the sheer volume of silly new products - everything from an internet-of-things cat toilet to a crypto-currency-mining piggy bank. Yet for all the whingeing - and I'm an enthusiastic participant - we know that CES provides an essential guide to what's hot and what's not in technology.  If my first few hours here are anything to go by this year's show will be dominated by smart home devices, AI, autonomous and connected cars - and the question of how big a role China should be allowed to play in shaping our technology future. My very first press conference featured just about all of those themes. And Byton, the electric car-maker backed by Chinese investors with deep pockets, seemed determined to play Buzzword Bingo.  Showing off the M-Byte, a car with a touchscreen tablet embedded in the steering wheel, Byton executives told us this was going to be the most important device in our lives, it was going to use AI to transform every journey, it would leverage an ""open-ended flexible architecture"" and it would have level 3 autonomy built in. Roughly translated, this means they are building a vehicle with some nifty features that will be able to drive itself a lot of the time, while keeping its occupants informed and entertained in traffic jams. The cynic in me wonders why they could not have said that in plain English - and why they are boasting about level 3 autonomy when much of the automotive world now thinks that is a dangerous middle ground where neither the car nor the driver is in complete control. But then I marvel at a company born just a couple of years ago having the ambition - and the cash -  to believe it can deliver a world-beating electric car by the end of 2019.  This show will have more Chinese exhibitors than ever, though the trade tensions with the US will cast a shadow, and one of the biggest players Huawei seems determined to keep a low profile. With the company viewed with deep suspicion by the US, its executives were keen to promote a new notebook computer when we met them, less eager to talk about the politics of marketing a brand American consumers have been told not to trust. Next stop was CES Unveiled, a bun fight where dozens of tech companies vie to gain the attention of journalists two days before the show opens.  There were Japanese robots without any practical purpose except to serve as cuddly pets, there was a French bathroom mirror that could spot when you appeared in front of it looking rough and give you a stern talking to, there was an American mini bread factory that took flour, yeast and water and turned out finished loaves 90 minutes later. But what caught my eye was a simple piece of wood, something that at first looked as though it had wandered in from Ikea.  The Mui interactive plank is, however, connected to the internet and acts as an interface for your connected devices, allowing you to control the music and the lights or find out the weather forecast.   The idea is that it is a ""calm"" device allowing the technology to merge into the background most of the time - though a $679 (£533) price tag may receive a less-than-placid response from most householders. Our final stop was at a villa on the outskirts of Las Vegas, once apparently occupied by boxer Mike Tyson. A Rolls Royce and a yellow Lamborghini were on the drive while inside, a diverse crowd was entertained by live music and various virtual reality experiences.  This was the CoinAgenda Showcase, apparently designed to promote crypto-currencies and the blockchain.  I tried my usual trick of asking people to explain blockchain but apart from being told that it was going to change the world in various undefined ways I emerged none the wiser. One of them did, however, tell me that the Lamborghini was his, the fruits of an early investment in Bitcoin. Update 8 January 2019: Huawei has been in touch to say the company is ""not trying to avoid having the difficult conversations"". Indeed a Huawei executive based in New York will be talking to the BBC later this week about the political issues, but the representatives at CES were not qualified to talk about anything outside their product areas. But with the value of crypto-currencies plunging and blockchain projects failing so far to deliver on the hype, their promoters may struggle to make their voices heard above the hubbub of CES.",0.054624,0.07043636363636364
272,TV news 'hack' sees bitcoins snatched,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41737248,2017-10-24 15:57:01+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Two French hackers used their computer skills to reconstruct a blurred-out code on TV and claim bitcoins worth $1,000 (£760). Michel Sassano and Clement Storck had seen an interview with entrepreneur Roger Ver on French television. Mr Ver had offered $1,000 to viewers - but a QR code needed to claim the money had been blurred out. The duo analysed a small part of the code that was visible, however, and managed to access the funds.  When the France 2 channel broadcast its interview with Mr Ver earlier this month, he promised the money - just over three Bitcoin Cash coins, worth $1,000 - to whichever viewer was quickest to scan an on-screen QR code. However, the code had been blurred out by France 2 - Mr Sassano believes this is because of French broadcasting regulations that prevent news programmes from giving away prizes. ""The process to decode the private key from the moment we watched the show to when we entered it in the wallet took, I think, between 12 and 16 hours,"" Mr Sassano told the BBC.  He and Mr Storck have explained the process in detail in a blog. Their fortune depended on a moment towards the end of the TV segment when a small portion of the QR code was actually shown unblurred. The keen-eyed pair also noticed that the top of the QR code and part of the key written in letters and numbers were also not blurred sufficiently, making them readable with software. They were able to plot what they knew for sure about the code's structure - amounting to roughly a third of it - in a spreadsheet. From there, the duo worked out as much as they could about the missing portions, based on their knowledge of how QR codes are designed. Finally, they calculated that there were about 2.1 million possible final combinations. ""We got down to two valid keys that would match bitcoin private keys,"" says Mr Sassano. One of these proved to be the answer they were looking for. They transferred the money on 17 October - an online bitcoin wallet shows the transaction. ""The money is the cherry on the cake but the most exciting was when we found the private key and the algorithm told us this was the one,"" says Mr Sassano, adding that he has not yet withdrawn the money. Roger Ver described the work as ""amazing"". ""With almost no information at all they were able to reconstruct the private key and claim the funds,"" he says. ""If you have time to read the blog it's absolutely incredible."" He also reveals that he has been ""inundated"" with messages from viewers who watched the programme and wanted to know if he kept a copy of the QR code - but he had not. ""I deleted it,"" he explains. ""Now I have something to tell the French people [who contacted me] - somebody did manage to claim it.""

The group hijacked the server that hosts BlackWallet, a web-based wallet application that stores lumens and stole 669,920 from users' accounts Stellar Lumen is thought to be the eighth most popular virtual currency in the world. According to tech news site Bleeping Computer, BlackWallet tried to warn users about the attack via forums. However, many continued to log in and lose money. The hackers have moved the money to Bittrex, a virtual currency exchange, where they are likely to convert it into another digital currency to hide their tracks, Bleeping computer reported.  In a post on social website Reddit, BlackWallet's creator said he had since disabled his hosting account and websites. The developer, who goes by the alias of Orbit84, said: ""I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back.  ""I am in talks with my hosting provider to get as much information about the hacker and will see what can be done with it. ""If you ever entered your key on BlackWallet, you may want to move your funds to a new wallet."" A crypto or virtual currency is a type of money that is completely digital. You can use currencies such as Bitcoin to buy products and services, but not many shops accept them yet. In many countries they are heavily regulated.  Owners typically keep their currency in digital wallets and can transfer payments to other wallets fairly anonymously, without a bank or broker being involved. Transactions are recorded in a public list called a blockchain - a type of ledger which both records and verifies who spent or transferred which coins. The blockchain exists on computers that solve cryptographic problems as they log transactions to help combat fraud. Stellar is an open-source payments network focused on reducing poverty in the developing world. It says its lumens - which work using blockchain technology - make monetary transactions cheaper, quicker and more reliable. According to CoinMarketCap, a site that ranks the value of different crypto-currencies, there is $11.6bn worth of Stellar Lumen in circulation.  That is far less than the top virtual currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are thought to be worth $240.3bn and $127.4bn respectively.  In 2016, the price of bitcoin fell more than 10% after the Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said it had suffered a major hack. The security breach led to the possible theft of bitcoin worth $65m (£49m). And in 2017 hackers targeted the Bithumb exchange in South Korea, taking millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The personal information of 30,000 people was also stolen in the attack, which was credited to North Korea.",-0.0508,0.1321229338842975

The Belfast Telegraph states the DUP is coming under ""mounting pressure"" to accept the prime minister's deal. The paper has carried a warning from Angela McGowan, the director of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in Northern Ireland. Ahead of a meeting between business leaders and the Northern Ireland secretary, she said companies ""simply could not cope with a no-deal Brexit"". The Irish News described the trip to Belfast by Karen Bradley on Monday as an attempt to ""pitch the deal as a decisive step forward"", in which she will insist it can deliver for everyone in Northern Ireland. The newspaper quotes DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who rejected claims the party has been isolated by the business community in its opposition to the deal. ""Already we are being contacted by many business people who share our view that in the long-term this deal is not good for the economy of Northern Ireland,"" he said. In the News Letter, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the UK is facing a choice between a ""bad deal"" and the ""right deal"". ""The damning criticism expressed by the former Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, spelt out how dangerous this Withdrawal Agreement is. ""Northern Ireland will be treated as a third country for regulatory purposes, and absolutely it threatens the union... unionism stands united in opposition (to the deal),"" added the DUP North Belfast MP. Troops have been put on standby in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to the Daily Mirror. It reports the military ""may be called on to quell civil unrest, ease traffic jams at ports and fly in medicines amid shortages"". The potential intervention of the Army is described by Labour as ""an admission of failure"" of the government's Brexit preparations. Turning to matters sporting, images of Ireland's first ever win over the mighty New Zealand on Irish soil adorn the front pages of the News Letter and The Belfast Telegraph, while a County Armagh GAA club with close family links to Irish rugby captain Rory Best speak of their pride in The Irish News. Inside The Irish News, an actor and drag queen has appealed for the return of his distinctive orange wig after it was stolen outside a Belfast bar at the weekend. Matthew Cavan, also known as Cherrie On Top, has made an impassioned plea on social media for information on its' whereabouts. It was taken from a table outside The Errigle Inn on the Ormeau Road in the early hours of Sunday. There's just over a month until Christmas, and for a lot of people across Northern Ireland, that means paying someone else to cook the traditional dinner on Christmas Day. Research conducted by The Belfast Telegraph shows there is no availability at many popular hotels for Christmas Day, despite prices reaching almost £600 for a family of four. The News Letter reports that the search is on for Northern Ireland's next Police Ombudsman. Dr Michael Maguire is set to step down in July next year, and the closing date for applications to replace him is December 12. Inside the Daily Mirror, people are being advised to contact police if they receive a threatening email from scammers claiming to have evidence of porn use.

275,Hackers hijack government websites to mine crypto-cash,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43025788,2018-02-11 21:11:48+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) took down its website after a warning that hackers were taking control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency. Security researcher Scott Helme said more than 4,000 websites, including many government ones, were affected. He said the affected code had now been disabled and visitors were no longer at risk. The ICO said: ""We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it."" Mr Helme said he was alerted by a friend who had received a malware warning when he visited the ICO website. He traced the problem to a website plug-in called Browsealoud, used to help blind and partially sighted people access the web. Texthelp, the company which makes the plug-in, confirmed that the product was affected for four hours by malicious code designed to generate cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency involved was Monero - a rival to Bitcoin that is designed to make transactions in it ""untraceable"" back to the senders and recipients involved. The plug-in had been tampered with to add a program, Coinhive, which ""mines"" for Monero by running processor-intensive calculations on visitors' computers. Once the plug-in was infected, it affected thousands of other websites in addition to the ICO's, which used it. By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent The surge in value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hasn't escaped the attention of hackers looking to make a quick buck.  Mining, the process where new digital coins are created by solving complex mathematical problems, uses increasing amounts of computer processing power and that means big electricity bills.  All the better then if you can get other people's computers to do the job. The hackers do this by inserting software into websites which then means that, unbeknown to them, visitors' computers are put to work mining cryptocurrencies.  It seems that the Information Commissioner's site along with others run by the government were infected by crypto-mining code injected into some accessibility software they all use.  This kind of attack is becoming increasingly common and while it appears not to cause data loss or damage to systems, it does mean computers can run much more slowly. Mr Helme said: ""It's a very lucrative proposal. They infect one website and it infects close to 5,000. ""This was a very serious breach. They could have extracted personal data, stolen information or installed malware. It was only limited by the hackers' imaginations."" As well as the ICO website, the hacked script was found running on the site of the Student Loans Company, Barnsley Hospital and other websites in the UK and worldwide. Martin McKay, chief technical officer of TextHelp, said: ""In light of other recent cyber-attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year and our data security action plan was actioned straight away."" The company is commissioning a security review by an independent consultancy following the attack, he said. Because the malware only runs while someone is actively visiting an infected site, there is no further risk to users' computers, Mr Helme added. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said: ""NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency. ""The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely. ""At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.""",-0.09912692307692308,0.02550636863136863

Speaking at the Cannes Lions Festival on Monday, the Locked Up singer said he believed cryptocurrency could be ""the saviour of Africa"". AKoin's official website says the singer wants the app ""on every mobile phone"" between now and December. And Akon says he's also planning to build a ""crypto city"" in Senegal which he calls ""a real-life Wakanda"". Just like the fictional land of Wakanda in Marvel's Black Panther, Akon promises says his city will be a ""futuristic environment"". The website says Akon has been ""gifted"" 2,000 acres of land by the President of Senegal to build the city - which is also named after himself. Akon Crypto City will apparently be ""a short drive"" from Dakar, the capital of Senegal. He calls it ""the first 100% crypto-based city with AKoin at the centre of transactional life"". Under the ""Akoin Ecosystem"", consumers will be able to buy, hold and spend cryptocurrency straight from their smartphones. ""It brings the power back to the people and brings the security back into the currency system,"" Akon explained. ""It also allows the people to utilise it in ways where they can advance themselves and not allow government to do those things that are keeping them down."" However, Akon admitted he didn't know all the technical aspects of his new venture. ""I come with the concepts and let the geeks figure it out,"" he said. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that operates independently from a central bank. It uses cryptography (the conversion of information into an almost uncrackable code) to secure and verify transactions.  This makes it extremely difficult to counterfeit. The first and probably most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which was created by an unknown person using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Several celebrities have endorsed or invested in cryptocurrency, including Katy Perry, 50 Cent and Ashton Kutcher. AKoin is one of many projects Akon has announced in Africa.  While he was born in Missouri, Akon is of Senegalese descent and spent much of his childhood there. In 2007 he co-founded the Konfidence Foundation, a health and education charity for underprivileged children in West Africa and the United States. He also co-founded the Akon Lighting Africa project in 2014, which Akon's site says has brought solar power to 18 African countries so far. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) researchers want to expand operations at two observatories. However, they have found that key computer chips are in short supply. ""We'd like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]... and we can't get 'em,"" said Dan Werthimer. Demand for GPUs has soared recently thanks to crypto-currency mining. ""That's limiting our search for extra-terrestrials, to try to answer the question, 'Are we alone? Is there anybody out there?',"" Dr Werthimer told the BBC. ""This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months."" Mining a currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum involves connecting computers to a global network and using them to solve complex mathematical puzzles. This forms part of the process of validating transactions made by people who use the currency. As a reward for this work, the miners receive a small crypto-currency payment, making it potentially profitable. GPUs are high-performance chips and aren't just used for powering video games - they may be stacked together by Bitcoin miners, radio-astronomers or others interested in processing large amounts of data for certain applications. ""At Seti we want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can because we don't know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on and we want to look for lots of different signal types - is it AM or FM, what communication are they using?"" explained Dr Werthimer, who is chief scientist at the Berkeley Seti Research Center. ""That takes a lot of computing power."" He added that, at some telescopes, Berkeley Seti has around 100 GPUs crunching data from large listening arrays. These arrays can pick up the faintest of radio frequencies that have been flung across our solar system from elsewhere in the universe - often from natural phenomena such as collapsing stars. The Seti scientists are currently trying to improve their capacity for analysing such data at two observatories - Green Bank in West Virginia and Parkes in Australia. But they have been hit by the GPU shortage. ""We've got the money, we've contacted the vendors, and they say, 'We just don't have them',"" said Dr Werthimer. Earlier this year, there were reports that video gamers had been hit by a sudden rise in the cost of GPUs, thanks in particular to a rise in Ethereum mining, which can be done with chips aimed at consumers. At the time, major chip-maker Nvidia said that retailers should make arrangements to make sure gamers' demands were met. In a conference call last week, Nvidia's chief executive told investors the company was ""working really hard"" to ""catch up with supply"" and get GPUs to the marketplace. Other radio-astronomers have been affected. A group looking for evidence of the earliest stars in the universe was recently shocked to see that the cost of the GPUs it wanted had doubled. ""We're in the process of expanding our telescope - we got a grant from the National Science Foundation here in the United States to do so,"" said Aaron Parsons at the University of California at Berkeley. Prof Parsons' radio telescope, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (Hera), is an American, British and South African project located in South Africa's western plains. It has been designed to listen to low frequency radio waves emitted by the reionising hydrogen gas that permeated the universe before the first stars and galaxies formed. GPUs are needed in order to bring together data from Hera's many small radio telescopes - this synthesises a much larger array, offering an especially wide field of view peering out into the universe. Three months ago, the Hera team had budgeted for a set of GPUs that cost around $500 (£360) - the price has since doubled to $1,000. ""We'll be able to weather it but it is coming out of our contingency budget."" added Prof Parsons. ""We're buying a lot of these things, it's going to end up costing about $32,000 extra."" He also said he was concerned that future work could even be stopped in its tracks, should the GPU shortage worsen. Thanks in part to a recent boom in the price of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, mining crypto-currencies has never been more popular. While Bitcoin miners have largely moved on to specialised ""Asic"" chips that have been designed from scratch to support mining, it's still possible to use GPUs on the Ethereum mining network to lucrative ends, according to cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House. ""[You can] use GPUs effectively to turn a small profit, you're not going to make millions but if you put 12 or 24 GPUs together, you'll make back the cost in six months,"" he told the BBC. GPUs are versatile, he added, pointing out that cyber-security experts sometimes use them for password-cracking experiments, in which computers make many millions of attempts at breaking into a system. But Mr Hickey has also noticed that GPUs are now being sold on sites such as Ebay at inflated prices. ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to find suppliers and cards,"" he said.",0.08091142857142856,0.06496645021645021
280,Tech 2017: BBC News Online's biggest technology stories,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41849590,2017-12-28 06:52:25+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"For many, 2017 will be defined by fake news and the fight-back against it.  Others will point to the blog that uncovered sexism and sexual harassment at Uber, helping force the resignation of the ride-hailing firm's founder and paving the way for other controversies to be uncovered. Gamers may prefer instead to celebrate Nintendo's revival thanks to its Switch console, and motorists to highlight Elon Musk's desire to electrify the trucking industry. But you, BBC Tech's readers, focused your attention elsewhere - at least as far as our figures on what you clicked on suggest. Below are the stories you made most popular for each month of the year. January: Undesired dimension The quiet death of 3D TV was the first of the year's big stories.  When Sony and LG unveiled their new television ranges at the CES Las Vegas tech expo, it soon became apparent none of the models supported the format.  Samsung and Philips had already ditched the technology the previous year.  Strictly speaking, 3D-on-the-home-screen wasn't totally extinct - Panasonic came out with a new set in February - but a combination of consumer apathy,  frumpy glasses and uninterested streaming services had clearly doomed the extra dimension.  With CES 2018 just around the corner, the question is whether we'll soon be able to call time on curved screens too. February: Nokia's retro relaunch HMD Global pulled off a marketing coup when it unveiled a new Nokia-branded 2G phone with the same name as one of the most iconic models of yesteryear.  The ""reimagined"" 3310 featured the classic game Snake, offered extended battery life and kind of resembled the original design. But it lacked access to Snapchat, WhatsApp and countless other apps.  Moreover, once owners got over the nostalgia factor, they discovered the photos it took were both pixelated and hard to get off the device.  Even so, there was enough demand to justify a follow-up 3G model in September, and the phones appear to have helped raise the profile of other higher-end Nokia handsets. March: Watching the watchers Allegations that the CIA and MI5 had teamed up to hack Samsung TVs were made even juicier by the fact the project had apparently been given a Doctor Who-related codename.  According to Wikileaks, the Weeping Angel attack caused compromised TVs to record audio when apparently switched off, before later uploading it to the cyberspies' computer servers.  Effectively, it allowed a room to be bugged without producing giveaway radio signals.  One theory for the project's name was that just like the malevolent sci-fi statues, the TVs were still ""alive"" even when they appeared to be inactive.  Later in the year, Wikileaks published further details, including how the spyware could be uninstalled, as well as claims about other CIA-related hacking tools. April: Facebook and Google get scammed Although $100m (£76m) might seem like pocket change to Google and Facebook, the two companies missed the funds after they - and a third business, Quanta Computer - were allegedly conned by an email fraudster.  The accused is said to have faked messages from an Asian-based manufacturer and convinced his victims to wire payments to his account over a three-year period.  The Lithuanian suspect, Evaldas Rimasauskas, was extradited from his home country to New York later in the year where he now faces charges for wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft.  He denies the allegations. May: WannaCry wreaks havoc A common refrain with cyber-security alerts is that, despite there being a hullabaloo of expert opinions, there's typically little real impact to the public. WannaCry was the exception.  The ransomware attack swept across the world locking out users from tens of thousands of Windows PCs. The assault - later blamed on North Korea - forced NHS trusts in England and Scotland to cancel operations and other appointments.  It was subsequently revealed that they had ignored earlier government warnings to update their systems, which could have mitigated the problem.  The one upside was that a British cyber-security researcher, Marcus Hutchins, managed to trigger a ""kill switch"", halting the attack prematurely. More on him in a bit... June: Ukraine attack Just a month after WannaCry, another hack attack caused chaos - and this time the damage proved to be longer-lasting. An infected tax software update sent to businesses in Ukraine spread worldwide, disrupting the operations of some of the world's biggest companies.  They included shipping firm Maersk, delivery giant FedEx, advertising conglomerate WPP and the consumer goods-maker Reckitt Benckiser. In some cases it took months before operations returned to normal, and related losses totalling more than $1bn were declared.  Ukraine accused Russia of being responsible, but the Kremlin denied involvement.  A complicating factor in reporting the cyber-strike was that the security industry struggled to settle on a name for it - with Petya, NotPetya, Pneytna, Petrwrap, SortaPetya and Goldeneye among the variants suggested. July: Bitcoin's big moment Bitcoin's future seemed in doubt when there were rival plans mid-year to tackle a slowdown in the amount of time taken to process transactions in the virtual currency.  Without delving too deeply into the proposals - you can read up on Bip 91, Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit2x if you dare - a compromise deal was eventually struck to make the underlying technology, the blockchain, more efficient.  But the plan fell apart before it had a chance to be fully enacted in November. That failure didn't prevent Bitcoin's value from bubbling higher. When the article in question was published, it was worth about $2,400 per coin.  By December, it was close to $20,000.  Slow processing times, however, remain a headache. Earlier this month, the average time taken to confirm a Bitcoin transaction was close to 24 hours. August: From hero to hounded Marcus Hutchins never wanted to be exposed as the ""Wannacry hack hero"" and his name only became public after British newspapers revealed him to be cyber-security blogger Malware Tech against his will.  That act carried a vicious sting in its tail when the 23 year old was arrested by the FBI after a trip to Las Vegas. The US accused him of having developed banking malware several years ago and of selling it on dark web forums - charges Mr Hutchins denies.  The accusations caused fury among other cyber-security professionals, with some vowing to restrict the support they offered the authorities.  Mr Hutchins is currently released on bail in Los Angeles where he is awaiting trial.  In the meantime, the Trump administration recently acknowledged that it was ""lucky"" Mr Hutchins had thwarted Wannacry, although it avoided mentioning him by name. September: iPhone X exposed Curiously, a major leak about Apple's iPhone X ahead of its official launch managed to attract more eyeballs to BBC Tech than the actual unveiling of the device itself.  Details included the phone's name, the set-up process for its facial recognition technology and the inclusion of its animated emoji characters.  An extra element of schadenfreude was provided for company critics by the fact that an earlier leak had disclosed that Apple had hired ex-FBI and NSA workers to thwart such spoilers.  It's questionable whether the reveal actually dampened demand for the £1,000 handset.  The US firm has forecast record sales for its current quarter. However, in recent days some analysts have begun to question how robust demand will be later in 2018. October: Amazon thieves busted When a company gets to be Amazon's size it has to rely on automated systems to deal with items reported as damaged or missing by their intended recipients.  A US couple thought that presented them with an opportunity. They used hundreds of fake identities to order gadgets from the online retailer,  reported problems that triggered replacement deliveries, and then sold on all the goods for a profit.  The $1.2m scale of their crime, however, meant their activity had in fact been detected and they eventually pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering after being arrested.  Erin Joseph Finan and his wife Leah Jeannette Finan were supposed to have been sentenced in November.  But that has been delayed after they were accused of defrauding another internet retailer in the months after the original charges were filed. November: Rough start ""The future is here,"" Navya's self-driving shuttle bus had emblazoned on its side as it launched its Las Vegas pick-up service.  Unfortunately, less than an hour later, that future involved a delivery lorry backing into its front. As one passenger later recounted, the ""crash"" seemed to occur in slow-motion and only caused superficial damage. But the story sped across the world.  Although the human driver was ultimately held responsible, the police report - made public earlier this month - told a more nuanced story.  The trucker said they had turned on their hazard lights and sounded a back-up alarm to warn surrounding motorists that they were straightening up the cab.  It had never occurred to them that an automated vehicle would respond by remaining stationary in their path without doing more to prevent the accident.  December: Slowing down Apple may have had the best of intentions, but its love of secrecy left even some of its biggest fans shaking their heads this time round.  It was only after a blog by the makers of the Geekbench app went viral that the US firm publicly confirmed it had been deliberately slowing down ageing iPhones to help manage performance issues caused by their batteries wearing out.  It subsequently emerged that the firm had apparently privately briefed some analysts on the decision a year ago, but had not shared the details with its consumers.  Whether those customers would really have preferred thicker handsets with bigger or swappable batteries is open to debate.  But the risk it faces is that shoppers suspect it is untrustworthy.  At time of writing, Apple is being sued in eight separate cases in the US over the matter, as well as facing legal action in Israel.",-0.17163289473684215,0.02247649189261031
281,PGA Championship servers hacked and files locked,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45128685,2018-08-09 14:25:32+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Hackers have broken into servers belonging to PGA of America, which runs the PGA Championship golf tournament. Files containing marketing materials for that competition as well as the Ryder Cup in France have been locked, pending payment of a ransom. A Bitcoin address was provided, but the hackers did not specify a desired amount, according to sports magazine Golfweek. A PGA spokesman told BBC News he had no comment as the incident was ongoing. He did add, however, that the PGA Championship would not be affected. The encrypted files included promotional banners and logos used online and in print, as well as logos that may be used for future tournaments. Golfweek reported that the hackers sent an email address and offered to decrypt two files to prove they could unlock them. ""We exclusively have decryption software for your situation,"" they are alleged to have written.  ""No decryption software is available in the public."" The hackers also warned that any attempts to crack the encryption could cause the loss of the data in question. Software that locks data and demands that a ransom be paid to grant access again, is known as ransomware. It has become an increasingly common way of trying to extort people and businesses - but most cyber-security experts advise against paying the ransom. This is because it may encourage such criminal activity and there is never any guarantee that the hackers will indeed unlock the files once payment has been received. Because the incident occurred right before the start of PGA Championship, it's likely the hackers were trying to maximise the effect of their attack, said cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House. ""They would have picked a date to cause as much disruption as possible,"" he told the BBC.",-0.03775,-0.011224489795918368

The document quotes Marcus Hutchins as saying that he wrote code for an unidentified third-party, who then used it to make bank-hacking software. Mr Hutchins has been accused of creating and distributing the password-stealing malware Kronos. He has denied the charges. The Ilfracombe, Devon-based researcher rose to prominence a year ago when he halted the Wannacry ransomware attack that had caused havoc within the NHS as well as locking users out of other computers across the world. However, Mr Hutchins was arrested three months later by the FBI after attending cyber-security conferences in Las Vegas, at which he had been lauded. On Tuesday, prosecutors filed the call transcript along with a two-hour FBI interview, a day ahead of the latest hearing into the case. Mr Hutchins's lawyers are now seeking to have the evidence ruled inadmissible. They say he had been ""sleep-deprived and intoxicated"" at the time and had been ""coerced"" into a confession. ""So, I wrote code for a guy a while back who then incorporated it into a banking malware,"" Mr Hutchins is quoted as saying during the phone call after his arrest. ""So, they have logs of that, and essentially they want to know my part of the banking operation or if I just sold the code on to some guy. ""Once they found I sold the code to someone, they wanted me to give them his name, and I don't actually know anything about him."" Mr Hutchins is also quoted as discussing paying off a £5,000 debt by passing on ""compiled binary"" of the code. The debt is explained by the loss of some Bitcoin digital currency that he had been looking after for someone else. ""I think the coding part I was less than 18, but I think giving him the binary I might have been older than 18,"" Mr Hutchins is said to have added. ""I knew it was always going to come back, I just didn't think it would be so soon.""",-0.1885266666666667,0.04958333333333333

The PSNI received 24 reports of scams and attempts to con people into making bogus payments over a two-day period this week. The reports, from people across counties Armagh, Down and Antrim, were made on Monday and Tuesday. Those targeted received automated messages from people claiming to work for HMRC and internet providers. Despite attempts, police said that none of the potential victims had lost any money.  Ch Supt Simon Walls told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme about the different techniques scammers had used to try to trick people into making payments. ""Some callers said they received emails and calls demanding they pay a certain sum of money using Bitcoin or else they'd post videos online of them watching footage of a sexual nature,"" he said.  ""In another instance, a man received a call from someone claiming to represent BT, who said their internet had been hacked and requested access to their account. ""Thankfully in this case, the scam was spotted and no money was lost"".

""Our advice is always be wary of any individual who cold calls you. Don't allow any cold caller remote access to your computer,"" he said.   ""Be especially suspicious of anyone who asks for personal details, banking or credit information. ""Guarding your personal banking details is essential.

The head of the International Monetary Fund says governments around the world could harness the technology to stop illegal activity. The anonymity of currencies such as Bitcoin means they are used by criminals and terrorists, she said. But the technology could be turned against such nefarious activities. Regulators around the world have called for greater crypto-currency oversight. Although the technology underlying digital assets has been praised as a way to speed up financial transactions and reduce costs, the anonymity behind crypto-currency trading is a big worry, Ms Lagarde said in a blog post.. What makes the technology so appealing is also what makes it ""dangerous,"" she said, as it can be used as a ""major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism"". But she said the technologies behind crypto-currencies can be harnessed to mitigate this ""peril"". ""The same innovations that power crypto-assets can also help us regulate them,"" she said ""To put it another way, we can fight fire with fire. Regulatory technology and supervisory technology can help shut criminals out of the crypto world."" Distributed ledger technology (DLT) - the technology underlying crypto-currencies - is defined by the UK government as ""an asset database that can be shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions"". Ms Lagarde said that DLT technology ""can be used to speed up information-sharing between market participants and regulators"". She added: ""The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures."" In addition, other technologies such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, and cryptography ""can enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions in close to real time,"" she said. Regulators need to use the same rules ""to protect consumers in both digital and non-digital transactions"", she added. Industry body Crypto UK said regulatory certainty was ""essential to attracting the best of this sector to call the UK home."" But a spokesperson said that regulators should not ""simply retrofit non-digital rules to this unique and evolving sector"". ""Working with industry to develop a tailored framework is crucial to capturing the true value of this technology, whilst weeding out illegal activity,"" the spokesperson added. Crypto-currencies have come under increasing regulatory scrutiny around the world. At the beginning of March, Bank of England governor Mark Carney called for increased regulation after crypto-currency ""mania"".

285,Marshall Islands warned against adopting digital currency,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45485685,2018-09-11 16:10:02+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands has been warned against adopting a digital currency as a second form of legal tender. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the country, which consists of hundreds of islands in the Pacific Ocean, should ""seriously reconsider"". Currently, only the US dollar counts as legal tender in the islands. A law to adopt a digital currency named ""Sovereign"" alongside the dollar was passed in February. The first virtual coins are due to be issued to members of the public via an initial coin offering (ICO) later this year. However, IMF directors said the potential benefits of the move were much smaller than the potential costs of ""economic, reputational and governance risks"". ""[Marshall Island] authorities should seriously reconsider the issuance of the digital currency as legal tender,"" wrote the directors in their report, which was first spotted by cryptocurrency news site Coindesk. There is just one domestic commercial bank in the country and it is at risk of losing its only correspondent banking relationship with another bank in the US. That relationship allows the Islands to transfer dollars in and out of the country. It highlighted the Marshall Islands' dependence on foreign aid, and the fact that the country is vulnerable to natural disasters as well as sea level rise linked to climate change.  Adopting a digital currency as an official form of legal tender would threaten both financial integrity and the nation's key relationship with the US bank. The result could be disruption to foreign aid, according to the IMF. The global financial organisation was expressing concern because it was aware of traditional banks' wariness around digital currencies, said David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 foot Blockchain. Those banks may, for example, associate crypto or digital currencies with criminal activity, including money-laundering, because the digital currency networks have been designed to move coins or tokens around at great speed. ""You just can't control the stuff,"" Mr Gerard told the BBC. ""Tokens are really, really liquid, that's the whole point."" This could give the US correspondent bank cause to rethink its relationship with the Marshall Islands, he explained. ""The IMF is not strong-arming the Marshalls, what they're doing is describing what will obviously happen if they proceed - the large correspondent bank will be quite worried,"" he added.",-0.07522941176470589,0.018312324929971993

No, it's not barcodes, augmented reality glasses or solar-powered drones, but that favourite of every consultant and futurist worth their salt, the blockchain.   And this time it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer who's apparently decided that if a distributed database can solve everything from global warming to age verification, then delivering frictionless trade should be a piece of cake. ""There is technology becoming available,"" said Philip Hammond when asked about solutions to the border problem at the Conservative Party conference.""I don't claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious technology is blockchain."" Now, Mr Hammond shouldn't be embarrassed about his lack of expertise - I've spoken to countless blockchain entrepreneurs and consultants who have failed to give convincing explanations of what the technology does and why it is going to prove so revolutionary. But just how he thinks a decentralised and immutable database will smooth the path of goods across the border is unclear. After all, the only large-scale deployment of blockchain to date has been in providing the infrastructure for Bitcoin, where, in the words of the economist Nouriel Roubini, it has processed transactions like a ""slow energy-inefficient dinosaur"". I called the Treasury to try to understand why blockchain might be the answer. All I got on the record was this: ""We are actively considering technologies that could help facilitate trade over the Northern Ireland - Ireland land border, in order to streamline any requirements that may emerge for traders after the UK leaves the EU. These technological solutions will support our commitment to no physical infrastructure at the land border."" The impression I came away with was that blockchain was just one of a number of technologies they've been looking at but they have no idea yet when or whether it might provide a practical solution. But one can sympathise with civil servants doubtless under siege from London's teeming army of blockchain hucksters. In recent weeks I've been contacted by excitable PR people telling me how, with the help of their clients,  government departments from HM Revenue and Customs to Land Registry are embracing blockchain in a big way. Once I have got in touch with those departments, I've been met with weary sighs and suggestions that Whitehall's enthusiasm for blockchain has been somewhat exaggerated.  The irony is that many of the most enthusiastic blockchain evangelists are libertarians who believe it will eventually bring about the demise first of central banks then of government itself.   But for now it is the new, new thing, bigger than the internet - so don't be surprised if more politicians climb on the blockchain bandwagon.",0.2113857142857143,0.04850494743351886

Salon told readers: ""We intend to use a small percentage of your spare processing power to contribute to the advancement of technological discovery, evolution and innovation."" The site is making use of CoinHive, a controversial mining tool that was recently used in an attack involving government websites in the UK, US and elsewhere.  However, unlike that incident, where hackers took control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency, Salon notifies users and requires them to agree before the tool begins mining. ""I've opted-in to Salon's new revenue model using Coinhive,"" wrote security researcher Troy Mursch. ""100% of my CPU [central processing unit]  is now used by them to mine cryptocurrency.

Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming.

290,Ripple becomes second most valuable crypto-coin,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42541390,2018-01-02 12:14:44+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"A crypto-currency called Ripple has become the second most valuable virtual cash system. Over the weekend the value of the digital currency hit more than $100bn (£74bn) according to some market monitors. This valuation is higher than the other popular crypto-cash system - Ethereum. Each Ripple coin, called an XRP, is now worth about $2.34 - far higher than the half a US cent they were worth a year ago. Bitcoin still remains the most valuable crypto-currency. The value of the 16.8 million bitcoins in circulation is now worth a nominal $231bn. Each bitcoin has a value of about $13,580. Ripple has sought to establish itself as a safe alternative to other crypto-currencies by emphasising its links to existing financial institutions. Ripple was set up to help banks speed up and modernise how they pay each other. So far, about 100 banks have signed up to use its payments system. Bank of America and UBS are among its customers. ""Forget Bitcoin, that's old hat -  it's time to get into Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple."" So goes the message from the crypto-currency enthusiasts when critics mention Bitcoin's failings as a currency and its profligate use of energy in the mining process.  They also like to use a dubious measure -  market capitalisation - to show just how significant a force a crypto-currency like Ripple, or rather its crypto-currency XRP, has become.  When investors talk of the ""market cap"" of a company such as Apple - about $870bn right now - they reach the figure by multiplying the number of shares by their price to calculate the value of the business.  That price can move around pretty sharply but you will have little trouble selling your shares and turning them into hard cash.  Ripple's market cap has been calculated by multiplying the number of XRP coins in existence by the current dollar exchange rate.  But unlike Apple, Ripple has no reliable assets or revenue streams backing up that rate, and changing it into ""fiat currency"" - that dreary old concept that is supposedly heading for extinction -  may prove tricky if everyone heads for the exit at once.   So as with everything connected with crypto-currencies it's best to take their market caps with a sackload of salt. Growing adoption of Ripple seems to have driven its rise in value.  Over the weekend, three of Japan's big credit card companies revealed they had signed up to use it to handle payments and settlement.  Prior to this announcement, some South Korean and Japanese banks announced a pilot project that would use Ripple to handle cross-border payments. Both events are believed to have prompted the bump in value.  Unlike other crypto-currencies, Ripple coins or tokens are not mined by the members of the network that processes transactions. Instead, the coins have been pre-mined and are slowly being released as the network is used. Eddy Travia, head of crypto-cash financier Coinsilium, told the Financial Times that the higher value could be a problem for Ripple which had done well to win banks over to its technology. ""The worry is that when the price goes up so much it moves the focus from the technology to just the speculation,"" he told the paper.",0.23923461538461538,0.13578296703296705
291,WannaCry ransomware bitcoins move from online wallets,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40811972,2017-08-03 09:17:20+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"More than $140,000 (£105,000) worth of bitcoins paid by victims of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak have been removed from their online wallets. It has been nearly three months since infections struck organisations worldwide, including the NHS, which faced days of disruption as a result. The bitcoin activity was noticed by a Twitter bot set up by Quartz journalist Keith Collins. The balance of all wallets known to be associated with WannaCry is now zero. The ransomware hit many businesses hard, quickly infecting multiple computers on corporate networks and encrypting them so they became useless. Victims were asked to pay between $300 and $600 to get their systems back. Back in May, many cyber-security experts and law enforcement agencies advised victims that paying the ransom would probably only encourage other cyber-criminals and not result in restored access to computers. However, many clearly decided to take a chance. According to bitcoin-monitoring company Elliptic, an initial portion of the WannaCry funds were moved in late July. And at about 04:10 BST on Thursday, the vast majority were finally withdrawn in entirety. Many watchers expect that the WannaCry bitcoins will be put through a ""mixer"" - in which the currency is transferred and mixed into a larger series of payments that make it much harder to track where it ends up. But the incident has left some cyber-security experts confused. ""I have no idea why they would move that money to be honest,"" said Andy Patel at F-Secure. ""I wouldn't imagine that they are going to try and turn those bitcoins into real money. If they do, it's going to give someone a way to track them to an actual person."" Instead, Mr Patel told the BBC the funds could be used to pay for dark web services that might leave less of a digital paper trail. In July, bitcoins paid as ransom following a separate attack - NotPetya - were moved from their online wallets. Many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous: the online equivalent of cash. However, every transaction is completely visible to anyone who cares to look.   There are even online sites that allow you to view what is happening in the blockchain - the distributed ledger that records all bitcoin movements. The blockchain is more like a Swiss bank account: you know the account number and which account transfers money to which other accounts, but you don't necessarily know who stands behind that account number.  A technique called ""cluster analysis"" looks across all of these bitcoin addresses and attempts to find addresses that are being used by the same people.  Then, some of the other transactions in that cluster, which were not intended to be anonymous, can provide evidence of who owns those addresses. Law enforcement agencies often use this classic approach to track criminals - the idea, of course, is: ""Follow the money."" Alan Woodward is professor of cyber-security at the University of Surrey.

292,Google bans crypto-currency adverts,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43398410,2018-03-14 08:33:32+00:00,"['bitcoin', '', '']",bbc,"Google has moved to ban crypto-currency advertising from its platforms. The move will affect promotional campaigns for initial coin offerings, Bitcoin exchanges, digital wallets to store the assets and trading advice. A notice said the policy would be introduced in June but did not give an explanation why. The BBC understands that Google decided to act because it felt there was a lack of appropriate consumer protections for highly speculative and complex trades. It follows a similar move by Facebook in January, which said many firms in the sector were acting in bad faith. Google's decision will affect ads displayed both in its search results and YouTube, as well as those placed on third-party sites via its ad platforms. The value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all dipped after the news emerged at about 04:00 GMT. Ahead of the announcement, some users of Google's AdWords service had reported a drop-off in the performance of their crypto-currency campaigns, although the tech giant denied having made any policy changes at that point. Google has also said it will tighten its rules for ads relating to other financial products including spread betting and contracts-for-difference - in which sellers promise to provide compensation for an asset's gain in value over a set period of time, and buyers to cover a loss.  It said AdWords users would have to be licensed by the  relevant regulators in the countries they are targeting and be certified by Google itself. ""This is all a good move,"" commented crypto-currency sceptic David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain. ""It's about tackling the kinds of risky investments that verge on gambling.  ""If you're a proper trader or an accredited investor then fine - it means you're rich and your money is your own problem. But these things shouldn't be targeted at ordinary people."" Google's move followed a warning about crypto-currencies published by the International Monetary Fund's managing director on Tuesday. ""Money laundering and terrorist financing is only one dimension of the threat,"" wrote Christine Lagarde. ""The rapid growth of crypto-assets, the extreme volatility in their traded prices, and their ill-defined connections to the traditional financial world could easily create new vulnerabilities. ""We must welcome their potential but also recognise their risks.""",-0.002694117647058824,0.10702094474153298
