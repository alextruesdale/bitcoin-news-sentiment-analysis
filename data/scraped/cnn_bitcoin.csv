0,0,Bitcoin could change the game for foreign aid,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/perspectives/bitcoin-foreign-aid/index.html,"May 23, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Alex Gladstein is the chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation and a guest lecturer at Singularity University. He owns a small amount of bitcoin. LocalBitcoins is participating at HRF's upcoming Oslo Freedom Forum conference. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  Today's humanitarian aid model is fundamentally broken. Whether you're a foundation making a donation to a nonprofit abroad, a government distributing aid to another government, or an individual sending emergency funds to family members across borders, your money only gets to where it needs to go after passing through intermediaries. Even in the simplest payment scenario, there's your bank; a coordination network; and the aid recipient's bank. But often, there are even more middlemen, with money moving along complex chains of third parties. Such a system has obvious flaws. One is that each intermediary between you and the person or organization you are trying to help can delay, surveil, censor or steal your funds. In 2012, the UN's then-secretary general Ban Ki-moon said that ""corruption prevented 30% of all development assistance from reaching its final destination.""  Corruption aside, aid is at risk of getting eaten up along the way by overhead and administrative costs. In a research study done by Oxfam, only 7% of $28 million in US aid meant for Ghana provably made it into that country between 2013 and 2015 due to a lack of available data. Even if all goes well, it can take several days, weeks or even months for the recipient to finally receive the aid. And in a world where 1.7 billion people don't have a bank account, many can't even ultimately claim your donation. The way aid moves today is corruptible, inefficient and slow. Research from organizations like the World Bank and the charity organization GiveDirectly suggests that distributing aid via direct cash transfers can be extremely effective. But how can we truly innovate in this area if there are so many intermediaries, even for small payments? Here's where Bitcoin changes the equation. With Bitcoin, you can send money directly to anyone in the world in a matter of minutes. As your funds move to the recipient, it's not possible for third parties to censor or steal, as payment processing is done through a global competition, not by a centralized institution. To receive Bitcoin, you just need a smartphone with Bitcoin wallet software. According to the latest Pew data, 45% of citizens in emerging economies already own a smartphone today. While that means a large number of people in the world's poorest countries don't have the internet in their pocket yet, the fact that nearly half do is significant and this number will only continue to rise in the coming years. To receive Bitcoin, they don't need a passport or an ID or a bank account, and they don't have to ask permission from a government or a company to accept the funds. It is a true peer-to-peer transaction, done over a global, neutral payment rail. Of course, what isn't guaranteed is that the recipient can turn Bitcoin into local currency so they can buy the food, medicine or help that they need. That's a major challenge, but it's changing in a big way. According to a global analysis of Bitcoin exchange data, individuals in West Africa, Latin America and East Asia are seeing a significant increase in their ability to sell Bitcoin for local currency. In an interview with researchers at the Open Money Initiative, I learned that the ""liquidity time"" of Bitcoin in Venezuela today is 15 minutes. Meaning, if you're in Caracas, I can send you Bitcoin from Miami and you can be holding bolivares in your hand within 15 minutes of my Bitcoin arriving on your phone. To give you an idea of the scale of Bitcoin activity in Venezuela today, consider that on April 26, 639 million bolivares were traded on the Caracas Stock Exchange. During that same week, the average daily volume of Bitcoin traded on one online platform alone — LocalBitcoins — was 5.2 billion bolivares. LocalBitcoins is one of several online marketplaces — like Paxful, Hodl Hodl and Bisq — that work a bit like eBay. For example, if you're in New York and I'm in Lagos and you send me 1 bitcoin (roughly $7,800 at today's price), I'd create an account on the LocalBitcoins website and make a post, saying I'm selling 1 bitcoin for the going rate of around 2.8 million Nigerian naira. When I get a good offer, I click accept. I send my Bitcoin to LocalBitcoins, you send your naira to me, and my Bitcoin is only released to you when I confirm that I've received your naira. Or, we can choose to meet and make the trade in person, where you give me cash and I send you Bitcoin, smartphone-to-smartphone. And — voila — I just received Bitcoin from across the world and turned it into local, spendable currency. When the highway blockade occurred on the Colombian border, preventing much-needed aid from getting into Venezuela, millions of dollars of Bitcoin were freely moving in and out. A big perk of using Bitcoin is that even when brick-and-mortar banks close, the Bitcoin network never shuts down. As global Bitcoin infrastructure improves and local exchange becomes more widely available, its value proposition for humanitarian aid �� especially in disaster zones and tough political climates — will only increase. If you are one of the billions of people stuck in a country restricted by capital controls, suffering from hyperinflation, trapped behind sanctions or simply lacking identification or a bank account, donors can now use Bitcoin to reach you directly. If you are a gift-giving foundation, foreign ministry or development advisor, could sending your aid via Bitcoin be a better way? Bitcoin's peer-to-peer digital payments network could be the future of humanitarian aid.  "
1,1,"Bitcoin hit $8,000 again. What's behind the rise",http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/investing/bitcoin-8000-comeback-investing/index.html,"May 14, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Bitcoin just surged past $8,000 on Tuesday, hitting its highest mark since last July. It tapered off slightly by mid-afternoon, but is still trading at its highest level in nearly a year. What's going on? Bullish experts say the strong showing could signal that bitcoin has a future as a worthy investment opportunity. But the currency's volatile and controversial history has prompted plenty of skepticism.  Bitcoin has typically been regarded as risky, said Dan Held, co-founder of Interchange, a company that advises businesses on how to manage their crypto assets. But he said the currency's resurgence might be the first inkling that it holds weight as a ""risk off"" trade — an investment treated as a safer bet when markets are tumultuous, like bonds or gold. After all, the currency skyrocketed in value Monday when the Dow plunged 617 points, perhaps suggesting that investors turned to bitcoin as a safe haven asset.  ""It's bitcoin's moment to shine when people momentarily give up on the government or the banking system,"" Held added. But the bitcoin rally didn't end when the markets were plunging. The currency continued to climb early Tuesday even as the major indexes did well, and it held steady for much of the day. That could have been because Monday's bitcoin trading frenzy spurred additional investor interest, said James Putra, head of product strategy at brokerage firm TradeStation Crypto. ""When the market started to rise, it drew more people in,"" Putra said. ""Larger players started to take bites out of the marketplace; it's a common and familiar approach."" Still, bitcoin has been here before. It hit $20,000 in December 2017 before crashing the next year. Some experts called the downturn a correction after a period of ""speculative mania.""  The currency also faced accusations of price manipulation: Two academics at the University of Texas at Austin studied the possibility bitcoin had been manipulated and said they found evidence that it had been during its massive 2017 run-up. The shadow of price manipulation continues to loom over bitcoin. ""Manipulation could very well be behind the recent market moves. To act like bitcoin and crypto currency prices are purely driven by supply and demand of little traders ... ignores the specific mechanics of this marketplace,"" said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin and one half of the duo that penned the paper on price manipulation last year.  ""It would not be a stretch nor surprising to find that manipulative activity is behind the recent runup when the underlying market mechanics are similar to before,"" Griffin added. Griffin isn't the only one with that suspicion. ""I don't think anyone really knows what this is due to,"" said Tim Massad, former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speaking about the latest rally. ""But you worry that manipulation could be a contributing factor given the lack of regulation and transparency in this market compared to other markets."" Massad said he lauded the Securities and Exchange Commission for stepping up oversight of cryptocurrency, but added that ""you still have gaps in regulation.""  Another, simpler explanation for the price rise: It's Blockchain Week, an unofficial holiday for bitcoin. The event, which is also called Consensus 2019, draws in more buyers for bitcoin and other major currencies, according to Lennon Sweeting, the director and head trader of Coinsquare, a Canadian cryptocurrency trading platform. There's also the fact that bitcoin and blockchain — the underlying technology that acts as a public ledger — have steadily become more mainstream. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the nation's largest bank, announced a new digital coin earlier this year. JPMorgan and Microsoft (MSFT) recently announced plans to partner and expand on blockchain platforms. And ICE (ICE), the owner of the NYSE, launched a futures exchange for bitcoin and other cryptos.  All of that could make the digital currency and its technology appear more credible to investors. And it gives bitcoin's backers a reason to remain optimistic.  ""The $10,000 mark remains firmly in sight over the coming months,"" said Vaibhav Kadikar, founder and CEO of a decentralized prediction market platform, CloseCross. ""And the possibility of surpassing the previous high in the coming half year still remains."" -- CNN Business' Anneken Tappe and Paul La Monica contributed to this report."
3,3,Nvidia stock jumps after first quarter earnings beat expectations,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/16/tech/nvidia-chipmaker-earnings-stock/index.html,"May 16, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"San Francisco (CNN Business)Nvidia's first quarter earnings beat projections, sending the chipmaker's stock surging. On Thursday, Nvidia (NVDA) reported revenue of $2.22 billion, slightly above analysts' expectations of $2.20 billion. Shares rose over 6% on the news.  Nvidia, which makes high-end graphics chips for devices such as PC gaming systems and self-driving cars, said revenue declined about 31% compared to a year earlier. Its revenue has now fallen for two consecutive quarters.  In January, Nvidia lowered its sales outlook because of China's weakening economy, which led to a decline in the demand for video games. The decline this quarter was the result of a drop in revenue from graphics processing units, which can also be used to mine cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. When crypto prices took a dramatic plunge, Nvidia was hit hard. Revenue from its data division also declined. Its automotive unit was a bright spot, with revenue up 14% from a year earlier, to $166 million. After-hours trading saw shares rise to over $170. Nvidia's stock is up over 28% from the beginning of the year, but is still well below its high of over $289 in October. Nvidia was one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 in 2016 and 2017, but concerns about China's economy led to a drop in shares last year. Today's stock bump comes in the midst of an escalating trade war between the US and China. "
6,6,Crippling ransomware attacks targeting US cities on the rise,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/politics/ransomware-attacks-us-cities/index.html,"May 10, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN)Targeted ransomware attacks on local US government entities -- cities, police stations and schools -- are on the rise, costing localities millions as some pay off the perpetrators in an effort to untangle themselves and restore vital systems. The tally by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future -- one of the first efforts to measure the breadth of the assaults -- found that at least 170 county, city or state government systems have been attacked since 2013, including at least 45 police and sheriff's offices.  The firm compiled all known instances of ransomware infections of local government systems, a type of cyberattack that encrypts a computer's files, where the attacker demands payment --usually in bitcoin -- for a key to unlock them.  The federal government and the FBI do not track the attacks nationwide.  22 known attacks this year There have been 22 known public-sector attacks so far in 2019, which would outpace 2018, and that does not take into account that attacks often aren't reported until months or years after they're discovered.  The latest major city to be hit is Baltimore, which was infected with ransomware Tuesday. It has quarantined its networks and been forced to provide most of its municipal services manually. ""It's frustrating. It's unfortunate. But we're working through it,"" Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott said in a news conference Friday. At the end of March, New York's state capital, Albany, quietly admitted it had been hit with ransomware, on a Saturday -- a typical choice, as hackers calculate attacks can do more damage when IT staff aren't working. The city announced the attack the day it was discovered but downplayed its severity, announcing only that it had affected a handful of city services including the issuing of marriage licenses and birth certificates. Many of those problems were cleared up by the beginning of the workweek.  However, City Hall didn't mention that the Albany Police Department's systems had been significantly impacted. ""We were crippled, essentially, for a whole day,"" Gregory McGee, a patrolman who is vice president of the Albany Police Department's union, told CNN at the time. ""All of our incident reports, all of our crime reports, that's all digitized,"" McGee said, which meant cops had to write down everything that happened on paper. They showed up to work and had no access to staff schedules. ""We were like, who's working today?"" McGee said. ""We have no idea what our manpower is, who's supposed to be here."" The Albany mayor's office didn't respond to multiple requests for a status update on the attack, though a spokesperson had previously said the city would make an announcement once it had been cleaned up. Law enforcement also was targeted in Texas in March, when the Fisher County sheriff's office was infected and reportedly lost the ability to connect to a statewide law enforcement database. Late last month Genesee County, Michigan, which includes the town of Flint, announced that it was finally ransomware-free, after an attack effectively shut down the county's tax department for most of April. First attack in 2013 The first known small government ransomware infection hit the small town of Greenland, New Hampshire, in 2013 but the number of attacks didn't explode until 2016, when there were 46. The number dropped to 38 in 2017 -- indicative of a temporary worldwide reduction in ransomware infections -- before rising to 53 last year.  Industry estimates suggest ransomware attacks cost billions of dollars each year, though it's hard to put a precise number on the costs because there's no comprehensive record of attacks across the globe and not all of them are reported. The number of victims who have self-reported to the FBI's Internet Complaint Center has decreased in recent years. There were 2,673 cases in 2016; 1,783 in 2017; and 1,493 last year. Those numbers don't reflect all the cases the FBI is aware of through field office reports. This suggests hackers are being more discerning about who they decide to target, to maximize the amount of money they can make, according to Supervisory Special Agent Adam Lawson of the FBI's Major Cyber Crimes Unit. ""It's less of an individual user, and it's more targeting towards private sector, businesses, or public sector, municipalities, police departments, etc. Those attacks are going up, while attacks on individual users are going down,"" Lawson told CNN. ""I think our assessment is that (who gets targeted is) who's got more money. An individual user, if their computer is impacted by ransomware, it's kind of a cost-benefit analysis: 'I've had this computer for five years. I'm not going to pay you $300 to unlock my computer; I'll just go get another one.' Whereas for a business network, if you lock up the main controller or some vital records, it's much more complicated for them. So it's probably based on who's paying the money."" Perpetrators Attacks are carried out by a wide variety of actors, ranging from criminal gangs to people allegedly working at least tangentially with their countries' governments. Occasionally, international law enforcement has been able to coordinate and arrest ransomware attackers. In 2017, for instance, a joint operation of six law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, arrested three suspects in Romania and two in Hungary who were accused of running the CTB-Locker ransomware scam. But just as often, when US authorities have been able to identify and charge someone they believe has been responsible for an attack, they've been out of reach in countries where they cannot be extradited to the US. The US says two Iranians were responsible for the two most destructive municipal ransomware attacks in the US, which took place in Atlanta and Newark. The ransomware, called SamSam, successfully extorted more than $6 million in ransom, the Department of Justice said, and caused more than $30 million in damage. The two most destructive worldwide ransomware worms -- WannaCry and NotPetya, which came within a few months of each other in 2017 -- were allegedly created in North Korea and Russia before getting out of hand.  There are likely other suspects the FBI has identified but the agency is waiting for them to travel to countries where the US is able to coordinate arrests. ""We are aware of who some of these people are,"" Lawson said. ""Just because we don't come out and say it doesn't mean that we're not waiting for them to perhaps travel somewhere, where we can get them."" "
7,7,Bitcoin bull predicts prices will triple by 2021 — but fears 'melt-up' in stocks,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/09/investing/bitcoin-price-novogratz/index.html,"May 9, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Las Vegas (CNN Business)Bitcoin's recovery from last year's epic crash may have just begun.  Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz told CNN Business that the crypto currency will triple over the next 18 months and return to its all-time high of nearly $20,000. ""Out of the rubble, bitcoin has popped back up,"" Novogratz said from the sidelines of the SALT Conference in Las Vegas.   The notoriously volatile cryptocurrency is currently worth around $6,000, surging up from $3,100 last December. Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs investment banker, doesn't believe bitcoin will return to those lows. The catch would be if there was a devastating hack against a crypto exchange or a sudden shift in regulation.  ""It would take something like that to shatter this newfound confidence,"" said Novogratz, who is the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank.  Confidence did not appear to be shaken by a massive security breach at one of the world's largest currency exchanges. Bitcoin prices rallied despite the news that hackers stole $40 million of bitcoin from Binance, a Taiwan-based company.   ""For institutions to feel comfortable, you've got to have a lot less of this,"" he said.  Novogratz urged crypto exchanges to ""self-regulate"" to bolster their security and instill confidence in bitcoin.  ""A little bit of guardrails can go a long way,"" he said.  Others remain deeply skeptical of bitcoin due in part to the extreme price swings.  Nouriel ""Dr. Doom"" Roubini knocked bitcoin on Wednesday at SALT as the ""mother and father of all bubbles and busts."" Roubini, a professor at New York University, noted that bitcoin's crash far exceeds those experienced after the dotcom bubble and even the tulip mania of the 1630s.  Bitcoin has ""no future as a currency"" and is subject to ""massive manipulation,"" Roubini said.   'Frothy' stock market While Novogratz remains uber-bullish on bitcoin, he's concerned about overexuberance in the stock market.  ""We've got a chance of an equity melt-up. You're seeing that in the enthusiasm around IPOs,"" Novogratz said.  On Friday, Uber is going public in a blockbuster IPO set to raise around $9 billion or more. Last week, Beyond Meat (BYND) spiked 163% on its IPO day. It was the strongest first-day pop for a US company since March 2000 when Palm Inc. went public, according to Dealogic.  ""These frenzies rarely last. Gravity comes back into play,"" Novogratz said.  While he doesn't believe the market is at the top, Novogratz does see signs that things are getting ""frothy.""  ""Markets usually end in one super-spike, some searing frenzy of activity,"" he said.  Fed could bring on a 'melt-up' One catalyst for that kind of euphoria could be the Federal Reserve.   President Donald Trump has urged the Fed to slash interest rates by a full-percentage point — a startling move normally reserved for a crisis, not a healthy economy.  ""The Fed making a policy error by cutting into a strong economy might lead to a quick melt-up — and that could be the end,"" Novogratz said.  Billionaire Sam Zell similarly warned on Wednesday of a ""disaster"" if the Fed listens to Trump by sharply lowering interest rates. Such a move, Zell said, would deal an enormous blow to the US dollar.  Stephen Moore, a controversial campaign adviser to Trump, told the SALT audience that it was ""so stupid"" for the Fed to raise rates last year. Moore, who last week under pressure withdrew his name from consideration to join the Fed, urged the US central bank to swiftly lower rates.  Moore also cheered the Republican tax cuts, saying they worked ""even better than we thought they would.""  Asked about Moore's comments, Novogratz questioned the wisdom of the administration's decision to ""cut taxes into a strong economy"" and deepen America's budget deficit.  ""I'm glad Stephen Moore is not on the Fed,"" Novogratz added. "
9,9,Bitcoin has soared 60% this year. Meet the new buy-and-hold investment,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/investing/bitcoin-prices/index.html,"May 7, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Remember bitcoin? It's back. In a big way.  Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 60% to about $6,000 after plunging almost 75% in 2018.  Sure, the cryptocurrency is still far from its all-time highs of just under $20,000, which it hit in December 2017. But crypto investors are increasingly optimistic that the bitcoin (XBT) bounce of 2019 is real and that it and other cryptocurrencies may enjoy a steady march higher. It may be tempting to declare this year's bitcoin rebound as another sign of investor insanity. ""Uh-oh: Investors are doing it again. Cue the sounds of a bubble being inflated. All we're waiting for now is the inevitable pffft as the bubble pops."" But bitcoin may finally be trading at an appropriate price.  Bitcoin going legit The key for bitcoin going forward is for the gains to moderate a bit so history doesn't repeat itself. No one wants another bloodbath like in 2018. ""The huge crash in 2018 was a correction after a speculative mania. The gains in 2017 were astronomical,"" said Everett Millman, an analyst with Gainesville Coins, an investment firm specializing in precious metals and cryptocurrencies. Millman thinks some traders are still buying bitcoin because of ""hopes and dreams."" But he's cautiously optimistic that the worst days for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are behind them. So why has bitcoin bounced back so dramatically? Crypto investors increasingly believe bitcoin was oversold last year and is now becoming a legitimate investment for people looking to hedge the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations.  That could make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies a solid bet for buy-and-hold investors over the long haul and not just short-term traders looking for a quick pop in price.  ""The selling in bitcoin got exhausted last year and people started to come back in around $4,000,"" said Tyrone Ross, managing partner with NobleBridge Wealth Management. ""You are now starting to see more people cite bitcoin as a credible asset that you can use to diversify your portfolio. People are looking at bitcoin as a type of digital gold,"" Ross added. But many speculative investments remain tied to bitcoin and blockchain, the digital ledger that tracks cryptocurrency transactions as a public record. Shares of online retailer Overstock (OSTK), for example, have fallen more than 7% this year as the company struggles to prove to Wall Street that its crypto-related businesses can grow quickly enough to offset the continued losses in its core e-commerce business. Bitcoin going mainstream But bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are going mainstream with both individual investors and larger institutions.  The popular investing app Robinhood now offers investors the ability to buy bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. Fidelity and ETrade (ETFC) are reportedly getting ready to launch more crypto investing options for larger clients too.  And ICE (ICE), the owner of the NYSE, has launched Bakkt, a futures exchange for bitcoin and other cryptos. All of this adds legitimacy — and perhaps stability — to bitcoin. It no longer has to be the 21st century market equivalent of the Wild West. ""These solutions will provide infrastructure and services immensely superior to what is currently available in virtually all areas of the cryptocurrency industry. From payments to trading and custody, everything is improving at an impressive rate,"" said Fabio Canesin, co-founder of Nash, a cryptocurrency exchange. Helping crypto's mass-market appeal, people are actually starting to buy real stuff with bitcoin.  But investors should still expect a lot more bitcoin volatility.  A 30% drop in bitcoin should be considered routine — kind of like a 10% correction in stocks — said Martin Weiss, CEO of Weiss Ratings, an independent financial rating agency that launched a cryptocurrency rating service in 2018. But Weiss said bitcoin, as well as rival cryptocurrencies, including XRP, ethereum, cardano and EOS, should continue to rise over the long haul. And it wouldn't be a problem if the pace of the gains begins to slow. In fact, it might be a welcome development. ""Lets not forget that it takes time to get mainstream investors back and attract institutions. That trend is now in place,"" Weiss said.  ""Bitcoin can gradually crawl back to its all-time highs over several years, but hopefully it doesn't happen too quickly. If it does, investors could get burned again,"" he added. "
10,10,Hackers steal $40 million worth of bitcoin in massive security breach,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/tech/bitcoin-binance-hack/index.html,"May 8, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, says hackers stole more than $40 million worth of bitcoin from its customers.  The Taiwan-based company, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, announced that it discovered a ""large scale security breach"" Tuesday. It said hackers stole 7,000 bitcoins in one transaction. One bitcoin trades at nearly $6,000.  ""The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks,"" CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote in the statement. He said the company continues to investigate the breach. Zhao explained that the hackers waited for the best time to conduct their operation, but he didn't clarify specifically how the hack went undetected. ""The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks,"" he said. ""Once executed, the withdrawal triggered various alarms in our system. We stopped all withdrawals immediately after that."" The stolen bitcoin (XBT) will be reimbursed through Binance's secure asset fund, emergency insurance available in case of a breach. Binance warned that other accounts could be affected.  Binance also temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals, but it said bitcoin trading can continue. A security review of the incident will take at least a week.  ""We beg for your understanding in this difficult situation,"" Zhao wrote.  The hack is coming during a time when bitcoin is hot once again. Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 60% this year after plunging almost 75% in 2018. "
12,12,13 things you may have missed at Warren Buffett's annual gathering,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/business/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-recap/index.html,"May 6, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Tens of thousands of investors decamped to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday for Warren Buffett's annual shareholder's meeting to hear about the state of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Buffett and the company's vice chairman, Charlie Munger, spoke at length on a variety of topics, including how Berkshire's stakes in top companies, including Apple (AAPL) and Wells Fargo (WFC), are doing. They also discussed who should get credit on the economy and even Jeff Bezos' blood.  Here's what you might have missed: Problems with Kraft Heinz Berkshire, which holds s 27% stake in the food company, said that it did not report any income from Kraft Heinz because it doesn't have enough data from the company. Buffett said that the news is ""very unusual"" and suggested that it may be because of a dispute that Kraft Heinz is having with its auditor PwC.  What's different about Apple? Buffett is optimistic about Apple's future because it's ""an incredible product and management."" Berkshire owns more than 5% of Apple and sees that stake growing ""without spending a dime.""  But would he buy more? Here's what he told CNN's Poppy Harlow: Buffett thinks Bezos is 'unbelievable' Berkshire Hathaway bought its first stake in Amazon (AMZN) last week. But company stock isn't the only thing Buffett wants from CEO Jeff Bezos. He jokingly told investors he would get a blood transfusion from him. Buffett's admiration for Bezos didn't stop there, telling reporters that he ""kept looking at what was coming in and saw what was possible, and he's unbelievable."" He went on to talk glowingly about Amazon with CNN's Poppy Harlow: Wells Fargo made 'big mistakes' Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 10% stake in Wells Fargo. So, investors are wondering what Buffett thinks about the litany of scandals plaguing the bank. The Oracle of Omaha admitted that Wells Fargo has made some ""big mistakes"" and incentivized wrong behavior and did some ""crazy things."" But Buffett didn't blame former CEO Tim Sloan for the bank's numerous scandals, and Munger said he wishes Sloan was still there. The housing boom The housing market has done extremely well over the past few years thanks to low interest rates and steady job growth. That's great news for paint giant Benjamin Moore, the Berkshire-owned company. CEO Dan Calkins said that there is one problem. A well-publicized shortage of workers in the housing industry means that sales could be even better than they already are -- even though he said the housing market is ""hot."" Not concerned about Tesla Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk recently said that the company plans to offer auto insurance to buyers of its electric cars. That isn't making Buffett nervous. He joked that insurance companies were as likely to be as successful building cars as auto companies selling insurance.  If there's any competition he might be nervous of, it is from Progressive (PGR), a rival to the Bekshire Hathaway-owned Geico. A big mistake on Google Buffett and Munger both said that one of their biggest regrets was not buying shares of Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL). Munger joked they were just ""sucking their thumbs"" and that he feels like a ""horse's ass"" for not identifying it as a great investment earlier.  ""He's saying we blew it,"" Buffett quipped. Fixing US health care JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon,  Bezos are working together on a new healthcare company, called Haven.  He called the task ""herculean"" but he's bullish on the company being a success: Succession plan There's no way around it: Buffett and Munger are both very old.  So, what's next for the conglomerate? There was a hint on what could happen in the future when Berkshire executives Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, as well as portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, were invited to answer shareholder questions.  Buffett hinted that Jain, who is in charge of the company's insurance businesses, and Abel, who runs the non-insurance subsidiaries, could one day join him and Munger to answer shareholder questions. But Buffett cautioned that ""this format is not set in stone."" Bullish on Britain despite Brexit ""I would like to see Berkshire Hathaway more well known in the UK and Europe,"" Buffett said, adding that he'd love it if more businesses over there would look to Berkshire as a potential buyer of their assets.  He added that it was a mistake for the British people to vote to leave the European Union instead of remain in it.

14,14,When it makes sense to own more bonds than stocks,http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/success/wealth-coach-bonds-stocks/index.html,"May 2, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Is it smart to buy bonds over stocks? Unless you are extremely risk averse or depend on a steady stream of income for your daily expenses then it may not make sense to buy bonds instead of stocks. The stock market historically outperforms bonds over the long run. But bonds offer a degree of safety — particularly during times when investors are nervous about the broader economy, earnings growth and stock market valuations. Look no further than the fourth quarter of 2018. ""It's common for folks to look at bonds as a ballast at times when stocks aren't doing as well,"" said Eddy Vataru, senior portfolio manager of the Osterweis Total Return Fund, which invests primarily in investment grade bonds.  ""For the average investor, fixed income can serve an important function,"" he said.  Rates won't stay low forever Bonds may seem like a losing bet right now since yields are so low.  Interest rates around the globe have only gone up slightly from 2008 financial crisis levels, and the Federal Reserve seems content to keep rates on hold for the remainder of this year. That's why bonds don't make sense for everyone, according to Alan Adelman, senior fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""With interest rates still close to historic lows, you have to ask yourself where or why you should invest in bonds?"" Adelman said. But he thinks a mix of less risky investment grade corporate bonds and shorter-term Treasury bonds makes sense. Adelman said if you're under the age of 40, you'd mainly want to own a small percentage of bonds — maybe about 20% of your portfolio.  But he said that allocation should steadily move higher as you approach retirement. By the time you are 65, it's a good idea to have at least half of your investments in fixed income. Karen Harding, a partner in charge of the private wealth team at NEPC, also thinks bonds need to be a key part of any diversified portfolio. They can help you sleep at night during rocky times for the market.  ""Investors should own some bonds,"" she said. ""There are many attributes that make bonds attractive. They are not as volatile day-to-day and they can give you a nice, stable return."" And rates inevitably should start heading higher again if the US economy continues to show resilience. Corporate bonds can be a less risky way to invest in companies than stocks. After all, if a company finds itself in severe financial stress, bondholders have more legal rights than owners of the stock. ""What you get from a bond is a legal claim. If a company goes bankrupt, creditors are likely to get something back while stockholders usually get wiped out and get nothing,"" she said. Still, even conservative investors shouldn't ignore stocks in favor of bonds entirely.  Many quality blue chip companies pay dividends, which have yields that are at or above many benchmark bond rates, such as Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG).

16,16,An NFL star gave his teammates Amazon stock. There's a better gift,http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/investing/gift-stocks/index.html,"Apr 25, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Are you looking for the perfect Mother's Day or birthday present? What about stocks? Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson gave the gift that keeps on giving, when he gifted 13 of his teammates' $12,000 worth of Amazon (AMZN) stock this week.  Amazon is looking like a pretty good stock selection. The online retailer's shares are up nearly 27% this year. Over the past ten years, its ascent is almost unreal: a 2000% increase.  Kanye West gave his wife, Kim Kardashian, shares of Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Adidas (ADDDF) last Christmas. All of the stocks have climbed since.  West and Russell, who earlier this month became the highest paid football player in the league, sure can afford to give these presents with potential. But you don't have to be a wealthy celebrity to gift single shares. Stock gifts could end up being wise long-term investments. Unless that stock falls, that is. Stocks go up and down, but the S&P 500 is up 17% this year, and 239% over the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv. The pattern of a single company's shares might look very different, but owning a little could inspire the gift receiver to build a portfolio. Disney at the top Stock gifting site GiveAShare.com ranks its top 10 most popular options every quarter, which are led by Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Nike (NKE) at the top. Disney is the No. 1 pick every year, said GiveAShare founder Rick Roman. The footprint of the American consumer is all over the most-gifted stock list, which also includes Apple, Coca-Cola (CCEP), Starbucks (SBUX), Under Armour (UA) and Nintendo (NTDOF), as well as Ford (F). Less orthodox popular options include shares of the Atlanta Braves (BATRK) and Manchester United (MANU).  Out of the bunch, Apple has done best this year. IPOs like last week's floating of Pinterest (PINS), also got a lot of attention, Roman said. He expects the same to happen with Uber when it goes public. It seems people love giving what they consume.  The website Stockpile offers a similar way to gifting shares. Its trending ranking includes many of the same options, as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and the Vanguard 500 ETF. Exchange-traded funds track the equity market with a slight lag and are popular investment product to gain exposure to a whole sector or section of a market. The gift offers diversity rather than leaving the receiver with exposure to just one company, which is why ETFs are generally better long-term investments than individual stocks. The SPDR S&P ETF is up 16.9% this year. Stockpile also names the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a trending option. But cryptocurrencies have had quite a different performance compared with regular stocks. While the Bitcoin Trust has rallied some 71% this year, it dropped 60% last year. "
17,17,US bitcoin trader and girlfriend could face death penalty over Thai 'seastead',http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/thai-sea-home-us-bitcoin-trader-scli-intl/index.html,"Apr 19, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)An American bitcoin trader and his girlfriend could face the death penalty after they were accused of threatening Thailand's sovereignty by building and living in a ""sea home"" off the coast of Phuket. Chad Elwartowski and his partner Nadia Supranee Thepdet have fled their home, built atop a platform around 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, and gone into hiding after authorities revoked the American's visa. He had promoted ""seasteads"" on social media and claimed his home did not fall under the sovereignty of any country, which Thai authorities have said is untrue. He repeated the claim on Thursday, writing the home is ""outside of Thailand territorial waters."" The couple could face life imprisonment or the death penalty under the country's Immigration Act, but authorities told CNN they are unaware if the pair are still in the country or its waters. ""Nadia and I are still safe,"" Elwartowski wrote on Facebook on Tuesday, adding he was unsure whether their home had been destroyed. ""Whether it is still there or not does not matter much to me. I'm more concerned about Nadia being driven from her home country and her family. Her son is worried. I hope they can be reunited some day soon."" ""It was my home,"" Elwartowski added. In an earlier post, he said the pair did not design or construct the home but worked with the company that did.  ""As long as Nadia and I are able to live through this that is all that matters to us right now. We just want to live,"" he wrote. Thailand's navy has said the pair are threatening the country's sovereignty. ""By claiming they own a floating house and using social media tried to sell this kind of house, also they claimed that their house is not under any country's sovereignty, which is not true. And this could cause other people to misunderstand and it is threatening our national security,"" said Colonel Kataporn Kumthieng, the chief of Phuket's Immigration office. He described the case as ""urgent."" The Thai Navy had previously posted a video of the home on Facebook, writing that ""the navy is required to resolve the problem."" Elwartowski had taken part in videos and podcasts promoting the use of ""seasteads,"" frequently mentioning how he was unaffected by policy decisions and taxation laws set by governments. The ""seasteading"" movement, which began in earnest in 2008 in California with the financial backing of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, has been likened to the phenomenon of micronations for its vision of establishing sovereign communities outside the control of existing states. Ocean Builders, the company behind Elwartowski's seastead, said in a statement on its website that it had constructed the home, the first in what it hoped would be an opening round of 20 units. The couple were ""volunteers excited about the prospect of living free"", it added.  Insisting the six-meter platform was 13 nautical miles from Thailand and in international waters, the company accused the Thai authorities of acting as ""judge jury and executioner of the historic very first seastead."" It hoped to resolve the issue ""diplomatically,"" it said.  The Seasteading Institute, the organization backed by Thiel, is currently in negotiations with the government of French Polynesia to build a floating city in a semi-autonomous ""seazone"" within its territorial waters.

18,18,How Mueller used Bitcoin to catch Russia,http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/tech/bitcoin-mueller-russia/index.html,"Apr 20, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Russian operatives used cryptocurrency at almost every stage in their online efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report on his investigation.  Systems used in the hacking of the Democratic Party were paid for using Bitcoin, as were online hosting services that supported websites which published hacked materials and were used in the targeting of disinformation at American voters. The hacking and disinformation campaigns accounted for the vast majority of Russia's online efforts to influence the 2016 election.  All Bitcoin transactions are posted to an immutable public ledger, known as a blockchain. While the blockchain doesn't contain obvious identifying information about the person behind a transaction, once someone figures out a user is responsible for one transaction it can be possible to track their entire Bitcoin history.  Russian agents, including those from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, had sought to, as the Mueller indictment of GRU agents last July outlined, ""capitalize on the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies."" But while Bitcoin allowed Russians to ""avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds,"" according to the same indictment, it wasn't enough to evade Mueller's investigation.  Tim Cotten, a blockchain developer and security researcher who has done extensive work in tracking Russian Bitcoin accounts unearthed by Mueller's team, noted in an interview with CNN Business that trading Bitcoins on exchanges usually requires users to set up Bitcoin wallets that are tied to an email address. Federal investigators were able to access at least some of the email accounts used in the operation, which, Cotten says, would have made tracing Bitcoin transactions a lot easier.  Investigators' access to the ""the other side of the blockchain equation,"" as he described it, was important because, ""Rather than having to search the blockchain for clues, they already had all of the receipts demonstrating which accounts were under the GRU's control."" The Russians used stolen and false identities in setting up some of these accounts, according to Mueller's team, but had used some of the same accounts to purchase servers and website domains involved in the hacking of the Democratic Party and the publishing of the hacked materials, Mueller's indictment outlines. That, Cotten said, would have made it easier for investigators to tie the case together.  A virtual private network, a way to obscure the location from which a user is accessing the internet, was also purchased using Bitcoin, Mueller found; that network was used to login at @Guccifer_2, the infamous Twitter account that communicated with Wikileaks and others, Mueller's investigation found.

19,19,Owning a Warhol: How bitcoin could change the art world,http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/tech/bitcoin-art-maecenas-singapore/index.html,"Apr 19, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)British artist David Hockney smashed records last year when his ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)"" sold at auction in New York for $90 million.   Not a single dollar from that sale went to the artist himself. Hockney sold the original artwork in 1972 for just $18,000, leaving subsequent owners to reap the enormous rewards of its increase in value.  One Singapore-based company hopes to change sales like this forever by using blockchain technology to allow artists to retain an interest in their work even as other investors buy into it.  Tokenising artwork Maecenas is a three-year-old startup looking to revolutionize the art world through ""tokenization."" It allows investors to use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to buy a share of an artwork. The value of the shares — or tokens — rise and fall in a similar way to stocks.  According to Maecenas CEO Marcelo Garcia-Casil, this allows original owners to maintain partial ownership of a work as its value grows, and opens up the market to younger investors.  ""What we're doing with the fractionalization or tokenization of art is creating a stock market experience when it comes to investing in art,"" he said.  ""We're not going with this platform to art experts — we're bringing it to people who may be investing in art for the first time."" Art without a home  Maecenas successfully tokenized and sold a million-dollar Andy Warhol painting in 2018, and it expects to do the same with a Picasso later this year. There's an obvious drawback to selling art in this way. With multiple owners and no single home for the works, they're often stored in restricted areas that are not accessible to the public. But some investors say the art market is perfectly suited to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The potential use of bitcoin in previously unexplored industries, like the art market, is unprecedented, said Kenrick Drijkoningen, the founding partner of Lunex. His venture capital fund invests exclusively in blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. ""You have ownership, it's censorship resistant, it's portable and the monetary supply [is finite],"" Drijkoningen explained. ""There will only ever be 20 million of them [bitcoin]."" Singapore's crypto-revolution Maecenas is part of a much bigger revolution underway in financial technology, and Singapore is playing a leading role, according to Lunex principal Tushar Agarwal.  ""Singapore does an amazing job of attracting that talent, of making sure that they don't inhibit innovation for the sake of regulating,"" he said.  While the city state is regarded by some as one of the most crypto-friendly places on earth, others are concerned about the lack of regulation. In January, Singapore's Monetary Authority issued a public warning about online scams involving cryptocurrency. Agarwal says the industry will continue to grow because traditional finance is unable to keep up with the speed of globalized markets.  ""The amount of time that it takes for [banks] to settle transactions just hasn't kept up with the pace that is required,"" he said. ""Yes, it's highly highly volatile — but that's the risk that you take with any new industry... it's like the Wild West.""  "

Coinbase said Thursday that the card, which will convert crypto coins to pounds, can also be used to withdraw money from ATMs. A related app will let customers decide which digital currency to use. ""Coinbase Card supports all crypto assets available to buy and sell on the Coinbase platform, meaning they can pay for a meal with bitcoin, or use ethereum to fund their train ticket home,"" Zeeshan Feroz, the head of Coinbase's UK arm, said in a blog post. It's the first card of its kind in the United Kingdom, according to the company. It will roll out in other European countries soon. The announcement comes as bitcoin prices are emerging from a lengthy slump. Bitcoin (XBT) jumped above the $5,000 level earlier this month for the first time since November.  Experts say the price spike is likely to attract new investors. It could get a further boost as companies like Coinbase, which lets users trade cryptocurrencies and store them in digital wallets, makes digital coins easier to spend. A similar card that allowed users to draw from Coinbase accounts was previously released in the United States by Shift Payments. It has since been shuttered, though Shift — which now goes by Apto Payments — is a partner on the UK venture. In Europe, one deterrent to greater adoption may be hefty fees. There is a 2.49% fee per transaction in the United Kingdom. That goes up to 2.69% per transaction elsewhere in Europe, and 5.49% in countries further afield. Most Visa cards issued by banks don't charge any fees for transactions in their home market.  "

US futures added 0.3% to trade at $62.70 per barrel, pushing gains for this year to 38%. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 0.8% to just under $70 per barrel. ""With output falling for a fourth month thanks to continued OPEC production cuts and sanction on Iran and Venezuela, oil prices are well supported,"" said Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index, a broker. Recent positive manufacturing news from China has also eased fears of a dramatic slowdown in the world's second largest economy. Weak growth in China would have reduced demand for oil.

Trade talks: Sensitive trade negotiations between the United States and China are set to resume on Wednesday. China's Vice Premier Liu He is traveling to Washington with a delegation of trade negotiators just days after another set of discussions wrapped up in Beijing. There have been positive signs about a potential deal in recent days. China said this week that it would add fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled drugs from May 1, fulfilling a pledge that Chinese President Xi Jinping had made to US President Donald Trump. 3. Brexit chaos: The British pound has rallied after Prime Minister Theresa May said she would implement any Brexit deal that was agreed by a majority in the UK parliament. May also said she would ask the European Union for another short extension to Brexit, and work with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a compromise.  The pound increased 0.4% against the dollar on Wednesday to trade at $1.31.  The political situation in the United Kingdom remains highly uncertain. It's not clear whether the European Union will grant a short extension to Brexit, and there's still no consensus in Britain on how to exit the bloc. 4. Bitcoin surge: Bitcoin prices shot up 15% Tuesday, briefly topping $5,000 for the first time since November. Analysts were scratching their heads trying to find a reason for the spike.

24,24,Bitcoin prices are soaring again,http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/investing/bitcoin-prices-today/index.html,"Apr 2, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Bitcoin prices shot up 15% Tuesday and briefly rose above the $5,000 level for the first time since November. But good luck finding a reason to explain the sudden spike. Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of deVere Group, simply said in a report that ""there is a growing sense that Bitcoin is back.""  Green added that ""this dramatic jump is likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines,"" including big institutions. Wild swings for bitcoin are the norm. So this shouldn't be all that surprising, argued Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd, in a report.  ""Bitcoin is a kind of a beast which has the ability to score more than 20% gain on a daily basis and we have seen this kind of rally towards the end of 2017 before the price crashed,"" Aslam wrote.  He added that the big bitcoin (XBT) spike ""is going to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sideline and waiting for this moment.""  Reason for the bitcoin price surge is a 'mystery' Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at currency brokerage FXTM, agreed. He said in a research note ""sudden and explosive swings are nothing new in the world of cryptocurrency"" but ""the reason behind bitcoin's aggressive jump remains a mystery.""  Still, Otunuga conceded that the ""bulls could be back in town."" In other words, bitcoin is higher simply because people are buying bitcoin. It's a classic case of momentum investing on steroids and there might not be any real fundamental rhyme or reason to justify the spike.  Bitcoin has always been a favorite plaything for traders looking to cash in on sudden moves. This recent rally may be nothing more than that. David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview with CNN Business Tuesday that the rally in bitcoin is likely another example of ""a rebound in risk.""  Stocks surged in the first quarter -- despite worries about the fact that earnings are expected to decline in the first quarter and that bond yields are falling on concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth. ""This is another sign of exuberance. It's not justified,"" Spika said. Nonetheless, there is no denying that bitcoin is once again having a moment. Bitcoin is now up about 25% this year and more than 60% from a recent low of around $3,100 in December.   Prices appeared to stabilize Wednesday at just under $5,000. Bitcoin evangelists swear that more consumers will use it and other forms of digital currencies such as litecoin, ethereum and XRP/ripple to buy things.  And more online retailers, such as Overstock (OSTK), Shopify (SHOP) and Newegg, are accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Wall Street is starting to recognize bitcoin as well.  Mutual fund giant Fidelity established a trading platform for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies late last year. But the cryptocurrency still has a long way to go before it's anywhere close to its all-time high though. Prices peaked near $20,000 in late 2017. "
25,25,How much gold and silver should you own?,http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/success/wealth-coach-gold-silver/index.html,"Mar 22, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)For someone like me that can't afford to buy an ounce of gold, would it be just as good owning several ounces of silver vs. a half ounce of gold? Great question. Gold, trading for more than $1,300 an ounce, is a much pricier investment than silver, which currently costs about $15 an ounce. In other words, you could purchase more than 40 ounces of silver for the same price as one half ounce of gold. Investors treat gold more like a currency than silver, a metal that has many more industrial uses than gold. So if you want to buy silver, don't necessarily expect it to perform in tandem with gold. Silver prices are actually down nearly 25% over the past five years while gold prices have been relatively flat. Silver has been hit harder, because investors are worried about slowing global economic growth. But both metals have undeperformed the broader stock market.   Still, investing experts say that gold, silver and other precious metals like platinum and palladium, could make sense as a small part of a broader investment portfolio.  Many people own them simply to hedge against big pullbacks in stocks. They are also viewed as a good alternative to government-backed currencies -- which tend to fluctuate more with central bank decisions on interest rates.  Investors view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as assets that could behave similarly to gold and silver. Now that the US Federal Reserve is apparently done raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, that should bode well for gold and silver, when rates are low. ""Metals are set to be primary beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve simply catching up to futures markets priced for easing. Further hikes are unlikely,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone in a tweet Friday.    But silver might be more attractive than gold right now -- and not just because it's a heck of a lot cheaper to purchase. Many commodities analysts closely follow the ratio of the price of one ounce of gold to one ounce of silver. It's flashing a buy signal. ""Historically, there have been only a few occasions that the gold-silver ratio traded above 80,"" said analysts at Blanchard, a precious metals investing firm in New Orleans, in a recent report. ""The gold/silver ratio stands at 85 right now. That signals that silver is dramatically undervalued,"" the Blanchard analysts said.  That said, if you are going to buy gold, silver or any other metals, it's probably easier to do so through an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of the metal instead of pulling a Scrooge McDuck and actually purchasing bars and coins to swim around in. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) is one of the largest funds in the world, with about $33 billion in assets.  For silver, there's the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which has nearly $5 billion in assets.  And if you're more comfortable owning stocks instead of metals, there are ETFs for gold (GDX) and silver miners (SIL) as well. The industry is in the midst of a major wave of consolidation and mining stocks could benefit from more merger speculation. What's the best way to invest for the long haul?

For at least 17 minutes on Friday, a suspected terrorist streamed live video of a mass murder at a mosque in New Zealand. New Zealand police alerted Facebook to the livestream, and Facebook said it quickly removed the shooter's account and the video. Facebook also said it was removing praise or support for the shooting ""as soon as we're aware."" But that was not enough for Fernandes, CEO of the Malaysian airline company. Although Fernandes said he was a ""social media fan,"" the livestream caused him to leave Facebook. ""It is a great platform to communicate,"" he tweeted after canceling his Facebook account. ""Strong engagement and very useful but New Zealand was too much for me to take along with all the other issues."" Fernandes said he had been ""a victim of so many fake bitcoin and other stories"" and decided to close down his account.  Facebook needs to ""clean up and not just think of financials,"" he said. On Saturday, Facebook said that it removed 1.5 million videos of the attack. ""We continue to work around the clock to remove violating content using a combination of technology and people...,"" Mia Garlnick, spokesperson for Facebook New Zealand, said on Twitter.  Fernandes also said he was debating leaving Twitter, but said Sunday that ""on Twitter I think the battle for me goes on."" Fernandes has nearly 1.3 million Twitter followers and has sent more than 20,000 tweets. Correction: The headline on an earlier version of this article misstated AirAsia's name. "
27,27,Former Mt. Gox chief Mark Karpeles acquitted of most charges in major bitcoin case,http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/tech/mark-karpeles-mt-gox/index.html,"Mar 15, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)The man who oversaw the collapse of a giant bitcoin exchange was found guilty Friday of falsifying data but acquitted of other charges, meaning he's unlikely to go to prison. French businessman Mark Karpeles was the owner and CEO of Mt. Gox, which was once the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Based in Japan, the company imploded in 2014 after losing nearly $500 million worth of bitcoin belonging to investors.  Tokyo prosecutors had indicted Karpeles on a series of charges, including embezzlement and aggravated breach of trust, and called for a 10-year prison sentence. But the Tokyo District Court on Friday found Karpeles not guilty of the other charges and handed down a suspended prison sentence for the falsification conviction. The court also ordered him to pay for part of the cost of the trial.  Karpeles, 33, was found guilty of illegally altering Mt. Gox's electronic records to falsely inflate the company's holdings by $33.5 million. He was sentenced to 2½ years in prison with a 4-year suspension, which means he won't have to serve time unless he commits a criminal act in the next four years. Karpeles's acquittal on the more serious allegations of embezzlement and aggravated breach of trust was a surprise. The conviction rate in Japan after prosecutors file criminal charges is above 99%. ""I am happy to be judged not guilty for embezzlement and breach of trust,"" Karpeles said in a statement to CNN. ""I will discuss with my lawyers and decide how to proceed on the remaining charge."" He had maintained his innocence throughout the trial, blaming a computer hack for Mt. Gox's loss of 850,000 bitcoins belonging to its users in 2014. At the time, the huge cryptocurrency hoard was worth about $470 million.  But the company, at the time the world's largest bitcoin exchange, was already in dire financial straits before the alleged hack. Mt. Gox was struggling with its cash flow after US government agents seized $5 million from its accounts in 2013 for allegedly lying on bank documents. That sum was 13 times the amount of revenue the company collected over most of the previous year. The loss of the massive stash of users' bitcoins in 2014 plunged Mt. Gox into bankruptcy and left behind some 30,000 angry investors. Karpeles was arrested in Tokyo in 2015 and spent more than 11 months in custody.  In an interview with CNN last month, he described his time in detention in Japan as a ""nightmare."" He said that police interrogated him for 50 days straight without a single day off, and that he often considered pleading guilty just to end the ordeal.

28,28,Winklevoss twins on their bitcoin bet: 'Money is the oldest social network',http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/11/tech/winklevoss-twins-crypto-sxsw/index.html,"Mar 11, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Austin, Texas (CNN)For years, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were known for the company they didn't launch: Facebook. Now, the pair hope to be known for their bet on cryptocurrency, which they liken to a different kind of social network. ""Money is the oldest social network and arguably the strongest,"" Cameron Winklevoss told CNN Business at SXSW in Austin. ""And crypto is one of the strongest networks of value ever in the world and will continue to be so, so hopefully [we'll be] pioneers in that space to some extent."" The twins, who spent years in litigation accusing Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea and received a $65 million settlement, have made a name for themselves in the cryptocurrency space by becoming some of the first bitcoin billionaires and launching their own crypto exchange, Gemini, to buy and sell digital currencies.  Despite the volatility of cryptocurrencies -- with bitcoin soaring to around $20,000 and now sinking to just below $4,000 -- the brothers remain bullish on its future. ""Yes, there's been some ups and downs in between, but overall if you zoom out long enough, the trend is going in the right direction,"" Tyler Winklevoss told CNN Business at SXSW in Austin. ""The graph is still up and to the right."" Although they wouldn't discuss their trading behavior or whether they'd sold a major portion of what they own, Tyler Winklevoss confirmed they still have holdings in various cryptos, including bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, tezos and filecoin. But he called the space ""a scary, wild, wild west type situation"" when they first got into it in 2012. At the time, a bitcoin was only valued at $8. ""We've tried to solve that problem by creating Gemini, which allows you to engage with crypto in a regulated compliant trusted way,"" Tyler Winklevoss said. ""We're trying to make it easy to onboard because our own experience in the space was very difficult, scary, and risky, and we've spent the last five years trying to mitigate that."" Cameron Winklevoss said Gemini, which was founded in 2014, continues to grow in the US, Asia, Canada and UK, attracting new talent from the financial services industry and top tech companies. It's now focused on expanding into Europe and recently launched a mobile app. ""It's been really fun to be a part of two major revolutions or movements,"" Tyler Winklevoss said. ""I guess we sort of have a thing for networks: Facebook (FB) being a social network and then money or crypto being the ultimate social network."" ""Instead of trading pictures or connecting with people, which is important and very cool, you can trade value,"" he added. Although the crypto industry still receives criticism from seasoned investors like Warren Buffett, the space is also evolving. In fact, Facebook is reportedly looking to build its own stablecoin, or coins pegged to actual currencies like the US dollar. ""It's very exciting and validating for the space of crypto,"" Cameron Winklevoss said of the news. "
29,29,Should investors own any bitcoin in their portfolio?,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/success/wealth-coach-bitcoin/index.html,"Feb 28, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)How much bitcoin should I own? This is a controversial question.  Bitcoin evangelists would argue that you should go all in on cryptocurrencies because the digital assets could be the future of money.  Fans of bitcoin also claim that the value of cryptocurrencies should be more stable because there is a finite supply of coins. Governments can always print more money. But bitcoin skeptics, including investing legend Warren Buffett, think bitcoin is something to be avoided at all costs.  Buffett called it ""rat poison squared"" last year and said at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) annual shareholder meeting that it and other crytpocurrencies ""will come to bad endings.""  Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger went a step further, saying at last year's meeting that bitcoin is ""just dementia.""  ""It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can't be left out,"" Munger added.  Munger is correct to note that bitcoin was, for a time, a speculative mania.  But the bubble has burst for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, litecoin and ripple/XRP during the past two years.  Bitcoin (XBT) enjoyed an epic rally from just under $1,000 at the start of 2017 to nearly $20,000 by the end of that year. It now trades around $3,800.  Needless to say, something that volatile is not for the faint of heart. And even after its dramatic drop, some financial advisers say people should be very careful with bitcoin. ""I don't see a compelling reason for someone to own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in their portfolio. It is highly speculative. There is so much risk,"" said John Norris, managing director of wealth and investments with Oakworth Capital Bank. Gold or silver may be a safer bet than bitcoin Norris said he understands that some investors consider bitcoin a hedge against currency fluctuations. But he said there are other investments that provide similar value and have a much longer track record. ""If you want to diversify away from currencies, go to the coin shop. Buy gold or silver,"" Norris said. Joe Mallen, chief investment officer of Helios Quantitative Research, agreed. He noted that he was at a client dinner in late 2017 where retirees were asking about bitcoin. That convinced him it was a bubble.  ""If you really have no idea what bitcoin is but people are telling you it's the next big thing, you should avoid it,"" Mallen said. This isn't to say that investors should steer clear of bitcoin-related investments entirely. There are well-known companies making big bets on blockchain, the public digital ledger of transactions that is the backbone for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Think blockchain instead of bitcoin Many companies, like software and services giant IBM (IBM), graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) and payments company Square (SQ), have blockchain and other crypto-related businesses.  Even banking titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM) recently launched JPM Coin to help speed up some cross-border client transactions. Its coin comes despite the fact that CEO Jamie Dimon is a noted crypto critic who once said he'd fire people for trading bitcoin. Norris conceded that a small wager on bitcoin could make sense. You just need to have realistic expectations. There's a greater chance that the investment won't pan out than there is of it making you rich.  ""If you want to have a little fun, bitcoin is like betting on the ponies,"" he said. ""It's a roll of the dice. You're taking a flier. You could win big. But you can lose your shirt on this.""

30,30,Overstock is still a retailer but it wants to be a blockchain company,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/investing/overstock-retail-sale-blockchain/index.html,"Feb 25, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Online retailer Overstock really doesn't want to be in the e-commerce business anymore. Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock and a blockchain evangelist has made no secret of the fact that he wants to run a blockchain business, not a retailer. But investors aren't exactly sure what that means.  ""It's still confusing to most people -- even our own investors. Very few have done their homework,"" Byrne told CNN Business on Friday.  That's why Byrne said he plans to give a lot more detail about the big picture plans for Overstock's blockchain businesses when it reports its latest earnings sometime in March. The company has made some moves into blockchain over the past few years.  It launched the Medici Ventures investing firm to focus on blockchain technology, a public digital ledger of transactions, and it is also developing its own tZero security tokens for e-commerce and trading.  Byrne told CNBC in December 2017 that the goal was to sell or reorganize the core Overstock business within 60 to 90 days so he could go all-in on blockchain. That didn't happen.  The CEO reiterated his plan to get out of online retail last November, telling the Wall Street Journal he hoped to have a sale done by this February. Investors seem to believe him.  Shares of Overstock (OSTK) have shot up more than 20% since then, even as bitcoin (XBT) prices have tumbled nearly 15% during the same time frame.  Despite the emphasis on switching Overstock to a blockchain company, Wall Street seems more focused on trying to figure out when the online retail business will finally be sold -- and who might buy it. Some on Wall Street believe that Walmart (WMT), which has made numerous digital commerce acquisitions already in order to become more competitive with Amazon (AMZN), could be interested. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment. However, Overstock shares have pulled back sharply as Byrne's February target draws near without any sign of a deal being imminent. Overstock fell 9% on Thursday.  ""It does not surprise me that nothing has happened yet,"" said Bill Baker, an analyst with GARP Research. He notes that retail is a notoriously tough and competitive business and that Overstock has been losing money in it. But Baker thinks a sale for Overstock's retail business could still materialize and that it could fetch about $100 million. Bet on blockchain may eventually pay off big Overstock's current market value is just north of $650 million though. So does that mean that the company's blockchain businesses are really worth more than half a billion dollars?  Baker believes they are. He said Overstock is making the right call to focus on the more rapidly growing blockchain world instead of the perennially challenged retail business and that the stock could rally further thanks to tZero and Medici. Byrne sounds frustrated by how difficult it is to remain in retail as well.  He noted that online home furnishings company Wayfair (W), a rival to Overstock that offers very low prices, is unprofitable and has lost nearly $1 billion during the past three years. ""There's no point in trying to compete,"" Byrne said. ""It's way too expensive."" "
31,31,How to best diversify your investment portfolio,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/success/wealth-coach-diversify-portfolio/index.html,"Feb 21, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)What are the criteria you look out for when buying stocks, especially when you want to diversify your portfolio? Diversification is a tricky thing to achieve these days if you, like many investors, stick primarily to mutual funds and ETFs that are tied to top indexes. It's especially tough if your funds rank their holdings by how big the companies are. Take a look at the S&P 500. The popular index of blue chip US companies might as well be a tech fund. Five of the six most-valuable companies in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). They make up nearly 15% of the fund's total assets. ""People have been fooled into thinking that the S&P 500 is diversified,"" said Lamar Villere, manager of the Villere Balanced Fund. Do your homework and know what you own Villere told CNN Business that investors have to do their homework and not base decisions on faulty assumptions.  Here's an example: His fund owns Steris (STE), a medical equipment company based in the UK, as well as Euronet (EEFT), an electronic payments firm with its headquarters in Kansas.  Which company is more exposed to Brexit concerns and sluggish growth in the EU? Euronet. That's because Steris generated more than 70% of its sales last year from the US while Euronet only got a quarter of its revenue from America. Nearly half its sales were from Germany, the UK, Poland, Spain, Italy, Greece and France. But Villere is confident both companies will continue to post solid earnings, despite geopolitical turmoil.  The key lesson for investors to learn is that if you own quality companies that can do well in most environments, you don't have to worry as much.  A truly diversified portfolio should have companies of all sizes There are other ways to diversify your portfolio, too. Villere said he typically finds better investing opportunities with smaller and mid-sized companies, because their stocks are not as widely followed by Wall Street. So they often wind up being less expensive.  But he doesn't think investors should shun giant companies either. In the spirit of diversification, it makes sense to own a mix of companies of various sizes — and hold on to them for several years. Villere said his fund's top holding is payments giant (and Dow component) Visa (V), which he said he first bought in 2011. Villere also said he bought Apple (AAPL) after Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and just sold it last year after a ""great ride."" Don't get caught up in the daily news cycle ""We're more intent on finding the best possible companies. We try not to be heavy traders and second guess ourselves,"" Villere said. ""It does not serve you well to invest based on headlines."" Louis Florentin-Lee, a portfolio manager with Lazard Asset Management, agreed with that. He told CNN Business he likes ""companies with sufficiently strong economic advantages"" that are making a product that's ""invaluable"" to their customers. ""We don't care what sector a company is in,"" Florentin-Lee said, adding that buying shares of healthy companies is increasingly important at a time when investors are worried about global trade tension.  Any investor should want to own businesses that can not only withstand the threat of tariffs but even be able to raise prices if they must without worrying that they will lose sales. Florentin-Lee said some examples of these types of companies are British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO), German flavors and fragrances maker Symrise (SYIEY) and credit card company MasterCard (MA).

32,32,JPMorgan's move into crypto puts the rest of the industry on notice,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/19/business/jpmorgan-jpm-coin-banks-blockchain/index.html,"Feb 19, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)JPMorgan Chase's splashy new digital coin could change how banks approach blockchain and cryptocurrency. The initial applications of JPM Coin aren't revolutionary. JPMorgan (JPM) said last week it would facilitate the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional accounts. JPM Coin is just a prototype that can only be used by some of the bank's corporate customers.  But the news last week attracted a lot of buzz, because it could force other banks to follow with big blockchain or crypto-related releases of their own. ""More banks will take it seriously,"" said Param Vir Singh, a professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. Watch this space  The financial industry broadly agrees that money should move around the globe faster and more efficiently. ""Trillions of dollars slosh around the world via an antiquated system of slow payments and added fees,"" CB Insights analysts said in a recent report. That's why banks in recent years have shown interest in digital coins and blockchain, a tamper-proof digital ledger.  Blockchain is particularly appealing because it could allow banks to clear payments faster and more securely, using technology that CB Insights said would dramatically cut processing times and reduce the need for third parties to get involved with transactions.  ""There are only so many ways you can optimize payments,"" said John Velissarios, Accenture's blockchain technology lead. ""The tokenization of cash is certainly one of them."" With the launch of JPM Coin, JPMorgan has shown it wants to get out in front of this transition, despite its previous skepticism.  That could push other banks to show they're in the game, too. Singh said banks that have a large number of institutional clients, such as Citigroup (C), will feel the most pressure.  Citi has a sizable Treasury and Trade Solutions unit, which manages cash and payments for companies that operate in multiple countries. The bank actually tested out a ""Citi Coin"" in 2014 and 2015 at an innovation lab in Dublin, Ireland. The bank built the pilot so it would understand how money could eventually move on the blockchain, according to Manish Kohli, Citi's global head of payments and receivables. It was never rolled out to clients, but Kohli said the experiment informs Citi's current approach to digital coins and blockchain.  The bank decided it made more sense to help build out national payment infrastructures globally to support real-time payments, and to work directly with clients who want to incorporate blockchain into their payment flows, he said. That's what the bank has been doing with Nasdaq and Allianz, for example. ""You need every bank on the planet to be able to talk and communicate and be part of this system,"" rather than proprietary systems that benefit only ""a handful of banks"" and aren't universally adopted, Kohli said. Citi declined to comment about JPM Coin in particular. Other financial institutions are thinking about how to best use this technology, too. Bank of America (BAC), for example, has 82 US patents or published patent applications tied to crypto, blockchain and related tech, according to Envision IP, a law firm that specializes in intellectual property research. That's more than any other major bank or financial services company reviewed by the firm. JPMorgan's advantage The hype around JPMorgan's rollout of JPM Coin is partially about timing. Enthusiasm around crypto is more muted than it was at the end of 2017, when bitcoin prices spiked. ""If this announcement had been made a year and a half ago at the peak of the crypto craze, I'm not sure how big the impact would have been,"" said Arieh Levi, an analyst at CB Insights. The fact that JPMorgan, the nation's biggest bank, is throwing its weight behind such a venture at this juncture lends heft, he added. JPMorgan will have a leg up because of its size — and because it's a first mover. That could help it attract or retain clients. ""The more institutional clients you have, the more power you have [and] the more valuable you become,"" Carnegie Mellon's Singh said. ""That fight will happen in the next few years."" It's not clear whether Citi will revive Citi Coin or Wells Fargo (WFC) will launch Wells Coin in response to JPMorgan. Singh predicted that more banks would launch tokens of their own to get in the mix, and consolidation would happen down the line. ""Eventually, one platform will win,"" he said. Disrupting the disruptors It's not just major banks and financial services companies that need to tune in. JPM Coin also puts a spotlight on Ripple, a startup with its own crypto coin and payment network that uses blockchain technology.  Ripple has said it aims to dislodge the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or the Swift network. That's the system banks use to securely communicate with each other to facilitate global payments. CEO Brad Garlinghouse dismissed JPM Coin on Twitter. But questions about whether it's a threat could keep cropping up. Then there are the consortia that have allowed financial institutions to research blockchain applications together, such as R3, whose members include BNY Mellon (BK), State Street (STT) and BNP Paribas (BNPQY). Joining these platforms has served as a ""low-cost way to explore the tech without investing too much money,"" CB Insights' Levi said. Yet banks may choose to reemphasize higher-profile approaches now that JPMorgan has asserted itself. JPM Coin is still in its early stages, and its limits are a reminder that we're at the beginning of a sea change in how money is transferred around the world. But it certainly helps to create a stir. ""Nobody wants to be left behind,"" Levi said. "
33,33,Jamie Dimon hated bitcoin. Now JPMorgan is getting ahead of the crypto revolution,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/investing/jpmorgan-bitcoin-crypto-jamie-dimon/index.html,"Feb 15, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon famously bashed bitcoin as a ""fraud"" that global governments would ""crush."" Less than two years later, Dimon is pushing his company headfirst into the crypto space.  The bank is launching its very own digital coin. JPMorgan is the first major American bank to do so.  The debut of JPM Coin, which unlike bitcoin is equivalent to the US dollar, highlights the potential long-term threat blockchain poses to traditional financial players. The speed and security offered by blockchain makes the payment space ripe for dramatic disruption. ""JPMorgan and the other big banks have no choice but to go down this road,"" said Ed Yardeni, the former chief economist at Deutsche Bank who now leads Yardeni Research. ""If JPMorgan doesn't do it, someone else will."" Current system is 'slow and crappy' While Dimon publicly bashed bitcoin, his bank was quietly researching the promise of blockchain, the tamper-proof digital ledger that bitcoin is built on. ""We've always been supportive of blockchain. We've always believed it's a good technology,"" Umar Farooq, JPMorgan's head of digital treasury services and blockchain, told CNN Business on Thursday after the JPM Coin announcement.  Based on blockchain technology, JPMorgan (JPM) said its digital coin provides the ""instantaneous"" transfer of payments between institutional accounts.  That portends a major improvement from how money is currently shuttled through the financial system. ""It's universally taken as fact that the current system is really old, slow and crappy,"" Travis Kling, CEO of bitcoin hedge fund Ikigai Asset Management, told CNN Business.  Case in point: Kling said the fastest way to get $10,000 from LA to London is to put it in a briefcase and fly it.  ""That's incredibly ridiculous,"" he said.  Middle men face disruption It only makes sense that JPMorgan, the largest US bank by value and deposits, would try to improve that antiquated system. ""JPMorgan has an unparalleled blend of business acumen, technical experience, and scale to be able to not only envision the future of banking, but to will it into existence,"" Amber Baldet, JPMorgan's former head of blockchain, told CNN Business. It's important to note that the JPMorgan coin remains a prototype and will only be available to a select number of institutional customers at first.  Farook said that even several years down the line it's likely that JPM Coin will represent a ""pretty small portion"" of the $6 trillion in payments that JPMorgan moves around each day. Tom Serres, co-founder at Animal Ventures, said it was ""pretty much inevitable"" that JPMorgan would launch a coin.  ""Anyone who functions as a middle man validating and verifying transactions is at risk for disruption when it comes to blockchain,"" said Serres, whose firm invests in tech startups and crypto infrastructure. ""If you're not experimenting with this technology, then you're definitely losing out on huge opportunities."" One of the most alluring benefits of the blockchain is that it can reduce the speed and uncertainty that comes with traditional payments. That means transactions can be done more cheaply. Will more banks follow suit? And JPMorgan may just be the first of the major US players to jump into the space.  In December, Signature Bank (SBNY), a New York-based commercial lender, launched a digital payments platform based on blockchain. Major foreign lenders including HSBC (HBCYF) and Mitsubishi MUFG, are reportedly exploring crypto as well. ""It's a great step forward. I expect other institutions, including TD, will do things like this going forward,"" said Rick Burke, head of corporate products and services at TD Bank (TD). TD Bank released a survey last week that showed 90% of financial professionals believe blockchain and distributed ledger technology will have a positive impact on the payment industry. The top three impacts listed: stronger audit trails, speeding up the process and improving the efficiency of cross-border payments.  Don't confuse it with bitcoin Crypto insiders caution that the JPM Coin is very different than bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning its value isn't controlled by the Federal Reserve or any government authority. That makes bitcoin's worth subject to insane price swings. ""This is definitely not like that,"" said JPMorgan's Farooq. Unlike bitcoin, JPM Coin is always equal to one US dollar, backed by actual greenbacks held in designated accounts at JPMorgan. That makes it a centralized currency linked to the existing system.  JPM Coin ""needn't worry proponents of cryptcurrencies like bitcoin -- it's not the same thing,"" said Baldet, the former JPMorgan blockchain exec who is currently CEO of Clovyr, a company focused on data sharing. While major global governments might cast a wary eye on digital currencies they can't control, the JPM Coin isn't a threat to the current system. It's pegged to the world reserve currency and run by a company with deep ties to Washington and foreign capitals.  ""The government is more than happy to let a company like JPMorgan shuttle in with this replacement,"" said Kling, the crypto hedge fund CEO.  Nonetheless, the launch of a digital coin by the largest US bank is a major milestone in the crypto world. ""We are in the early stages"" of the blockchain revolution, said Farooq. ""It's still early days."" JPMorgan is clearly determined not to get left behind in that revolution.  "
34,34,JPMorgan is creating its own cryptocurrency,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/investing/jpmorgan-jpm-coin-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Feb 14, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, is launching its own cryptocurrency. Dubbed JPM Coin, the cryptocurrency has a fixed value redeemable for one US dollar. It won't trade freely like bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.  JPMorgan believes JPM Coin can help lower its clients' costs and risks, by making money transfers instantaneous and by reducing the amount of capital they need to hold onto. JPMorgan moves trillions of dollars around the world every day on behalf of customers. JPM Coin is designed to be used, at least initially, by major institutional customers, not individuals, although JPMorgan expects to roll it out to a broader range of customers later this year. JPMorgan (JPM) said it is the first American bank to create and successfully test this kind of digital coin. But Signature Bank (SBNY), a much smaller bank based in New York, started handling transactions for its business clients on its own blockchain platform on Jan. 1. Like the JPM Coin, its transactions are pegged to the dollar, and do not use a freely traded cryptocurrency like bitcoin. ""We understand they're a $2 trillion bank and we're a $47 billion bank,"" said Signature CEO Joseph DePaolo.  He said the use of blockchain technology by banks is likely to spread quickly. ""If you're not into blockchain technology as a bank, you won't be around in three to seven years,"" he said. CNBC first reported the existence of JPM Coin. Cryptocurrencies are not issued by governments. Their blockchain technology quickly transfers payments with a clear record of the transactions.  In 2017 JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon described bitcoin as a ""fraud,"" ""stupid"" and ""far too dangerous"" to people who traded it. Bitcoin, the best known cryptocurrency, has lost more than 80% of its value since its peak.  Dimon said that he supported blockchain technology for tracking payments, his company would fire anyone at the bank that traded in bitcoin ""in a second."" He soon after backed off of that harsh assessment, saying that he regretted his comments, adding that he believes cryptocurrencies are real and had to be examined individually.  The bank issued a further clarification Thursday on its position on cryptocurrencies. ""We have always believed in the potential of blockchain technology and we are supportive of cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated,"" said the bank ""As a globally regulated bank, we believe we have a unique opportunity to develop the capability in a responsible way with the oversight of our regulators.""

Some still see bitcoin as the ultimate hedge against disaster.   ""There is a really good chance we have something better than gold,"" Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund Ikigai Asset Management, said on Thursday at the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit in Grand Cayman.  ""It's like a CDS against fiscal and monetary policy irresponsibility,"" Kling said. Credit default swaps, or CDS, are akin to insurance policies. These financial instruments pay out when a borrower defaults on debt. CDS grew infamous during the 2008 crisis when AIG, one of the biggest issuers of CDS, nearly collapsed itself.  Like other crypto bulls, Kling is alarmed by the build-up of debt on government balance sheets and extreme steps taken by global central banks to encourage growth. Some fear that high budget deficits and low interest rates will eventually lead to hyper-inflation and erode the value of the US dollar and other major currencies.  ""That is how you would write the script"" for the ""mass adoption"" of a new kind of currency that isn't controlled by government authorities, he said.  Despite the collapse of bitcoin prices, Morgan Creek Capital Management is launching a crypto fund that will complete its fundraising on Friday.  The fund will focus in part on crypto infrastructure, the ""picks and shovels"" of the space, Morgan Creek founder and CEO Mark Yusko said.  ""We believe bitcoin will be one of, if not the, largest network on the planet,"" Yusko said. ""We are in the middle of the greatest wealth opportunity ... It's beyond any of our imaginations."" Morgan Creek is investing in a company that seeks to use blockchain to disrupt title insurers, which verify property transfers, Yusko said. Blockchain, the technology bitcoin is built on, is a tamper-proof digital ledger that records transactions without the need of a middleman.  ""Title insurance — it's just a stupid business. Why do we need to pay $1,000?"" Yusko asked. Day-trading crypto is dangerous Despite their enthusiasm, Crypto investors do acknowledge that the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies can be too extreme for the average person to trade. Countless retail investors lost money when they bought bitcoin near its high of nearly $20,000 in late 2017. Today, it trades at barely $3,000.  ""We're not day-traders. I have zero interest of picking up pennies in front of bulldozers,""  said Tom Serres, co-founder at Animal Ventures, a firm that invests in tech startups and the crypto infrastructure. Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said his firm is searching for investments in the infrastructure of cryptocurrencies. In 2012, Andreessen Horowitz backed CoinBase, the popular US crypto exchange. The company is now reportedly valued at about $8 billion.  Kupor stressed that cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy and will evolve tremendously over the coming years, creating opportunities along the way.  ""We are in the seed investment stage,"" Kupor said. ""The first iterations look silly. They never work ... The investment opportunities are the ones that solve the problems.""  "
36,36,A crypto exchange may have lost $145 million after its CEO suddenly died,http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/tech/quadriga-gerald-cotten-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Feb 5, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)The death of a Canadian entrepreneur has left a huge stash of cryptocurrencies locked off from the people who own them. Quadriga, Canada's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, said it's unable to gain access to $145 million of bitcoin and other digital assets after Gerald Cotten, its 30-year old CEO and co-founder, died of complications arising from Crohn's Disease while traveling in India. Many of the digital currencies held by Quadriga are stored offline in accounts known as ""cold wallets,"" a way of protecting them from hackers. Cotten is the only person with access to the wallets, according to the company.  The unusual case highlights the risks investors face looking after their assets in the thinly regulated industry.  Cotten's death has plunged Quadriga into crisis and left it struggling to figure out how to refund more than 100,000 of its users. On Tuesday, the company said it was granted creditor protection in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court as it tries to sort out its financial mess. ""For the past weeks, we have worked extensively to address our liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallets,"" Quadriga said in a statement on its website. ""Unfortunately, these efforts have not been successful.""  Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, said that the laptop that Cotten used to run the currency exchange is encrypted, according to a copy of her affidavit posted online by cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk. ""I do not know the password or recovery key,"" she said. ""Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere."" The company has hired tech experts in an attempt to hack into Cotten's laptop and other devices to retrieve the missing cryptocurrencies, but Robertson warned that at least some of them ""may be lost."" Quadriga, which is based in Vancouver, also owes about 70 million Canadian dollars ($53 million) in cash that it's unable to pay back, she said, citing difficulties accessing funds through the traditional banking system. The Nova Scotia court appointed financial services firm Ernst & Young as an independent monitor that will oversee Quadriga's efforts to resolve its financial problems. The Canadian High Commission in New Delhi told CNN that it was aware of Cotten's death and had ""provided consular assistance,"" but declined to reveal further details. While the case is unusual, it isn't the first time the cryptocurrency industry has been hit by security concerns. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of digital currencies have been stolen by hackers over the past few years.  The spectacular boom and bust in the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have presented a quandary for governments around the world, which have taken differing approaches in trying to regulate their use.

Nvidia expected sales of about $2.7 billion in the quarter but said Monday that it now predicts revenue will come in around $2.2 billion. The company also said its gross profit margin will be much lower than expected.  Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) plunged more than 16% in early trading on the news before rebounding a bit. Nvidia rival AMD (AMD) also fell nearly 5%. The broader market -- including tech stocks -- already fell sharply Monday morning after Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) reported earnings that missed forecasts by a wide margin. Caterpillar issued guidance that was below what Wall Street was expecting. Nvidia, which makes high-end graphics chips used for PC video games, self-driving cars and supercomputers, said demand for games in China was hurt by broader economic weakness.  The company added that sales of processors using its new Turing technology were lower than expected as consumers seem to be waiting for prices to drop. Nvidia will release its official results on February 14. Nvidia had been one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 in 2016 and 2017. But shares fell 30% last year because of growing worries about China's economy following a trade dispute with the United States.  Nvidia was also hit hard by the epic collapse in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' prices. Nvidia's powerful graphics chips have been used to mine bitcoin, solving complex mathematical problems needed to help produce cryptocurrencies. That market has dried up in the past year and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an earnings call in November that ""the crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected.""  "
39,39,Bitcoin used to draw a Davos crowd. Now it's a sideshow,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/business/bitcoin-crypto-davos/index.html,"Jan 23, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Davos, Switzerland (CNN Business)When the global business elite last gathered in Davos for their annual shindig, one bitcoin was worth $10,000. This year, a unit of the cryptocurrency buys just $3,560. Bitcoin, its alternatives and the technology that underpins them were a major talking point at last year's World Economic Forum. The collapse in value is reflected in a much lower profile this time around. The ""CRYPTO"" and ""BLOCKCHAIN"" signs that littered the Ski resort's promenade last year have all but disappeared, and bitcoin has virtually vanished from the official forum agenda. There was a line to get into last year's big panel debate on cryptocurrencies; there were plenty of empty seats on Wednesday. But the discussion was perhaps more mature. Elizabeth Rossiello, the founder of digital payments platform BitPesa, explained how the industry was evolving. She pointed to her company, which operates across Africa, as an example. BitPesa allows people to transfer funds by using bitcoin to move money across borders. ""We don't want to replace the local African currencies ... we want to make it easier to have African currency pairs,"" she said. Rossiello argued that digital currencies have shaken off their reputation as only being useful for hiring an ""assassin"" on the ""dark web."" She said that her company follows EU anti-money laundering ""know your client"" regulations. That means every customer has to provide their name, address, date of birth and source of funds. But this being Davos, there was also a skeptic on the panel. Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff, who has in the past likened bitcoin to a lottery ticket, said that digital currencies remain vulnerable to manipulation. ""If someone wants to do mischief, there seem to be ways to do it. And then who do you call? Oh, we decentralized it,"" he said. Rogoff, who is known for his work on financial bubbles, said the chance of cryptocurrencies taking over traditional money is ""zero."" But he acknowledged that he can see why bitcoin seems like a good solution for countries like Venezuela that are struggling with hyperinflation. The discussion ended with a vote on what's next for cryptocurrencies. Asked whether ""the whole thing is totally overhyped and quite dangerous,"" only one member of the audience raised a hand. That person? Gottfried Leibbrandt, CEO of the global international payments system Swift. "
40,40,The Carlos Ghosn case is putting Japan's system of 'hostage justice' under scrutiny,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/20/business/carlos-ghosn-japan-justice-system/index.html,"Jan 21, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Tokyo (CNN Business)In the blink of an eye, Carlos Ghosn's jet-setting world fell apart.  The 64-year-old auto executive's private jet landed in Tokyo on November 19, with Ghosn expecting a busy day of meetings at Nissan, the Japanese carmaker he saved from financial ruin. Instead, Ghosn walked right into the hands of Tokyo prosecutors who informed him he was under arrest on suspicion of financial crimes.  Two months later, at the time of year when he would typically be preparing to attend the annual gathering of the global elite in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, Ghosn is still in jail. He has been indicted on several charges, failed in repeated attempts to get bail and lost more than 20 pounds, according to his son.  The renowned business leader, who until recently presided over three of the world's biggest automakers, has undergone weeks of lengthy interrogations without a lawyer present while being cut off from his family. Ghosn has protested his innocence, but only after a lengthy public silence, which experts say is common for suspects in Japan who often face obstacles communicating with the outside world. His experience has brought heightened international attention to the way people suspected of crimes are treated in Japan.  ""That system of hostage justice, I think, does not bear scrutiny,"" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus. 'I wouldn't want this on anyone' If anyone has an idea of what Ghosn might be going through, it's Mark Karpeles. Like Ghosn, Karpeles is a French businessman in Japan who made a fortune, and then lost his freedom following accusations of financial misconduct. ""I wouldn't want this on anyone,"" Karpeles told CNN. ""Not my worst enemy, not even humanity's worst enemy."" Karpeles is the former owner and CEO of Mt. Gox, which at one point was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world. But it all came to an abrupt end in early 2014, when nearly $500 million disappeared. The missing money plunged Mt. Gox into bankruptcy and left behind some 30,000 angry investors.  Karpeles, 33, says hackers drained his company's virtual vaults, but Japanese police focused their investigation on him. He was arrested in 2015 and subsequently charged with embezzlement of around $3 million and breach of trust. The businessman kept detailed notes of his 11½ months in Japanese custody, which he describes as a ""nightmare."" He said that police interrogated him for 50-days straight without a single day off, and that he often considered pleading guilty, just to get the ordeal over with. ""It's very tempting when you are not free and facing a system that every morning tells you just cooperate and everything will be simple,"" he told CNN. ""To just go with the flow and say: okay, okay."" 'Punishment room' Karpeles said he lost 77 pounds in custody. After the interrogation period came seven months in solitary confinement at a pre-trial detention center in Tokyo. He remembers every detail of his windowless 6-square-meter (65-square-foot) cell, which had tatami floors, a sink, a toilet, and a small table on which he kept his journal. Karpeles said he was forced to sit upright in a corner for some ten hours a day. If guards caught him slouching or napping, they would shout through the door. Once, when he failed to comply, he was taken to the padded ""punishment room"" where his hands were tied behind his back and he was kept on the floor for several hours. He was released on bail more than two years ago, but he says he's still adjusting to life on the outside. As an accused criminal in Japan, finding an apartment and a job have proven to be a struggle. He now works as chief technology officer for an American company. Because he's not allowed to leave Japan as his case moves through the legal system, he hasn't been able to see his ailing mother in France for six years. Closing arguments in Karpeles' trial ended last month. The verdict is expected in March, nearly four years after his arrest. He continues to insist he's innocent. Ghosn's wife calls system 'draconian' Ghosn has also repeatedly professed his innocence. He has been fired from Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, and his days at the helm of Renault appear to be numbered.  In the two months since his surprise arrest, Ghosn has been held in pre-trial detention. Before his indictments, he was subjected to up to eight hours of daily interrogation without his attorneys present. He has been repeatedly denied bail on a growing list of charges, including understating some $80 million in income and aggravated breach of trust for briefly transferring his own investment losses to Nissan in 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis. In a court appearance this month, Ghosn denounced the allegations as unsubstantiated, saying he had been wrongly accused. Ghosn's own lawyer has acknowledged his client could be detained for as long as a year as he awaits trial. While Ghosn's resolve to defend himself has remained strong, according to his lawyer, he has found himself in a high-stakes game of legal poker with Tokyo prosecutors.  Critics say their goal appears to be to wear him down psychologically to the point where he signs a confession. Ghosn's wife, Carole, wrote a nine-page letter to the Tokyo branch of Human Rights Watch slamming the Japanese justice system as ""draconian."" ""No human being should be detained under conditions so harsh that their only plausible purpose is to coerce a confession,"" she wrote.  ""For hours each day, the prosecutors interrogate him, browbeat him, lecture him, and berate him, outside the presence of his attorneys, in an effort to extract a confession,"" she added. As he waits for trial, Ghosn is likely to face similar conditions to Karpeles: months of confinement with very limited access to other human beings. What's more, the odds are against him. Legal experts say more than 99% of people charged with a crime in Japan are eventually found guilty. Japanese lawyer: 'I think our system works very well' Those inside the Japanese legal system note that Ghosn is being treated just like any other suspect. ""All this criticism is based on misunderstanding, I think,"" said Shuji Yamaguchi, a partner at Tokyo-based law firm Okabe & Yamaguchi. ""Our system is quite modernized, however there are some people who believe differently."" The system keeps people safe, according to Yamaguchi, who points to Japan's low crime rates. ""I understand the criticism. But I want to say our system ... is supported by most Japanese people,"" he said. ""And still the crime rate is going down every year, so I think our system works very well."" Shin Kukimoto, a deputy public prosecutor in Tokyo, defended his office's handling of the Ghosn investigation at a news conference last week. ""We are the institution to execute the law and not the ones who design the legal system,"" he said. ""The investigation and interrogation are conducted appropriately in accordance with the law."" Prosecutors ""never conduct the investigation with certain goals in mind,"" Kukimoto said, insisting they wouldn't delay the legal process in order to ""prolong the detention to harass the suspects."" When asked about suspects' conditions in detention, Kukimoto said, ""We believe they are treated fairly."" Ghosn could face up to 15 years in prison if he's eventually found guilty on all charges. ""Every country has its own background, history and culture,"" Kukimoto, said at a news conference about Ghosn's case in November. ""I wonder if it is fair to criticize [Japan's justice system] because it is different from their own countries."" Yoko Wakatsuki and Daniel Shane contributed to this report."
41,41,How Zimbabwe became world's most expensive place to fuel a car,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/africa/zimbabwes-impoverished-billionaires-africa/index.html,"Jan 16, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)In the Fall of 2017, Zimbabweans took to the streets in mass protests against a regime that was presiding over a broken economy and collapsing living standards.  Those protests would turn to celebrations when President Robert Mugabe finally stepped down after 37 years in power. Mugabe's successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, was elected the following August on a promise to stabilize the economy and allow for greater democratic freedom. But the honeymoon has swiftly soured. The new administration is already facing major unrest with strikes and protests bringing Zimbabwe's two largest cities, Harare and Bulawayo, to a standstill.  Schools and government buildings were shuttered Monday, with streets standing empty, and sporadic violence being reported. Of course, the fall of Mugabe was not a panacea for one of the most famously unstable economies in the world, in which many citizens continue to face debilitating hardships. Almost a quarter of the population live in extreme poverty, according to the UN, and the cost of commodities are rising while salaries stagnate.  This wave of protests has served to emphasize the size of the task facing the new president. The spark The proximal cause for the unrest is Mnangagwa's announcement of massive fuel price hikes, with petrol rising from $1.24 to $3.31 a liter and diesel rising from $1.36 to $3.11 - making Zimbabwe the most expensive country in the world to fill a car.   The price hikes will also impact the price of many other commodities dependent on fuel, although Mnangagwa's announcement did also include measures to ""cushion"" government workers against rising costs of living. The president's announcement was the spur for the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) to launch a three-day ""stay away"" that effectively paralyzed many of the country's public services.  Transport and banking sectors have been among the worst-affected areas, with many teachers already on strike.  But the fuel crisis is just a symptom of a deeper malaise affecting the country.  As political analyst Derek Matyszak of the Institute for Security Studies puts it: ""This unrest was a slow train that has been coming for some time...and the fuel price hike was the straw that broke the camel's back."" Currency crisis The government's move to increase fuel prices represents part of a broader attempt to address a currency crisis that stems from 2009, and the decision to take the Zimbabwe dollar out of circulation after a period of disastrous hyperinflation that created a population of impoverished billionaires.  The US dollar became the primary currency, but a shortage of dollars led to the Mugabe government introducing a parallel system of 'bond notes' and electronic payments that are notionally equivalent to the dollar.  But in practice, the parallel currencies lost value against the dollar and currently trade at less than a third of the dollar's value on the black market. The devaluation of these currencies used to pay government salaries significantly increased the price of imports leading to rampant inflation and rocketing prices for consumer goods.  In November, inflation rates reached their highest level since 2009. The Economist recently reported that packs of nappies were selling for $49 in Harare. However, fuel prices are set by the government, which has maintained the official exchange rate so that consumers were paying less than a third of its dollar value.  'Billion dollar Ponzi scheme' This has meant that the government was effectively providing massive subsidies for fuel and running up an unsustainable deficit, which led to further borrowing and electronic money creation that further devalued the parallel currencies. Many Zimbabweans have grown disillusioned with these currencies and pursued alternatives, including cryptocurrencies. A surge of investment drove the price of Bitcoin above $10,000 in late 2017.  ""The government effectively created a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme that is now collapsing,"" says Matyszak.  ""There's no real cure for a Ponzi scheme other than a massive injection of cash - and nobody is willing to lend."" The government and new Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube have committed to a policy of consolidation intending to cutting the deficit, resolving foreign exchange shortages and curbing rampant inflation.  This has entailed pay restraint for public sector employees in addition to the new 150% rise in fuel prices - a critical factor in sparking this wave of unrest. Economist Brains Muchemwa, CEO of finance firm Oxlink Capital, believes such measures had become unavoidable. ""The major source of instability on the market has been the unsustainable budget deficit run up by imprudent borrowing by the central government as well as direct money creation,"" says Muchemwa.  ""The government is trying to put a stop to the fiscal excesses that have been part and parcel of our economy."" No easy solutions The current wave of protest across the country will test the government's resolve. But Muchemwa believes it is vital that Mnangagwa's administration stays the course. ""What is important is that the government sticks with the plan and manages the unrest as best they can while focusing on the bigger picture,"" the economist says.  ""Austerity does not happen without pain."" However, ZCTU-affiliated economist Godfrey Kanyenze has argued that the government has not been transparent about its retrenchment plans and must take steps to ease the strain on workers. ""Details were not shared with the public, and this has now created a situation where the public does not share the same vision with the executive,"" Kanyenze told online newspaper NewZimbabwe.com.  Back in Mugabe era?  Matyszak believes the government has no good options at this point. He believes that reinstating the primacy of the US dollar over parallel currencies, as the government has done with fuel, will reduce corruption and arbitrage in the economy.  'Dollarization' might also serve to win back the confidence of wary investors.  But this could also wipe ""billions of dollars"" of value off parallel currency holdings, while salaries and public services would also suffer.  The analyst adds that growing unrest could also lead to heavy-handed political repression. ""People might think 'we're back in the Mugabe era,'"" says Matyszak. "
42,42,Bitcoin is 10 years old. But it won't go mainstream until it's regulated,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/investing/bitcoin-prices/index.html,"Jan 14, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, just celebrated its tenth anniversary.  The digital currency has made plenty of strides toward legitimacy since it first launched, but it won't become a mainstream investment without the embrace of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC has yet to give the green light to any bitcoin projects. The agency has already rejected bitcoin ETF plans from Direxion, ProShares and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who became known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of the idea for Facebook.  Bitwise Asset Management filed last week with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund that would track bitcoin's performance. Another company, Wilshire Phoenix Funds, filed to sell shares of a fund that would own a mix of bitcoin, short-term Treasury bills and US dollars.  A decision about another proposed bitcoin ETF from mutual fund firm VanEck has been delayed. Because the shutdown is forcing the SEC to run with limited staff, that issue is not likely to be resolved until the government reopens.  The SEC did not respond to a request for comment. Matt Hougan, global head of research for Bitwise Asset Management, said he thinks the SEC is just being prudent and won't rush to give the thumbs up to ETFs for an asset class that's still evolving.  He noted the SEC took a similarly cautious approach to gold ETFs several years ago before approving many of them. The Winklevoss twins said in an interview this week that they agree with the SEC's cautious approach and will wait years for it to approve their ETF.   Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin present a lot of reason for caution.  Although the price of a single bitcoin (XBT) was once worth nearly $20,000 in December 2017, the value has fallen more than 80% since then to about $3,650. The currency is often compared unfavorably to the greatest financial panics in history.  ""Bitcoin is a speculative asset that's still in its infancy,"" said John Ryding, an economist and adviser at Moeda, which uses blockchain technology to help small businesses get loans. ""It can take quite a while for the market to shake out some of the excess. The good news is that bitcoin's been beaten up but it's still in the game."" Bitcoin optimists like Hougan think the worst is over. And there's evidence of mainstream acceptance.  In 2017, bitcoin futures launched on both the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the mutual fund giant Fidelity also established a trading platform for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies late last year.   Noted bitcoin bear Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital sounds positive, too. He recently told investors he thinks bitcoin prices could rally later this year and get back to about $5,000. That's nowhere near the currency's high, but it still is about a 35% gain from current levels. Stable trading could help convince the SEC that the time is right to change its tune.  Others aren't so sure that bitcoin's on the rebound.  ""We have not seen the bottom in bitcoin,"" wrote Marin Katusa, head of Katusa Research in a recent report. ""The dot-com bubble of the late '90s played out exactly the same way. Hundreds of companies rode the soaring wave of investor sentiment in order to cash in on the hysteria. Hysteria can only support valuations for so long, and eventually fundamentals take over."" Hysteria often gives way to fear as well. The dramatic drop might have scared off some investors forever.  Hougan conceded that there needs to be a big shakeout in the cryptocurrency market for bitcoin to rebound. There are simply too many digital coins out there, and bitcoin still has the dominant market share.  ""Most cryptocurrencies are garbage and will be discarded into the dustbin of history,"" Hougan said. ""The sooner the better."" "
43,43,12 arrested in kidnapping of US businessman in Costa Rica,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/13/americas/12-arrested-in-costa-rican-kidnapping-scheme/index.html,"Jan 13, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Twelve people have been arrested in Costa Rica and Spain in connection with the suspected kidnapping of an American businessman, authorities said.  William Sean Creighton Kopko, the owner of 5Dimes, an online gambling platform, was kidnapped on September 24 in Costa Rica, according to a statement issued by the Spanish Civil Guard on Saturday. Kopko's family agreed to pay the Bitcoin equivalent of $950,800 in ransom after his kidnappers made several calls threatening to kill him, according to the statement.  But after a payment was made, the kidnappers stopped communicating with Kopko's family and he is still missing.  Suspects traveled to Cuba After the kidnapping members of the gang fled to Cuba, the Civil Guard statement said. On November 9, Costa Rica informed the Civil Guard that three suspects had left Cuba and entered Spain through the Madrid-Barajas airport. The suspects who traveled to Spain were arrested after they rented a house in the city of Zaragoza, according to the news release. Video from Costa Rican investigators shows authorities raiding a house on Friday in Costa Rica. That raid led to the arrest of nine others allegedly involved in the kidnapping scheme.  The US State Department has not posted any travel advisories regarding Costa Rica, but there is a warning on its website that crime ""is increasing in Costa Rica and U.S. citizens are frequent victims."" American Carla Stefaniak was found dead after she went missing in Costa Rica in November. A security guard at the Airbnb where Stefaniak was staying was arrested and is a suspect in her killing.

44,44,Investors turn to gold as stocks get whipped around,http://www.cnn.com/2019/01/08/investing/gold-stocks-market-volatility/index.html,"Jan 8, 2019","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)The turbulent stock market has thrilled gold investors. The price of gold has gained more than 8% since the beginning of October. The S&P 500 has plunged 14% during the same time frame. And investors who've bought gold mining stocks have done even better than those who just own the precious metal. Newmont (NEM), a gold miner whose stock is in the S&P 500, has soared more than 13% since October. And Barrick Gold (ABX), which merged with Randgold last year to create the world's largest gold miner, is up nearly 20%.  Why has gold been so hot? Gold performs well when investors are nervous, as they clearly are right now.  Stocks have made a nice comeback in 2019 on reports of progress in US-China trade talks and recent hopes that the Federal Reserve may slow down its pace of rate hikes this year. But investors are still worried: The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index, a measure of market sentiment, has shown signs of Extreme Fear in the market for the past month. ""Fears over an economic slowdown and trade conflicts loom large. US stocks in December posted their worst month since February 2009, while perceived 'safe havens' such as gold, the Japanese yen and US government bonds garnered more interest,"" said BlackRock global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill in a report this week.  The global political turmoil isn't going away overnight either. And that also should be good for gold. ""In a world where the inward looking nationalist urge appears to be spreading globally, where not just the Fed, but the ECB (and others) have exploded their balance sheet and where global relationships ... are being redrawn by the minute, perhaps there will be a place for gold in 2019,"" wrote market analysts at research firm BTIG. A new gold rush? Investors put nearly $5 billion into gold and precious metal funds in the fourth quarter of last year — a time when the stock market was in freefall mode — according to EPFR Global, a firm that tracks mutual fund data. By way of comparison, investors took out about $60 billion from US stock mutual funds during that time frame. Recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve helped fuel the gold rally, too. Investors flocked to gold due to worries that higher rates will eventually slow down the economy, even though the Fed is touting the hikes as a sign of the economy's strength. ""The interest in gold is one of several signals that investors see the cost of higher US interest rates starting to outweigh any benefits,"" analysts at EPFR Global wrote. But what about those recent comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell? His remark last week that the Fed would likely be more ""patient"" with regards to future rate hikes helped fuel a monstrous stock market rally Friday. If the Fed pauses with its rate increases and that stabilizes Wall Street, will that lead to a big pullback in gold? Not necessarily.  Long-term bond yields have been falling lately, noted Simona Gambarini, a markets economist with Capital Economics, in a report this week. The US 10-Year Treasury bond now has a yield of about 2.7% -- down from a high of nearly 3.25% last October. This sharp drop in long-term bond yields should be good for gold because conservative investors tend to favor fixed income assets over gold when they can expect a big payoff down the road from the interest on the bonds. So if yields continue to fall, gold looks more attractive. Gold may also be a safer bet than the casino that is bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Yes, gold is not something that any investor should go overboard with and make a big portion of their portfolio. But it might be a better investment than people think, including Warren Buffett, who famously referred to it as a cube that just sits there and does nothing. "
45,45,Authorities search for sender of global email bomb threats,http://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/us/email-bomb-threats-search/index.html,"Dec 14, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Authorities across four countries are trying to learn who sent dozens of email bomb threats Thursday afternoon, causing anxiety and business disruptions but no reported violence. Threats were reported across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Universities, courthouses and newspapers received them. It was unknown if the threats were identical. Local police in dozens of cities and counties got involved. So did the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Recipients were reported to have received an email saying that there was a hidden bomb that would detonate unless the sender received a bitcoin ransom. It's unclear whether everyone who got a threat Thursday received the same email.  An email demanding $20,000 via bitcoin was forwarded Thursday to CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City by a viewer who received it at her business.  The message was identical to an email warning posted on social media by the police department in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and it was similar to descriptions of other threats posted on social media nationwide. The Cedar Rapids Police Department ""has found NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE that these emails are authentic. It appears to be a robo-email that has been sent throughout the area hoping to scam businesses out of money. We have also received information that businesses in surrounding counties may have also received this email,"" the agency posted.  CNN is not disclosing the name of the sender or specifics of the bitcoin account. Similar threats were sent earlier It is unclear whether Thursday's threats could be related to a series of hoax bomb threats sent since late August via an online messaging service to recipients in multiple states. CNN has learned that over more than three months, academic institutions, federal and state law enforcement agencies, gun stores, and municipal offices in more than a dozen states received threatening emails deemed hoaxes by law enforcement authorities.   In a warning reviewed by CNN, the FBI recently shared information with law enforcement authorities nationally about the prior emails sent through an email service called ""Guerilla Mail"" that masks the identities of senders. The bulletin indicated the FBI has not identified any real or hoax devices at the threatened locations, suggesting law enforcement deemed at least some of the threats credible enough to conduct searches. Threats at universities, media, courthouse Some threats Thursday led to school lockdowns or disrupted business and other activities. In the Iowa city of Des Moines, hundreds of children were evacuated from the Science Center of Iowa on Thursday afternoon because of a threat there, CNN affiliate KCCI reported. ""Whenever something like this happens, we have to treat it like it's real,"" the center's Emilee Richardson told KCCI. In Oklahoma City, accountant Douglas Holsted told CNN affiliate KOKH he called police when his office received an email threat. He, like others, said the email demanded $20,000 in bitcoin by the end of the day. Police searched but found nothing in the building. ""I've never seen (an email) that said, 'I planted a bomb in your building, I'm going to blow it up if you don't pay me.' That part surprised me,"" Holsted said. In Seattle, the University of Washington noted in a campuswide alert that the FBI had ""advised that the email is not a credible threat."" The university concluded sweeps of buildings that might have been affected. The Thurston County Courthouse in Olympia, Washington, and the Park Record newspaper in Park City, Utah, also received similarly threatening emails. People were evacuated but eventually were allowed back inside, according to tweets on verified Twitter accounts. In California, the Riverside Sheriff's Office had ""an influx of email threats"" and is taking them seriously, although no threat has been substantiated. The San Francisco Police Department responded to reports of bomb threats at locations throughout the city. ""We have received information that several other cities across the United States have received similar threats,"" police said.  Pennsylvania State Police are ""investigating some bomb threats in the eastern part of the state,"" a department spokesman fold CNN. ""Penn State University Police, in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating a message received by individuals in multiple locations on campus and across the state,"" the university said in a statement. ""Police say this does not appear to be a legitimate threat, however, an investigation is ongoing."" University police later said the threat appears to be a hoax. The Chicago Police Department by Thursday afternoon was investigating threats at 36 locations, with ""no reports of any injured people, any suspicious objects or any evacuations,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted.  ""#ChicagoPolice are working with federal partners on the investigation, and at this time there is no elevated threat level for the city of Chicago,"" he tweeted.  The New York Police Department's counterterrorism bureau tweeted that bomb threats sent electronically to various locations in New York City and various places nationwide ""are NOT considered credible at this time."" Threats were also emailed to the Charlotte News & Observer and the Raleigh News & Observer newspapers in North Carolina.  Dozens more threats continued to come in across the country later into the day, authorities reported. Threats spanning 4 countries The FBI has acknowledged threats across Canada, with multiple emails in Vancouver, Ottawa and Toronto. ""We encourage Canadians to follow the direction of local law enforcement and to report anything suspicious to them,"" said Scott Bardsley, senior advisor for communications for the Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. ""Swatting incidents are serious crimes and will be investigated by police."" New Zealand authorities are aware of three similar incidents of threatening emails demanding ransoms of bitcoin, according to a New Zealand police spokesperson.  And the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has alerted a ""widespread bomb threat email campaign.""  ""Under no circumstances should individuals respond to such emails, or transfer any money or bitcoins,"" an ACSC spokesperson said. ""As a precaution, state policing agencies are treating these emails as a legitimate threat until confirmed otherwise. If individuals receive the email, we encourage them to report the matter to their local police service."" Authorities are remaining vigilant Although the threats are not believed to be credible, law enforcement is still watching the matter closely.  Colorado's State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) activated at level 3 operations, indicating that the situation requires ""requires enhanced monitoring and coordination,"" according to the agency. The SEOC said the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force is the lead agency in the joint effort. The FBI is reporting that the emails have appeared in more than 25 states, according to the SEOC's statement. And in San Francisco, Officer Michael Andraychak told reporters that all threats are being investigated and bomb-sniffing dogs have been utilized. ""We take all threats of bombs and destructive devices very, very seriously and investigate them thoroughly,"" Andraychak said. Nearly 20 emails were sent to businesses across the city, Andraychak said, and the Jewish Community Center self-evacuated in response to threats on its block. ""As always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activities which could represent a threat to public safety,"" the FBI said. CNN's Jason Hanna, Jeremy Grisham and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report."
47,47,Veteran investor says there's more to tech than FAANG,http://www.cnn.com/2018/12/11/investing/tech-stocks-kevin-landis-firsthand/index.html,"Dec 11, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Kevin Landis has been running the tech-focused Firsthand Funds since 1994, so he's got some perspective on ups and downs in Silicon Valley, including recent volatility fueled by US-China trade tensions. Landis spoke with CNN Business about the tech sector's recent dive and said he understands why investors are nervous. Recent headlines about China banning many of Apple's iPhones and Canada holding the chief financial officer of telecom networking company Huawei for extradition to the United States have only made matters worse. ""This is the economic equivalent of a fly-by shooting,"" he said. ""It feels like investors are already hiding underneath their desks."" But Landis said he's cautiously optimistic that those tensions will soon end. He said the current trade war amounts to saber rattling.  Despite tech's rocky 2018, the sector may ultimately be a good long-term investment. Tech companies remain among the most powerful and wealthiest in the world. One year of volatility won't change that. Landis' optimism extends to the market, too. He said that the sizable sell-off for the Nasdaq, which is now down nearly 15% from the record high it set earlier this year, has created some notable opportunities for those brave enough to dive in to tech.  In fact, his firm's Firsthand Technology Value (SVVC) closed-end fund (a mutual fund that trades like a stock) has thrived, even in the midst of this tech turmoil. The fund is up nearly 40% this year. Nvidia: A fallen angel that finally looks like a bargain The fund recently took a stake in chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), the graphics processor that has plunged more than 45% from its all-time high. Landis said Nvidia has been on his radar for awhile but the stock always seemed too expensive. Nvidia has gotten hit by the crash in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Its chips are used for so-called crypto mining -— the graphics-heavy process needed to discover and obtain bitcoins.  Landis thinks there is more to Nvidia than bitcoin. And since the crypto bubble appears to have burst, the stock finally looks attractive. Nvidia is arguably the most well-known tech that he's bought recently, though.  Landis said investors need to resist the herd mentality and look beyond the five techs that get the lion's share of attention -— the so-called FAANG stocks of Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL). He said the most recent sell-off is a ""lesson on what happens when everyone owns the same stocks."" Landis said his funds underweight Apple, Amazon and Google because the big spending sprees by some of those companies make him nervous. He does not own Microsoft (MSFT), either, despite its cloud resurgence under CEO Satya Nadella.  ""Old companies with big market caps scare me,"" he said. ""When companies have to buy their growth, there is usually something missing."" Look beyond FAANG for values in tech Landis does like streaming device maker Roku (ROKU), which he says is ""on the right side of the cable cord cutting trend,"" along with education tech company Chegg (CHGG), networking equipment maker Arista (ANET) and data protection service Nutanix (NTNX).  He's not afraid to look overseas for holdings either. Among his top holdings are semiconductor equipment companies Pivotal Systems and Revasum, which both recently went public on the Australia Securities Exchange.  Landis said that to find long-term tech winners, it makes more sense to look for smaller innovative companies.  But Landis isn't completely ignoring the FAANG stocks. He said he's still a big fan of Facebook — warts and all -— because of its strong growth potential.  Netflix still looks unstoppable  And Landis has been a long-term bull on Netflix. He said he's owned the stock since 2004 and that he continues to believe that it will fend off competition, even as media giants like Disney (DIS) look to get bigger in streaming content.  Landis quipped that there have always been Netflix doubters, going back to the days when it was just a DVD mail service that investors thought would be killed by the likes of Blockbuster, Redbox and even retail giant Walmart  (WMT). ""Netflix is beyond critical mass,"" Landis said, referring to its more than 137 million subscribers and billions of dollars spent annually on programming. ""There's an entire short seller's graveyard for investors who have bet against it."" "
48,48,Bitcoin's epic plunge continues,http://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/investing/bitcoin-prices-plunging/index.html,"Dec 7, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)What a difference a year makes for bitcoin.  In December 2017, bitcoin prices hit a record high of just under $20,000. Flash forward to December 2018 and bitcoin is now trading a little below $3,400. That's a more than 80% plunge. Bitcoin is at a 15-month low. But prices have really gotten whacked this week, falling nearly 20% in just the past five days alone.  Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency getting hit either. Ripple/XRP, ethereum, stellar, litecoin and numerous other cryptocurrencies have plunged in the past week.  Little tangible news can explain or justify the current crypto carnage.  One possible reason is that a pro-crypto member of the Securities and Exchange Commission warned at a conference this week that she's fighting an uphill battle trying to convince the rest of the SEC to approve more bitcoin exchange traded funds.  ""Don't hold your breath. I do caution people to not live or die on when a crypto or bitcoin ETF gets approved,"" said SEC commissioner Hester Peirce. That's not a good sign. Peirce's comments probably mean hopes for a bitcoin ETF getting approved anytime soon have been dashed, according to long-term bitcoin bull Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with Think Markets UK Ltd. Aslam argued that bitcoin prices could wind up plummeting below $2,000 and even test the $1,500 level. ""Simply put, the bad news keeps coming just like cockroaches coming out of a hole,"" Aslam wrote in a report.  More downside could be ahead simply because the price of bitcoin and many other digital currencies just ran up so sharply last year. It was a parabolic move that defied reason, similar to internet stocks in the late 1990s -- a classic mania.  Nearly two-thirds of money managers surveyed by asset management firm Natixis still thought that cryptocurrencies were a bubble, the firm reported this week. "
49,49,The Great Oil Crash of 2018: What's really happening,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/investing/oil-prices-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html,"Nov 21, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)The meltdown in the oil market has caught almost everyone off guard. In the span of mere weeks, crude prices went from a four-year high to a full-blown bear market. The oil crash -- crude is down more than 30% from its recent peak -- was triggered by a series of factors that combined to spook traders who once saw $100 oil on the horizon.  ""The sheer scale of the move is triggering unpleasant memories of 2014 and 2015,"" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets, alluding to the last oil downturn.  US oil prices briefly dropped below $50 a barrel on Thursday for the first time in more than a year.  President Donald Trump celebrated the oil crash. ""Oil prices getting lower, Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy!"" Trump tweeted last week. ""Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!"" But the oil slide can't be explained by a simple tweet.  Iran headfake Saudi Arabia deserves some of the ""credit"" -- but certainly not all of it.  Earlier this year, the Trump administration vowed to zero out Iranian oil exports. That tough stance on Iran sanctions lifted prices dramatically.  Under pressure from Trump, Saudi Arabia ramped up production to an all-time high. That's critical because Saudi Arabia is like the central bank of oil. It's the world's largest exporter and the only country with the ability to significantly ramp up output. Russia and the United States also accelerated production. But the Trump administration shocked the oil market earlier this month by taking a softer approach on Iran. Temporary waivers were granted, allowing India, China and other countries to keep buying crude from Iran.  The Iran headfake left the oil market suddenly facing a potential supply glut. OPEC is now under pressure to significantly cut output at next month's meeting in Vienna to help put a floor beneath the market. American shale oil boom Although Trump praised Saudi Arabia, his tweet omitted the central role played by America in the oil plunge. Lifted by the shale oil boom, the United States recently overtook Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's largest oil producer for the first time since 1973.   The International Energy Agency predicts US output will have soared by more than 2 million barrels per day in 2018. It's expected to climb further next year. No other country has ramped up production to that degree. The fear among oil traders is that the world may not need all that American shale coming to market. That's what helped cause the last oil crash. US inventory levels have increased nine straight weeks, according to numbers released on Wednesday.  Demand fears But this oil downturn isn't solely about excess supply. The slowdown in global economic growth appears to already be denting demand.  Appetite for oil in the United States has been ""very robust,"" but the IEA recently warned of ""relatively weak"" demand in Europe and developed Asian countries. And the IEA flagged a ""slowdown"" in demand in India, Brazil and Argentina caused by high prices, weak currencies and deteriorating economic activity.  Last month the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 GDP estimates for both China and the United States because of the trade war. Global GDP is expected to slow from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.5% next year. That's never good news for oil, which powers the economy. Stock market mayhem Crude has also gotten caught in the shoot-first, ask-questions-later mood on Wall Street. Fears of a slowdown have led investors to flee risky assets, no matter if it's Apple (AAPL) stock, bitcoin or crude oil. Crude oil plunged 7% Tuesday, as the Dow tumbled 552 points.  The oil collapse in part reflects the ""broader cross-commodity and cross-asset sell-off as growth concerns continue to mount,"" Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients on Tuesday. Courvalin argued that the oil selloff has ""overshot"" the fundamentals. However, he predicted oil won't recover until OPEC takes action and there's evidence that demand growth is ""resilient."" Fast money Commodities, much like stocks, are influenced by large bets made by hedge funds and other traders. Analysts say the oil plunge was exacerbated by the unwinding of massive bullish bets by financial players.  The managed money community's long positions in crude plunged in late October to the lowest level since early 2016 when crude crashed to $26 a barrel, according to RBC.  Gasoline keeps getting cheaper The pre-Thanksgiving Day oil crash made traveling cheaper for millions of Americans. The national average price of gasoline dropped to $2.51 a gallon on Thursday, down from $2.81 a month ago, according to AAA.  That could provide an extra boost to the economy this holiday shopping season.  Of course, the sharp decline in oil also clouds the outlook for America's oil industry. The last downturn in energy sparked dozens of bankruptcies and wiped out hundreds of thousands of America's oil jobs in states like Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.  ""Retail gasoline prices have come off significantly. What more does Trump want?"" said RBC's Tran. ""At some point you start to hurt your own domestic producers. And a significant portion of the oil and gas industry is his base support."" "
50,50,Justice Dept. announces indictment of two Iranians in ransomware scheme,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/doj-indictment-iran-ransomware/index.html,"Nov 28, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)Two Iranian men have been indicted for their alleged involvement in a hacking and malware scheme that spanned more than two years and crippled computer systems at hospitals and municipal offices across the country, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday.  Faramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, allegedly released a type of ransomware called ""SamSam"" designed to hold computer systems hostage -- forcing victims to pay ""ransom"" to re-gain access, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a news conference on Wednesday.  ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today -- the first of its kind -- outline an Iran-based international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in 21st-century digital blackmail,"" said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski.  The duo allegedly acted inside Iran and collected over $6 million from more than 200 victims, causing more than $30 million in losses during a 34-month span. Among their alleged targets was the city of Atlanta, where segments of the municipal online infrastructure were ground to a halt for days in March because of the malware infection, disabling residents from paying water bills and forcing police officers to file reports by hand.   Other victims of the attack included the city of Newark, New Jersey, MedStar Health and the Colorado Department of Transportation, among others, according to Benczkowski, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. On Wednesday, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said the attacks ""seriously compromised"" their networks and ""disrupted vital services that we provide to residents."" ""The hackers asked for payment of the bitcoin equivalent of $30,000 in ransom and we paid that as recommended by law enforcement officials in order to prevent long-term disruption,"" Baraka said in a statement.  He added, ""Both the FBI and Department of Justice were extremely helpful in guiding us every step of the way and assisting in a situation we had never faced before.""  The indictment does not allege that the men had any official connection to the Iranian government, according to Benczkowski. The Justice Department plans to file notices with Interpol to restrict the men's travel, Benczkowski said. Benczkowski said Savandi and Mansouri face charges of ""conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and, transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.""  In a related move, the US Treasury Department on Wednesday also announced it was taking action against two others based in Iran, Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan.  According to the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan allegedly assisted Savandi and Mansouri convert the cryptocurrency Bitcoin into Iranian rial.  ""Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyberactors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims,"" said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker in a statement. ""As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to US dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes.""  Despite common conception that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, they are pseudonymous -- meaning there is a way to trace the transactions.  ""The criminals believe they were masking their identities on the dark web, however this case shows that anonymizers may not make you as anonymous as you think you are. They use Bitcoin to avoid detection but this case shows that digital currency may be traceable,"" said FBI Executive Assistant Director Amy S. Hess, the law enforcement agency's top cyberofficial.  CrowdStrike CSO and former FBI executive assistant director Shawn Henry tells CNN that these types of indictments are examples of targeted operations where the FBI, NSA and CIA are teaming up like never before to go after hackers. In the statement, Mandelker also said they are publishing addresses linked to ""illicit actors.""  ""We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space. Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies and weaknesses in cyber and AML/CFT safeguards to further their nefarious objectives."" Rosenstein on Wednesday called the cyberattacks a ""high-tech, sophisticated extortion plot."" ""These defendants are now fugitives from American justice. American justice has a long arm and we will wait and eventually we're confident that we will take these perpetrators into custody,"" Rosenstein said.   CNN's Jose Pagliery and Ahiza Garcia contributed to this report. "

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Russia investigation Paul Manafort violated his plea agreement with the Justice Department by lying to the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's office two months after he started cooperating in the Russia probe, prosecutors said in a stunning court filing. So, the deal that Manafort, the one-time chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, had is now ""breached,"" and both sides now request that Manafort's case move to sentencing. Manafort, in the court filing, says he doesn't agree with prosecutors' claim that he lied. So, what is he accused of being untruthful about? Prosecutors say Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters,"" and Mueller's office says it will provide details at a later date. 2. General Motors The shockwaves are reverberating from Detroit to Washington after GM announced it will shut down five North American factories and cut 15% of its salaried workers. This major restructuring of the company means GM will stop making sedans the car-buying public no longer wants -- like the Chevrolet Volt, Impala and Cruze and the Buick LaCrosse -- and focus on SUVs, hatchbacks, crossovers and trucks. The carmaker, which saw decent earnings last quarter, is also making a big bet on new technologies, as it eyes Silicon Valley's push into self-driving cars. The moves will save GM $6 billion a year by the end of 2020. But this will also cost 8,000 salaried workers their jobs. About 6,000 hourly workers will either lose their jobs or be reassigned to other plants. 3. Midterm elections Yes, the midterms are still going on, but they're almost over. The last US Senate race -- the racially charged runoff between GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi -- is today. Hyde-Smith has been dogged by questions about just what exactly she meant by that ""public hanging"" comment from a few weeks ago. That's made this race close, but the consensus is that she'll pull it out, since Mississippi is the reddest of red states and President Trump campaigned for her yesterday at two rallies. Meanwhile, Democrats are still picking up seats in the House. Their net gain is now 38 seats, after Republican Mia Love conceded her race in Utah. That leaves just two races to be called, and the Democratic candidates lead in both. 4. Facebook Later this morning in London, documents Facebook had hoped to keep secret might be revealed during an ""International Grand Committee"" on disinformation and ""fake news."" Representatives from the United Kingdom, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Latvia and Singapore will be there. Facebook's just sending a VP and not CEO Mark Zuckerberg. CNN's Hadas Gold and Donie O'Sullivan detail how UK lawmakers ended up with the documents and what might be done with them. 5. Mars lander After seven months in space -- and ""seven minutes of terror"" -- NASA's InSight lander touched down on Mars. InSight will spend two years studying Mars' interior, where the building blocks below the planet's surface recorded its history. The landing was watched around the world, and the folks back at mission control celebrated with the coolest handshake in scientific history. The terrifying seven minutes was how long it took InSight to set itself down on the Red Planet. During the tricky maneuver, InSight slowed from 12,300 mph to 5 mph before it gently landed on the surface.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Word of the year The word ""misinformation"" has been around since the late 1500s, but it seems like it was tailor-made for 2018.

52,52,Woman admits to laundering stolen money to support ISIS,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/zoobia-shahnaz-new-york-isis/index.html,"Nov 26, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)A New York woman has pleaded guilty to providing material support for ISIS, admitting to laundering stolen money to support the terrorist group, the Justice Department announced Monday.  The announcement said Zoobia Shahnaz falsely obtained a loan, fraudulently secured more than a dozen credit cards and purchased Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of her efforts to back the group. ""She then engaged in a pattern of financial activity, culminating in several wire transactions totaling over $150,000 to individuals and shell entities in Pakistan, China and Turkey that were fronts for ISIS,"" the department said.  Shahnaz was indicted last year and stood accused of bank fraud, money laundering and support of ISIS, according to court documents.  At the time of her indictment, authorities said Shahnaz had tried to leave the US for Syria after ""consummating the scheme"" but ultimately was arrested  The Justice Department said in Monday's announcement that she faces up to 20 years in prison following the guilty plea.  Steve Zissou, an attorney for Shahnaz, told CNN following the guilty plea that the case should serve as a warning for people to prioritize ""the real threat"" of radicalization over issues like a caravan of migrants headed for the US. ""The warning here is for people to stop paying attention to the caravan and to focus on the real threat ... the growing number of American citizens who have been seduced by this imaginary caliphate in the Middle East,"" Zissou said, adding, ""The folks in Washington -- the President has really got to get his eye on the ball."" The announcement said that while she worked to provide material support for ISIS, Shahnaz viewed ISIS propaganda online and searched ""for information that would facilitate her entry into Syria"" before she was intercepted at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York last year. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report."
53,53,Ohio becomes  the first state to allow businesses to pay taxes with Bitcoin,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/us/ohio-business-pay-taxes-with-bitcoin-trnd/index.html,"Nov 26, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)As the value of Bitcoin continues to drop, Ohio becomes the first US state to accept the cryptocurrency in paying taxes.  Starting this week, many businesses in the state will be able to make tax payments on a variety of sales, as well as employee withholding and public utility taxes with Bitcoin.  ""We are proud to make Ohio the first state in the nation to accept tax payments via cryptocurrency,"" said Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel in a press release.  ""We're doing this to provide Ohioans more options and ease in paying their taxes and also to project Ohio's leadership in embracing blockchain technology."" Companies interested in using the new system will have to register with the state's Treasurer's office through OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will take each payment and convert the virtual currency to actual dollars before being deposited into a state account, the press release said.  The state will use BitPay, a cryptocurrency global payment system, to complete the process.  BitPay will keep the Treasurer's office from holding or using Bitcoins, and it will allow blockchain technology to create more transparency in transactions.  The system will reduce risk and identity fraud, and let payments be made quickly from anywhere, said Stephen Pair, BitPay co-founder and CEO. Any business that operates in Ohio -- even if not based there -- will be able to use the portal to pay up to 23 taxes, including those on cigarettes and tobacco products, with a small feel to confirm transaction.   In 2014, the state launched OhioCheckbook.com to share spending information. In the new portal, anyone in the blockchain network will be able to view all the transactions made, the press release said. For now, taxpayers will be able to use only Bitcoin, but the Treasurer's office said it might allow other cryptocurrencies later. It still will accept checks, money orders, credit and debit cards.    The price of Bitcoin slipped below $4,000 on Sunday. The state addressed cryptocurrency's volatility on the new portal.   ""BitPay sets the exchange rate for a 15 minute allotted time window for each transaction once a business taxpayer begins to make their payment at OhioCrypto.com,"" the site states.

In fact, about 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have emerged since the creation of bitcoin in 2009. And they fall into buckets like stable coins and tokens.  Coupled with the lack of clear regulations or oversight and how new the space is, it's enough to leave any crypto newcomer completely confused. Crypto is valued by investors because it's not regulated by any central figure. It's also exchanged pseudonymously, which allows for greater privacy.  While it was originally used for illicit transactions, it's gained wider adoption. Even companies like Overstock and Starbucks have started experimenting with how to let customers use it to shop. Investing in crypto is still risky and volatile -- let's recall bitcoin's infamous rise in value to $20,000 late last year and its current price of under $5,000.  Because of this, knowing the core differences is worth your time.  Coins vs. Tokens First, you'll want to know the difference between coins and tokens. Coins are essentially virtual cash used for many types of transactions. They're bought and sold over numerous different crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, bitbuy.ca and Binance. The first recorded bitcoin transaction was for two pizzas.  Tokens represent assets or anything that has value ascribed to it. For example, tokens can be used to represent things like the ownership of a piece of art or the number of rewards points a customer has in a company's loyalty program. They both have value and rely on blockchain technology, a digital ledger of transactions that can't be erased. But a coin is virtual money and a token is not. Bitcoin and Alt Coins Bitcoin was the original form of cryptocurrency -- and it's the coin others are compared to. ""Bitcoin is the mother crypto,"" said Marshall Hayner, founder of Metal Pay, an app that's much like Venmo for crypto. Not surprisingly, its emergence sparked the rise of copycats, including alternative coins like litecoin, XRP and ether. Ether is used to power its own unique blockchain called Ethereum -- one of the biggest creators of smart contracts. These contracts use cryptographic code to verify and trigger transactions when certain conditions are met. For example, a smart contract could be set to pay out a certain amount of crypto at 1:00 p.m. on a specific day.  Another bitcoin alternative is XRP, which was built to make it easier for banks and payment processors to make cross-border payments. It's one of the most popular cryptocurrencies.  There are also obscure alternatives, like dogecoin, which was created as a joke based on a viral meme of a Shiba Inu. The dog's face is displayed on the front of the virtual coin. The currency is commonly used on social media to tip users who post interesting things. Dogecoin has helped many people learn about and dabble in trading cryptocurrencies because its community tends to not take itself too seriously and is very friendly to new investors. Stable Coins Stable coins are pegged to actual currencies like the US dollar, the euro or the British pound. That means that one dollar or pound gets you one crypto coin. These coins are designed to mimic actual currencies and tend to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies.  Tether was one of the first stable coins.  ""The idea behind tether is you give a dollar and you get one tether,"" Hayner said. But there's still risk, according to Ryan Taylor, CEO of the cryptocurrency Dash. Their value can erode over time similar to fiat currencies like the US dollar.  Other recent stable coins are more transparent. For example, TrueUSD complies with some standard financial regulations and uses escrow accounts. Utility Tokens Utility tokens represent a certain service or good on a specific platform -- kind of like a gift card to a specific store. They aren't really investments but they have value. Hayner likens them to casino chips: When you go to a casino, you exchange your dollars for chips and then can use those chips to play games. The chips serve a function because they allow you to do something and hold value but you have to exchange them to get actual cash. Taylor said he was skeptical of most utility tokens because they aren't the best way to interact with users. They require additional steps that make them more complicated to use and that could turn some people off.  However, he noted that they do make it possible to transact in extremely small quantities.  Security Tokens Security tokens are still relatively new. Their value is derived from real-world assets, which could include commodities like gold or oil, shares of a company or interest in a fund. These tokens are meant to be investments and because they're considered securities and subject to federal security regulations. Some fans of security tokens argue they would ensure greater accountability for companies because shares would be public and couldn't be over-issued. Both Hayner and Taylor say these tokens are still a ways off from showing up in people's portfolios because of uncertainty around how they'd be regulated.  And according to Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia Pacific for online trading platform Oanda, security tokens still don't provide enough of a ""consistent metric off which to base an underlying investment strategy.""  Security tokens, which would be regulated, also go against the very core of what crypto was meant to be -- a deregulated currency. But regulations would be a draw for investors. Non-Fungible Tokens  Non-fungible tokens have a unique value or use. They can store value but no two tokens are the same.  For example, in the video game CryptoKitties, users can use ether to buy digital cats. The digital kitties can be traded and bred, but each has its own unique non-fungible token that can't be replicated -- kind of like a digital fingerprint. Future of money? Digital currency is becoming more mainstream as companies like Starbucks and Goldman Sachs experiment with how to engage with it.  It's unclear whether crypto will be the future of money, but it's volatility isn't helping its case for wider adoption. As values continue to drop and rebound, investors continue to show caution. ""There's a lack of adoption on Wall Street,"" Innes said. ""The big banks that most people are doing business with are reticent to get involved, which I think is telling."" "
55,55,Bitcoin prices keeps plunging. When will they hit bottom?,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/investing/bitcoin-prices-plunging/index.html,"Nov 20, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)The recent plunge in the stock market is a cakewalk compared to what's going on with cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin prices are down more than 15% in just the past week and have plummeted nearly 70% so far this year. Bitcoin hit a peak above $19,000 in December 2017. Its is now trading at around $4,600.  Shares of companies with ties to the crypto market have plunged lately too, including chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which make graphics cards used by bitcoin miners. Online retailer turned blockchain investor Overstock (OSTK) and digital payments firm Square (SQ) are also sharply lower. Each stock is down between 15% and 35% in just the past month. So it seems safe to say that the bitcoin bubble has burst. Should investors start to dip their toe back in to bitcoin and other crypyto-related assets? Perhaps. Some bitcoin bulls are welcoming the recent volatility. It may be scaring away some of the momentum investors who rushed in, which means that bargain hunters can scoop up bitcoin at a more attractive price. ""Savvy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money and, as such, they will be capitalizing on the lower prices in order to build their portfolios and shore-up their positions,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory firm. Green compared the current shakeout to what happened with the dot-com boom and subsequent bust in the late 1990s. Many internet stocks crashed and burned, but Amazon (AMZN) is proof positive that e-commerce turned out to be a legitimate business and not just hype.  ""Financial traditionalists view cryptocurrencies the way traditional stores used to view online retailers,"" Green said. ""Crypto cynics are using this current wave of volatility to knock digital currencies. Whether it is Bitcoin, or any of the current generation of coins, or not, cryptocurrencies are here to stay."" SEC keeping a close eye on fishy ICOs There's also a more technical, wonky reason for why bitcoin is falling.  In the past year, bitcoin has gone through a splitting process known as a fork. The first fork created bitcoin cash -- and bitcoin cash has now recently split into two other forks as well. For the average investor, this basically just means more volatility. But there are still some potential problems for bitcoin and the legion of other cryptos out there, such as ethereum, litecoin, ripple and stellar. Their prices have all plunged lately too. Part of the problem is a bubble mentality. Short-term investors are all trying to get rich quick with these cryptocurrencies as well as initial coin offerings or ICOs. Those are securities backed by crypto assets.  But they are incredibly risky. And the Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to crack down on ICOs that don't pass regulatory muster. Just last week, the SEC fined two companies $250,000 each for failing to follow the proper laws for registering securities. One of the firms, Paragon, is working to legalize cannabis -- proving that it's possible to combine two investing manias in one company. ""The SEC reminded the crypto world that it has the final say over anything that smells like a security,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with Think Markets UK. ""The fear is that the SEC may not stop here and might take similar action against several companies that adopted a similar path."" Regulatory issues may be just the tip of the iceberg as well. Anthony Pompliano, a partner with crypto investing firm Morgan Creek Digital, wrote in a recent blog post that some crypto hedge funds may be forced to shut down due to the dramatic drop in prices. He argued that many firms won't be able to raise more capital and won't be able to survive. ""The current bear market is going to go from bad to worse very quickly for both crypto funds and ICO projects. The pain ahead is something that many of these entrepreneurs and fund managers have never had to deal with,"" Pompliano wrote.  But he sees light at the end of the tunnel. Pompliano believes that the current shakeout is necessary. It will rid the market of the weak hands and leave only true crypto believers -- as opposed to traders -- left to prosper from the continued overall growth in the crypto world. ""Things will get much worse before they get better. That is okay. Remember, bear markets get rid of the tourists so that the true entrepreneurs can focus on building sustainable value,"" Pompliano wrote.  "
56,56,Carlos Ghosn fallout; Bitcoin plunges; Soup wars,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"Nov 20, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"London (CNN Business)1. End of a business legend: The arrest of Carlos Ghosn in Japan on Monday is forcing three major automakers to make tough decisions about their leadership.  Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan (NSANY) Mitsubishi Motors (MMTOF) and Renault (RNSDF), was detained by Japanese authorities after an investigation by Nissan revealed ""significant acts of misconduct"" over many years. Nissan said the misconduct included significantly under-reporting his compensation and misusing company assets. Ghosn is yet to respond to the allegations. Ghosn is credited with rescuing Nissan and Renault, and stitching together three automakers into a global alliance. But he's now likely to be ousted as chair of all three.  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that he would meet with representatives from Renault on Tuesday to discuss appointing interim management because Ghosn is ""no longer capable of leading the group.""  The French government owns 15% of Renault. Ghosn also serves as CEO at the carmaker. Nissan's board will meet Thursday to remove Ghosn from his position. Mitsubishi has also asked its board of directors to ""promptly remove"" Ghosn as chairman. Shares in Renault dropped another 3.5% on Tuesday after getting rocked in the previous trading session. Nissan stock shed 5.5% in Tokyo and shares in Mitsubishi declined nearly 7%.  2. Down goes bitcoin: The price of bitcoin has plunged 15% over the past 24 hours, at one point reaching a low of $4,200. It continues to swing wildly.  As is often the case with digital currencies, the cause of the crash is unclear. The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently cracked down on ""initial coin offerings,"" and sales of crypto mining equipment appear to have slowed. Bitcoin prices are now roughly 75% below record levels set a year ago at the height of a bubble. 3. Soup earnings: Investors are eagerly awaiting an earnings report from Campbell Soup (CPB) amid a fierce proxy fight for control of its board.  Activist investor Daniel Loeb wants to replace five members of the company's 12-person board. Campbell management says it knows the company best and can put it back on the right track.  The struggling 149-year-old company has faced a slew of problems including poor sales, an ill-fated acquisition of Bolthouse and the abrupt departure of its CEO this year.  If Campbell has a strong quarter, management could use the good results to bolster its case. But if earnings disappoint, Loeb will be ready to pounce. 4. Global market overview:  US stock futures were lower, signaling another tough day of trading on Wall Street. European markets opened in negative territory on Tuesday. Germany's DAX led the retreat, shedding over 1%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.1% while benchmark indexes in Shanghai and Hong Kong lost roughly 2%. The Dow dropped 1.6% on Monday and the S&P 500 shed 1.7%.

Shares in Nvidia plunged nearly 17% in extended trading after the company's third quarter results came in significantly lower than expected. Shares in rival chipmaker AMD (AMD) slumped 5% after hours. The pain extended to Asia, where shares in gaming company Nintendo (NTDOY) dropped more than 9% on Friday and SoftBank (SFTBF) stock dropped over 3%. Some of the unease can be attributed to a sharp decline in the price of bitcoin. Nvidia (NVDA) specializes in making hardware for video game consoles and digital currency mining. 2. Brexit chaos: Investors are closely monitoring political developments in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Theresa May is fighting to keep her Brexit deal alive. The pound was flat Friday after falling as much as 2% against the dollar during the previous trading session. UK bank stocks including Lloyds (LYG), Barclays (BCS) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) were hit for a second consecutive day. Investors are worried that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal on Brexit. That would trigger new trade barriers and likely plunge the United Kingdom into recession.

58,58,Nvidia stock plummets after 'crypto hangover',http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/tech/nvidia-stock-earnings-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Nov 16, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Bitcoin's slump is causing a big headache for one of Silicon Valley's top tech firms.  Computer chipmaker Nvidia's stock plunged nearly 17% in after hours trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday, after the company's third quarter financial results came in significantly lower than expected.  Nvidia (NVDA) specializes in making hardware for video game consoles and digital currency mining, the process by which computers are used to create bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by solving complex math problems.  But bitcoin prices have more than halved this year after a spectacular rally in 2017. That has hit demand for Nvidia's technology, the company revealed Thursday, causing unsolved inventory of its products to pile up.     ""The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on a conference call with investors Thursday.   Things could get worse before they get better, with the price of bitcoin recently falling to its lowest level in a year. Nvidia said for the current holiday season quarter it now only expects to record revenues of $2.7 billion, compared to analyst forecasts of about $3.4 billion.  Nvidia isn't the only big US tech firm to suffer as a result of the crypto rout.  Rival chipmaker AMD (AMD) reported lower than expected earnings last quarter, blaming the cryptocurrency slump for a slowdown in sales. The company said it expects revenue to fall below analyst expectations in the current quarter as well.  AMD's stock was down about 5% in after hours trading. The sell-off in tech stocks spread to Asia on Friday. SoftBank (SFTBF) fell more than 3%, while video game maker Nintendo (NTDOY) dropped more than 9%.  Nintendo is a major customer of Nvidia, and any sign that Nintendo is buying fewer chips makes investors worry about demand for its own gaming systems, said Pelham Smithers, head of UK-based investment firm Pelham Smithers Associates.  Founded in 1993, Nvidia started off selling computer cards that improved the performance of video games. But it's since expanded into bigger and pricier areas. Today, one Nvidia product, the DGX, can cost as much as $149,000. Among Nvidia's key backers are Japanese tech giant SoftBank, whose $93 billion Vision Fund holds a sizable stake in the firm.  "

Uber losses accelerate: Uber continues to bleed money as it races toward a much-hyped IPO next year. The tech firm said Wednesday that it lost $1.07 billion in the three months ending in September, up from a loss of  $891 million in the previous quarter, as it invested in newer services ranging from food deliveries to scooters. Uber posted sales of $2.95 billion for the quarter, up about 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of more than a third from the same period a year earlier. The results highlight the challenge Uber faces in trying to generate the kind of rapid sales growth that investors expect from a newly public technology company without inflating its losses. Uber has repeatedly said it expects to go public in 2019. 2. China makes an offer: The Chinese government has presented an offer to the United States to try to push forward stalled trade talks, according to two people briefed on the discussions. The opening bid falls short of many of the core demands the White House has repeatedly detailed as must-haves in trade talks with Beijing, including addressing technology transfers and intellectual property theft, one of the people briefed told CNN.  Instead, the proposal has been described as a rehash of previous commitments Chinese leaders have publicly announced, like selectively lifting tariffs. ""What they are offering is not new,"" this person said. ""I think the two sides remain at an impasse. The channels are now open again, but there's a lot of work to get to — whether it's a modest de-escalation or ceasefire."" Talks have been revived ahead of a planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. 3. Brexit in chaos: The UK government's top official on Brexit, Dominic Raab, resigned on Thursday, throwing the UK-EU divorce deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May into doubt. The pound fell by 1.6% to below $1.28 on news of the resignation. It was trading flat earlier in the morning.  May said in a brief statement on Wednesday that she had secured the support of her cabinet to move ahead with the deal, which must also be approved by parliament. Now all bets are off, and the risk that Britain crashes out of the European Union is rising. There's also a slim chance Brits may eventually be asked to vote again on Brexit. 4. Fed chair on economic challenges: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the US economy is robust. But headwinds could build next year.  ""I'm very happy about the state of the economy now,"" he said Wednesday in Dallas. ""Our policy is part of the reason why our economy is in such a good place right now."" The central banker said markets need to be prepared for more rate hikes. ""If you look down the road, you see challenges ahead,"" he added.

60,60,"Bitcoin plunges below $6,000 to lowest level in more than a year",http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/tech/bitcoin-price-drop/index.html,"Nov 15, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"San Francisco (CNN Business)Bitcoin is on the ropes again.  Its price plummeted more than 10% on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level in more than a year. It's now trading below $6,000, far from the heights it reached during its meteoric rise at the end of 2017.  After nearly touching $20,000 in December 2017, bitcoin's value nosedived in volatile trading over the months that followed. But it has enjoyed a period of relative stability since early September, hovering between $6,000 and $7,000. Wednesday's drop is a sharp reminder that cryptocurrencies are still an extremely volatile investment. While some people have managed to get rich by trading digital currencies, most investors are all too familiar with their rapid, unpredictable price swings. The volatility comes from sudden changes in the perceived value of cryptocurrencies. Like stock prices, cryptocurrencies are affected by supply and demand — but hype also plays a major role in murky, loosely regulated markets where some investors have huge holdings.  Triggers such as alarming news reports and rumors of stricter regulation of the industry can lead to big moves in crypto markets. Bitcoin's plunge on Wednesday was driven in part by expectations that another major cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, will split into two on Thursday, according to Marshall Hayner, founder of Metal Pay, a cryptocurrency payments service. While bitcoin and bitcoin cash are separate, such events can fuel uncertainty and lead to crazy volatility across crypto markets. Hayner said bitcoin is also likely coming under pressure from fading hopes that the market will get stronger before the end of the year. As bitcoin's price spiked toward $20,000 near the end of last year, some of its boosters were optimistically predicting it could go as high as $50,000 in 2018. "
61,61,Market ends week with a thud. Dow down 200 points and tech stocks tank,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/investing/stock-markets-today-down/index.html,"Nov 9, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Remember the stock market surge Wednesday after the midterm elections? Investors took a bite out of those gains Friday.  The Dow finished the day down 202 points, a drop of nearly 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell almost 1%. And the Nasdaq was down about 1.7%, dragged lower by big drops in shares of tech titans Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL).  Concerns about the continued slide in oil prices as crude fell for the tenth straight day and the possibility the US-China trade war will lead to a slowdown in China's economy dragged the broader market lower.  A stronger dollar wasn't helping either, since the rise of the greenback eats into profits of blue chip US firms.  Investors were also still digesting Thursday's announcement from the Federal Reserve. The Fed did not raise rates but strongly suggested another hike is coming in December. That was also one of the reasons for the dollar's gains. The market may be underestimating how many more rate hikes there will be, Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investments, told CNN Business. ""The Fed has consistently raised rates more than expected. That may continue to be the case,"" he said. Hatheway added that investors may also be growing nervous about earnings growth slowing in 2019 and that rising wages will eat into profit margins. But despite Friday's losses, the broader market should still end the week in positive territory -- thanks to the post-Election Day rally Wednesday.  Investors cheered the possibility of gridlock in Washington as Democrats won control of the House while Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate.  The Dow rallied by nearly 3% this week -- its best performance since March -- while the S&P 500 gained more than 2%. The Nasdaq was up less than 1%. In corporate news, General Electric (GE) plunged 6% after an analyst at JPMorgan Chase slashed his price target on the troubled conglomerate to just $6 a share. GE has lost more than half its value this year. Several tech companies reported earnings and outlooks that disappointed investors as well, including gaming giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI), online retailer and bitcoin investor Overstock (OSTK) and reviews site Yelp (YELP).  Activision and Overstock were each down about 15% while Yelp plummeted nearly 30%.  Shares of Chinese online retail giant Alibaba (BABA) fell 3% despite the fact that the company is gearing up for Singles' Day -- an annual shopping extravaganza for Chinese consumers -- on Sunday. (Singles' Day is always 11/11 -- a day of four ones.) The one notable bright spot on the earnings landscape? Media giant Disney (DIS) impressed investors with solid results from its movie studio business. Disney's stock was up 2% and hit its highest level in nearly three years. But shares of streaming media king Netflix (NFLX) dipped more than 4.5% -- partly due to the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger announced more content plans for the company's upcoming Netflix rival, which will be called Disney+.

62,62,"Investors think too highly of America, and Millennials have too much cash, survey finds",http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/05/investing/legg-mason-investor-survey/index.html,"Nov 5, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)US investors think way too highly of America. Millennials have more cash than they need and not enough stocks. And nobody actually thinks owning bitcoin is a good idea.  Those are some of the findings from a recent online survey of 1,000 investors conducted by asset management firm Legg Mason between late July and late August. Michael LaBella, head of global equity strategy at QS Investors, a Legg Mason affiliate, said he was surprised that investors remained so optimistic about the US stock market considering that the bull market will hit its 10th anniversary in March. This is one of the longest US bull markets ever, but the rest of the world hasn't performed as well over the past decade. Still, two-thirds of the respondents indicated that they expected the US stock market to keep rising over the next twelve months, according to the survey. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said they thought the United States was the best investing opportunity -- despite worries about the trade war with China and rising interest rates.  ""Investors are broadly more bullish but they have more exposure to the US than international markets,"" LaBella said. ""There is an opportunity in international markets and people are under allocated there."" In addition to the lack of overseas exposure, LaBella said he was most surprised that younger investors are still so afraid to put money into stocks -- even though the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession are now 10 years in the rear-view mirror. Millennials still scarred by 2008 According to the Legg Mason survey, 56% of Millennials indicated that their current investing strategy is influenced by memories of 2008. To that end, Millennials have more money in cash (25.4%) than stocks (17.9%) in their portfolios. This overly conservative investing philosophy could come back to haunt them, LaBella said. ""Millennials have the luxury of time on their side. They should be taking more risk but they have more money in cash than stocks than baby boomers who are just about to retire,"" he said.  But LaBella said that the most surprising finding was not one of the 1,000 investors said they owned bitcoin or other similar assets. That may be because the price of bitcoin and other cryptos have plunged in the past few months. But he also thinks it may have something to do with the fact that bitcoin is still viewed as a more speculative, get rich quick trade as opposed to a viable long-term investment. He pointed out that the survey's participants still had exposure to other assets outside of stocks and cash, such as bonds, gold, real estate and other alternative investments.  ""A lot of people talk about bitcoin but it's interesting that not one person in our survey said they actually owned it,"" LaBella said. "
63,63,Bitcoin is 10 years old,http://www.cnn.com/2018/11/02/tech/bitcoin-tenth-anniversary-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Nov 2, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Bitcoin may have turned 10 years old but its continued drop in value is hardly cause for celebration.  On Thursday, the price of one bitcoin was down to about $6,320. Its price has dropped dramatically since its all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. The cryptocurrency started the year at just under $13,500 and has been down ever since.  Although bitcoin's infamous price rise launched it into the mainstream last year, it's hardly a new concept. Wednesday marked the 10th anniversary of a white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto that detailed for the first time how bitcoin could work.  It was published on a cryptocurrency mailing list shortly after the start of the financial crisis in 2008. The concept, which is an alternative to fiat currencies such as the US dollar, served as a way for people to exchange money without a regulatory middle man. Nakamoto described how new bitcoins coins could be created through a process called mining, which requires powerful computers that solve complex math problems. Months after the white paper published, Nakamoto mined the first block of bitcoin, which generated 50 bitcoins.  Little is known about the creator. Nakamoto is a pseudonym — and even a decade later, it's still unclear who exactly that is. But the publication of the paper was a groundbreaking moment. According to Maya Kumar, an executive who oversees the UK and Ireland operations at Luno, an app that helps users buy bitcoin, it paved the way for the next phase in the evolution of money. ""The invention of bitcoin and the underlying blockchain [that supports it] has allowed us all to reimagine money,"" Kumar told CNN Business. ""We are seeing a new parallel financial system being built in real time."" Bitcoin relies on cryptography, which uses hidden codes to communicate. Users can make transactions directly under pseudonyms, taking away power from banks and governments, and it is not controlled by a central authority.  For bitcoin, each problem takes about 10 minutes to solve and creates a predetermined number of coins. The number that is awarded for solving each problem dwindles as time goes on.  Nakamoto's system only allows a fixed number of coins to be created — there's a limit of 21 million bitcoins that can ever be generated.  Eiland Glover, the CEO of coin company Kowala, said this fixed number will limit bitcoin's future. ""There can only ever be so many bitcoin supplied so if demand grows and you have a limited number, there's deflation and volatility,"" Glover said. His company and others are attempting to create more stable coins that are tied to the US dollar — a move he believes will make the value of the coins less volatile.  Glover calls Nakamoto's white paper ""the most essential foundational paper"" but he notes how people have been trying to improve it.  Bitcoin's early adopters sometimes tried to make clandestine and illegal transactions. Over time, it gained broader adoption.  In 2014, Overstock became the first major US retailer to accept bitcoin. Companies such as Expedia and Microsoft followed, and now even Starbucks wants to find a way to let customers use bitcoin to pay for their caffeine fixes. Bitcoin is far from the only cryptocurrency available. From ether and litecoin to even cryptokitties, there are more than 1,500 options. But bitcoin is the oldest, biggest and most popular.  Although supply and demand play a role in its volatility, so does hype from news coverage. For example, the news of a cryptocurrency exchange hack can cause prices to drop, while the potential of tighter regulation leads to a boost.  But bitcoin's growing popularity and entrance into the mainstream suggest the coin isn't going anywhere anytime soon, according to multiple experts. Stability is needed for any digital currency to succeed.  For now, we'll see how bitcoin evolves as a teen.  "
64,64,Crypto slowdown tanks AMD stock,http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/tech/amd-stock/index.html,"Oct 25, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin helped make AMD a darling of Wall Street. But cryptocurrencies have lost their luster and the company with the hottest stock is now feeling the pinch.  AMD stock plunged 20% in premarket trading after the chip maker announced third quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. It warned of a weaker outlook.  The company said that slowing sales were ""caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand"" for its graphics processors. The blockchain sector as a whole has been significantly cooling because of volatility in cryptocurrency markets.  AMD's (AMD) powerful graphic processors have been instrumental for running crypto's backend technology and its chips seemed preferable to the ones produced by rivals Intel and Nvidia.   Revenue from blockchain was ""negligible"" in third quarter compared to the same period in 2017, AMD's CFO Devinder Kumar said on an earnings call.  AMD expects revenue to fall below analyst's expectations next quarter, too, he said.  Nvidia (NVDA) shares were down nearly 10% in premarket trading and Intel (INTC) was down nearly 5%.  It wasn't all bad news at AMD. Its third quarter revenue jumped by 4% compared with a year ago to $1.65 billion, but fell below Wall Street expectations for $1.7 billion.  AMD has dropped 30% since it hit a 12-year-high in September. But it's stock is still up a whopping 121% for the year. "
65,65,"The world is embracing digital currency, and the US is falling behind",http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/perspectives/digital-currency-race/index.html,"Oct 12, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Sheila Warren is the project head of blockchain policy at the World Economic Forum. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.  For many people all over the world, paper cash and metal coins are already items of memory. Mobile payment providers, like Apply Pay and Samsung Pay, are being used at cash registers in countries like the United Kingdom and Japan, and people have responded well to the ease of this system and some of the benefits it provides.  But some countries, like the United States, are already falling behind in this race to adopt digital currency.   Mobile payments in the US hit $112 billion in 2016, while they were $5.5 trillion in China, according to iResearch. One of the main reasons is because China is a global leader in e-commerce. It is forecast to reach almost $2 trillion by 2022, according to Forrester, and the industry has developed rapidly through support from the government and rising business stars that are now giants: Alibaba, Tencent and JD.com.  As the technology developed and as support for e-commerce grew, many Chinese cities skipped right over credit card machines in favor of digital payments via WeChat and similar providers. The infrastructure, systems and processes to handle digital payments were relatively easy to adapt, and both industry and the government readily embraced the new digital reality. Because of this kind of support, the ecosystem was able to leapfrog over less advanced technologies and move directly to more advanced ones.  In environments like this where mobile payment is already de rigueur, there's little psychological barrier to the widespread adoption of digital currency. If people do not think of paper cash or checks as meaningful alternatives, let alone a default, they are likely to be more open to a digital currency and possibly even to cryptocurrency. They are already used to the speed and ease of digital payments, and because they have been using e-money in some form or another for years, the leap from payments via WeChat, for instance, to bitcoin would be smaller than the leap from cash straight to bitcoin.  The reduction in hurdles to adoption means that these societies are poised to reap its broader benefits, including potentially an adaptation to cryptocurrency, should such adaptation prove useful.  Some countries are already starting to see the benefits, like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where digital currency in some form or another is here to stay, and those systems that accommodate its existence are going to come out ahead of those that don't. That's because e-payments can lower the cost of doing business; electronic records can make transactions more transparent, leading to less black-market activity and more tax dollars; and blockchain and distributed ledger technology can help to ensure that information has been validated and not altered by nefarious parties.  As paper currency moves (albeit slowly) toward becoming a thing of the past in a growing number of economies, new models such as tokens and cryptocurrency may begin to rise in usage. If we want to look ahead to see the next steps for businesses and companies adopting new forms of payment/value exchange, we can look at some familiar names to see how they are already starting to adapt. Companies like Overstock, Expedia and Virgin Galactic already accept bitcoin as a form of payment and major charitable organizations are contending with — and in many cases actively soliciting — donations of cryptocurrency.  Just as legal and other systems had to contend with stock, they're being forced to contend with cryptocurrency and assess whether policies and processes put in place in a different era still apply.  With changes in technology, and especially with monetary policy, accompanying this new digital reality are regulatory responses that acknowledge the new state of affairs. Some countries, including Morocco and Bolivia, have reacted defensively, choosing to ban bitcoin or push out exchanges. Others, like Switzerland, have served as havens for this new approach to money, allowing for sanctioned experimentation via regulatory sandboxes, or even embracing experimentation with cryptocurrency altogether.   Regardless of how a country reacts, technology does not understand boundaries.  Technology will keep progressing in the countries and economies that want to take advantage of the speed or the agility that the digital world offers.  The rate of acceleration of adoption is likely to continue to increase, meaning that those economies that don't start encouraging the creation of a robust digital payment infrastructure, complete with the necessary investments in infrastructure and accompanying regulation, are going to find it increasingly challenging to catch up.

66,66,This is blockchain and here's why it matters,http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/tech/blockchain-explainer/index.html,"Oct 4, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"San Francisco (CNN Business)You've almost certainly heard the term blockchain. But you probably have no idea what it is or how it works, let alone why it generates so much hype. That's OK. Most people don't. That hasn't kept it from becoming a buzzword thrown around in almost every industry, from finance to shipping to fantasy football. A-list companies like Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Walmart believe blockchain technology can track shipments, store data more efficiently, and do many other helpful things. They aren't alone in embracing the technology, which many people believe could revolutionize logistics, food safety, banking, and even voting. Not bad for an esoteric technology developed by the enigmatic fellow who created bitcoin. Of course, none of that answers your underlying question: What is blockchain technology and why is everyone so excited about it? A public digital ledger A blockchain is essentially an immutable public digital ledger. Once someone enters a transaction, it cannot easily be changed. An analogy might help explain how it works.  Think back to when people used a checkbook register to keep track of purchases and payments. Now extrapolate that to include countless transactions by millions of people and imagine that copies of the register are held by thousands of computers. Each computer must verify a transaction before it can be noted in the register. Once verified, a transaction is written in permanent ink.  The register records transactions for a set period of time, which can be as little as 10 minutes. Once the register is filled, it is stapled shut, and labeled with a unique alphanumeric sequence that identifies it. A new register is then started and glued to the first. Eventually you wind up with a chain of registers. That's essentially what a blockchain is. The fact that these registers are stored on many, many computers makes them essentially unchangeable and unhackable. To continue with the analogy, you'd have to work backward, ungluing every checkbook until you got to the one containing the transaction you want to change before making the revision. And you'd have to repeat this process for every copy of the register. You couldn't do it without it being noticed. The biggest advantage to public blockchains is that the information can't really be changed once it's been logged. There's a permanent record, and because the ledger is held by many entities, it's nearly impossible to hack. The entries are also made using pseudonyms, so there's a certain degree of privacy, and no one person wields full authority over the ledger. That makes blockchain ideal for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And a great many other things — although people disagree about how effective it will be for certain applications. A little history Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain in 2008 when he developed bitcoin. Nakamoto, an enigmatic figure who has proved all but impossible to definitively identify, wanted a decentralized, permanent and public means of recording the creation and distribution of every bitcoin. Today blockchains underpin a dizzying number of cryptocurrencies. But that's another story. So far, people have mined more than 16 million of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Every one of them, and any transaction using them, has been recorded on a blockchain. That gives you a sense of the volume of data the technology can handle. Although Nakamoto designed blockchain as a public ledger, it wasn't long before permissions-backed blockchains controlled by a given company or group appeared. They don't offer the same level of immutability because they're held on a far smaller number of computers. And, despite the hype, the thinking behind them isn't new. ""[Permission-based blockchains] are 20-year-old ideas,"" said Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at The International Computer Science Institute. ""Whenever someone says 'private blockchain,' just mentally replace that with a Google Doc that can only be updated."" Practical applications Already companies are using blockchains to do things like manage pharmaceutical information, track freight shipments and trace the origin of food. Each application touts the ability of blockchains to keep a complete record of data in a system that can't be easily changed. Still, some people question the utility of the underlying technology. Sure, it's great for cryptocurrency. But critics scoff at the idea that it's going to revolutionize anything. ""Someone who says blockchain can be used to solve Problem X doesn't understand Problem X,"" Weaver said.  He cites the popular example of using a blockchain to track the production and distribution of food. Advocates say it would improve safety and make it easier to, say, identify the origin of a salmonella outbreak. It would be far easier to use RFID chips or QR codes, he said. Such technology provides a more reliable record because it does not require a person to manually record the data on the ledger, a process that invariably introduces human error. But Catherine Tucker, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, sees tremendous potential in blockchain technology. She sees blockchains being most useful for managing digital currencies and tracking health and insurance data.  ""I think we can all agree that the way we store and record data has not transformed in the same way that other aspects of our use of digital data has,"" she said. ""It makes a lot of sense to identify better technologies for recording data and ensuring its integrity."" Tucker said the important thing for early adopters of blockchain technology to remember is that the technology is ""evolving"" and companies shouldn't embrace it just for the sake of embracing it. Instead, they ought to make sure they genuinely need the tech and, once they've adopted it, make sure they adapt to changes as it evolves, she said. So who's using it? IBM is a major player in the space, with more than 500 blockchain-related projects in the realms of shipping, banking and food safety. For example, its TradeLens project aims to improve shipping by minimizing paperwork and the documentation errors that often accompany it. More than 150 million transactions have already been logged on its blockchain. Other major companies are dabbling in the technology. Walmart hopes to improve the safety of the food it sells by using a blockchain to track its path from production to customer. Microsoft has been exploring its potential for data sharing, JPMorgan Chase is planning pilot programs with it, and American Express has been experimenting with its use in rewards programs for customers. Academia is fixated on it, too. Columbia University plans to launch a blockchain research center before long. Schools like MIT already explore the technology's possibilities.  Even companies that wouldn't seem like natural fits for the technology are embracing it. The Crown League, the world's first professional fantasy football league, believes using a blockchain to keep track of wins, losses and earnings will ensure accuracy and fairness by creating an indelible record. But even Tucker concedes blockchain may not be the answer to every problem. ""The key thing about blockchain technology is that you must have a use case for why you need digital data to be persistent and unchangeable,"" she said. ""It makes sense for digital currencies and also health data and insurance data. It makes less sense in industries where the usefulness of data is more temporary."" It seems the number of people who understand that may be only slightly higher than the number of people who understand what a blockchain is. "
67,67,What you need to know before investing in cryptocurrency,http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/05/tech/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-explainer/index.html,"Oct 5, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"San Francisco (CNN Business)Everyone's talking about cryptocurrencies, even if they don't fully understand them. Some people are even investing in them. Joining the craze is only getting easier. Apps like RobinHood and exchanges like CoinBase make investing in bitcoin, ether and a dizzying number of other digital currencies as simple as pointing and clicking. Even banks and brokerages are cashing in. Although some people get rich, many more do not. That's because cryptocurrencies are so volatile that a chart of their value looks like an EKG printout. The price of bitcoin rose more than 2,000% in 2017 to a record $20,000, but by early 2018, it had fallen more than 50%. For most of September, bitcoin was trading at just over $6,000.  The rollercoaster nature arises from sudden changes in the perceived value of a given cryptocurrency. Although their prices are, like traditional stocks, determined by supply and demand, hype also plays a role. News coverage can influence prices, too. Any mention of someone hacking a cryptocurrency exchange sends prices plummeting, for example, while even the rumor of greater regulation reassures investors and drives up prices.  Adding to the uncertainty, the space is largely unregulated and bad actors abound. While companies face many regulatory hurdles before an initial public offering, launching an initial coin offering is much easier as the space is so unregulated. That makes it easy to place ill-fated investments in poorly conceived or dubious companies that haven't been vetted, let alone required to meet any financial, accounting, or ethical standards. That leads some people to argue that no one truly invests in cryptocurrencies, they only speculate on it. ""Their only value is in the belief that someone later will pay more,"" says Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at The International Computer Science Institute.  None of this leaves people any less eager to bet on bitcoin and its ilk. But anyone thinking of doing so should think twice. And perhaps think twice again.  Still interested in trading? Here are a few things you need to know. So what is cryptocurrency, anyway? Cryptocurrency is essentially digital money traded from one person to another through the use of pseudonyms. There are no intermediaries like banks, no governmental oversight or authority, and no fees. The ""crypto"" in cryptocurrency refers to the use of cryptography to ensure the security and privacy of every transaction. New coins are created through a technique called mining. The process requires powerful computers that solve complex math problems. Each problem should take about 10 minutes to solve, and results in the creation of a predetermined number of coins. The total number of coins that can be created is fixed — there's a limit of 21 million bitcoins that can be created. The number of coins rewarded for solving each problem dwindles as time goes on.  Bitcoin is believed to have been created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an enigmatic figure who has so far proven all but impossible to definitively identify. By using cryptography to control the creation and tracking of a digital currency, Nakamoto took that power away from central authorities like governments.  Bitcoin was the first and most famous digital currency, but you can choose from more than 1,500, including ether, litecoin and even cryptokitties. For awhile, you saw these currencies only in the darkest corners of the internet, where people used them for all sorts of questionable, even illegal, activities. Drug dealers liked them because they made transactions all but invisible, and trolls at the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency used bitcoin to finance their campaign to influence the 2016 election.  That started to change in 2014, when Overstock became the first major US retailer to accept bitcoin. Companies like Expedia and Microsoft followed suit. Cryptocurrencies have moved to far into the mainstream that even Starbucks wants to find a way of letting customers use bitcoin to pay for their pumpkin spice latte.  One of the biggest misconceptions about cryptocurrencies is that you need thousands of dollars to invest. It's an easy assumption to make, especially in the case of bitcoin, which stayed under $1,000 from about 2010 to 2017. But then it took off, surpassing thousand-dollar milestones at a pace that seemed quicker than you could refresh your phone.  The staggering value is off-putting to many. But unlike most stocks, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin so you don't need thousands to get into the crypto game. And what's this blockchain I keep hearing about? Blockchain is the underlying technology that makes the whole thing work. It is kind of a public, digital ledger of transactions. An analogy might help.  Think back to when people used a checkbook register to keep track of purchases and payments. Now extrapolate that to include countless transactions by millions of people, and imagine that copies of the register are held by thousands of computers. Each computer must verify a transaction before it can be noted in the register. Once verified, a transaction is written in permanent ink and can't be erased. When the register is filled, a new checkbook is started and stapled to the first. Eventually there's a chain of registers. That's essentially what a blockchain is. And every transaction is pseudonymous, making cryptocurrency an ideal option for people looking to trade in private. So far blockchain technology has been used to track financial transactions, but people are starting to explore its record-keeping capabilities in banking, sports, health care and even food safety. But that's another story. I want in. How do I get started? You'll need two things to start trading crypto: An exchange and a wallet.  An exchange is what you need to convert your local currency, like the US dollar, into crypto. Think of it like the NYSE where cash is converted into stocks or other securities. A wallet is where you store your crypto and it's what allows you to send and receive crypto.  There are two main types of wallets: software and hardware. Software wallets run on an app or device and are useful if you want to actively trade. Hardware wallets are physical storage devices designed for holding crypto over the long term. It's a bit like a vault. The thing to know about hardware wallets is that, while they're highly secure, they're not ideal for people looking to make quick trades as it takes several hours or even days to get crypto out of them.  Many companies provide wallets or exchanges. Some, like Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, offer both.""We think it's the best way to offer a new person in the ecosystem an easy entry point,"" said Dan Romero, the GM of Coinbase Consumers.  But before you consider making a major investment, it's important to remember that cryptocurrency is new technology. Tread lightly. ""You shouldn't put your life savings in it,"" Romero warns. It's also important to realize that once you make a trade, you can't reverse it. Be absolutely sure you are sending to the right person or institution. Mistakes cannot be undone. Oh, and there's no insurance, either — if someone hacks your wallet and swipes your bitcoin, tough luck. Some exchanges, like Coinbase, offer insurance against company-wide hacks though. Trades are made using public and private keys. A public key is like an email address and a private key is like the password for that email account. If you have someone's address, you can send them an email, but you can't access their emails unless you also have their password.  That's how trading crypto works: You send and receive by giving out or using your public key but you have to keep your private key protected otherwise anyone can access your crypto. What could possibly go wrong? The biggest problem with cryptocurrencies is also what makes them so attractive to some investors: Their lack of regulation and decentralized nature provide buyers and sellers a degree of privacy they don't get from traditional investments. But that also means there's little oversight or security and your investments are largely unprotected. That's prompted many central banks to warn against using cryptocurrencies, and Warren Buffett went so far as to say bitcoin is ""probably rat poison squared."" Even Goldman Sachs, which announced in May that it would launch a bitcoin trading desk, recently seemed less sure. Its mid-year economic report said cryptocurrency is ""neither a medium of exchange, nor a unit of measurement, nor a store of value."" UBS has voiced similar concerns, saying cryptocurrency is too ""unstable"" to go mainstream.  Investing always carries some risk, but for now the world of cryptocurrency seems more Wild West than stock market. Anyone thinking of doing so should think twice. And perhaps think twice again.  "
68,68,"The average bitcoin investor really is young, rich and male",http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/05/tech/bitcoin-investors-survey/index.html,"Oct 5, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"New York (CNN Business)Who owns and trades bitcoin? Young, relatively well-off men living in big cities.  Most people know what bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are and feel comfortable explaining them to others. But the true bitcoin fans are Millennial men earning more than $75,000 a year in urban areas, according to a recent survey of more than 1,000 Americans. The survey was conducted by Clovr, a company focused on promoting the mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies -- the digital ledgers that record bitcoin transactions. It is one of the first comprehensive studies of who owns cryptocurrencies. It may not be a huge surprise to learn that the biggest bitcoin evangelists are young men. But the results will still be a blow to true cryptocurrency evangelists. That's because, in addition to the limited reach it found, the survey's results also show that the primary reason people invest in cryptocurrencies is the possibility of a huge return -- not because they necessary think digital currencies are the future of money. In other words, people view bitcoin much like internet stocks in the late 1990s or marijuana stocks today: a highly speculative investment.  The bitcoin boom is also about latching on to a hot fad -- investors know others who are doing it and they also have a fear of missing out.  That tends to be a recipe for disaster. Individual investors often chase momentum and get in too late. They're still buying when the so-called smart money (big mutual funds and hedge funds) are selling. And even though bitcoin prices have come crashing down this year, that doesn't mean that the worst is necessarily over. After all, the price of one bitcoin, trading at about $6,400, is up a staggering 3,000% in the past five years. There is arguably still a lot of room to fall. Mike Cribari, a co-founder of Clovr, said he was a bit surprised that eagerness to make a fast buck was the top reason for buying bitcoin.  ""A lot of people involved in speculative investments -- going for long shots -- don't fall into high income brackets,"" Cribari said, referring to numerous studies about how casinos, lotteries and other forms of gambling are often considered taxes on the poor.  People won't begin to think of cryptocurrencies as a true replacement for dollars, euros, yen and other government-backed paper currencies for some time. For that to happen, bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies will have to be available in more applications that people use in their daily lives. ""It's hard for people to understand things like private keys and transfers,"" said Cribari. ""People need to be able to use cryptocurrencies more for things like buying their lunch."" We might be getting closer to that point. Starbucks, Microsoft and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange have launched Bakkt, a service that will let people convert bitcoins and other crypto assets into dollars. And Goldman Sachs backs Circle, a startup that lets people invest and trade in cryptocurrencies and also transfer digital payments via an app that works like text messaging. Crypto hangups Bitcoin definitely isn't for everyone. Some high-profile hacking incidents of bitcoin wallets may be scaring some people away from cryptocurrencies, Cribari said. The breakneck volatility in the crypro market isn't helping either. Bitcoin prices surged 50% in the past 12 months but are down 50% so far this year. The top reason people gave for avoiding crypto investments was that it's too risky. Cribari said he's hopeful that the wild swings are over. After peaking at nearly $20,000 last December, bitcoin prices have stabilized in a range of between $6,000 and $7,000 over the past few months. More average investors are getting comfortable with the thought of using bitcoin for everyday purchases and owning bitcoin for the long haul, a separate survey found. More than half of the Millennials and more than a third of the Gen Xers polled said they thought cryptocurrencies would become as widely accepted as cash and credit cards, according to BitcoinIRA.com, which lets people buy bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for their retirement accounts. Nearly 30% of the Baby Boomers surveyed indicated that they would consider investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for their retirement. "

The report from FireEye says a group called APT38 has conducted operations against 16 organizations in at least 11 countries ""sometimes simultaneously,"" which indicate the group has a ""large, prolific operation with extensive resources.""  The report also states that the probable number of institutions targeted by the group is likely higher and it has successfully stolen over $100 million through its operations since 2014. Pyongyang's increasingly bold attacks in the virtual space have come in tandem with the hermit nation's rapidly progressing ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Those operations have continued despite ongoing diplomatic talks with the US and South Korea.  The Trump administration has made it clear that it will not lift economic sanctions that have been levied against North Korea until denuclearization is achieved, prompting Pyongyang to consider alternative sources of revenue. ""The heavily sanctioned and cash-strapped North also uses cyberattacks to generate illicit funds from ransom payments, cryptocurrency exchange hacks, and fraudulent inter-bank transfer orders,"" according to a new report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.  North Korea could also use its cyber capabilities to attack the US economy, warns FDD's Samantha Ravich, senior adviser and Principal Investigator of FDD's cyber-enabled economic warfare (CEEW) project. ""Fifteen or even 10 years ago, when analyzing potential blowback to US sanctions on North Korea or US-South Korean military exercises, there was never a consideration of the Kim regime's ability to target the US economy,"" said Ravich.  ""Now, North Korea has one of the most capable and aggressive cyberoperations. Facing intense US economic sanctions, Pyongyang may consider using its cybercapabilities to attack the US economy,"" she said. North Korea's hackers have been accused of carrying out some of the most audacious cyberattacks of the past few years, from siphoning millions of dollars to stealing state secrets. Last month, the Justice Department announced cyberhacking charges against a North Korean national linked to the computer hacking of Sony in 2014, the WannaCry ransomware attack, and other significant cyberintrusions. The country's hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment led the Obama administration to impose economic sanctions against North Korean government agencies and senior officials. The DOJ announcement marked the first time US prosecutors have brought criminal charges against an official associated with the Sony breach and other attacks, with the DOJ targeting North Korean computer programmer Park Jin Hyok. In February 2016, $101 million was fraudulently transferred out of the Bangladesh central bank's account at the New York Federal Reserve and eventually made its way to the Philippines. Researchers found that the hackers responsible for the theft carefully routed their signal through France, South Korea and Taiwan to setup their attack server, but made a critical mistake that established a connection to North Korea. Most of the funds have not been recovered. Analysts say North Korea has been preparing similar operations targeting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as international sanctions make it harder for North Korea to use the dollar. "

But so did four of the largest point gains.   Investors were left dazed and confused. After the failure of Lehman Brothers came the bailout of insurer AIG (AIG), the fire sales of Wachovia to Wells Fargo (WFC) and Merrill Lynch to Bank of America (BAC), and the failure of giant savings and loan Washington Mutual and its subsequent sale to JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

But by and large, investors are putting less of their money into individual stocks.   Those who are still investing are picking less risky (in theory, at least) assets. Passively managed index exchange-traded funds, which are more affordable than mutual funds and tend to mimic the performance of the broader market, have become popular.   ETFs are also a better way to invest for people who don't want to research individual companies. It's not about picking stocks that may outperform the market. It's a way to get exposure to all the top stocks — a strategy that's perceived as safe.   Many investors are also skeptical of this aging bull and feel that the only reason stocks have done so well the past decade is because the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates unusually low for so long.   The Fed also engaged in several rounds of so-called quantitative easing, buying $3.6 trillion in Treasury bonds and other assets in order to push long-term rates down.  This is a modal window.   All this stimulus may have created an easy money environment and set the stage for the next bubble bursting, especially now that the Fed has started to raise rates again.   This risk-averse way of investing may not change anytime soon, particularly for the tens of millions of millennials now in the workforce who need to figure out what to do with their 401(k) plans.   ""Millennial investors coming of age in the 2000s may never look at equities the way the Baby Boomers did growing up in the bull market of the 1980s and '90s,"" wrote David Lafferty, chief market strategist of Natixis Investment Managers, in a report.   He said younger investors now care more about protecting what they are investing as opposed to making huge returns on it.   ""While some scar tissue has built up, investors have been forever altered,"" Lafferty added. ""Investors are more skittish and therefore more likely to bail when volatility rears its head again."" "
71,71,The companies behind bitcoin are trying to go public at a really bad time,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/27/technology/bitcoin-mining-ipo/index.html,"Sep 27, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Three of the world's top makers of cryptocurrency technology are planning to sell shares, giving investors a new way to bet on digital currencies. They're reportedly hoping to raise billions of dollars.   Unlike the dollar or the euro, which are issued by central banks, cryptocurrencies are based on computer code. Bitcoin, for example, is created and traded through the ""mining"" process in which computer algorithms solve increasingly complex math problems.   Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, which are all based in China, make money by selling the high-tech parts and systems that power this mining. Together, they dominate the business.   But the three companies operate in a young, unpredictable industry and are planning their IPOs in Hong Kong in brutal market conditions. The price of bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 in December, has since plunged by about two-thirds. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum have plummeted, too.   ""If the market price of cryptocurrencies suddenly falls ... demand for our mining hardware and cryptocurrency mining services will also drop rapidly,"" Bitmain warned potential investors this week.     On top of that, Hong Kong's stock market, where the companies plan to list, entered a bear market this month, having plunged more than 20% from its previous peak because of concerns about China's economic slowdown and trade war with the United States.   The mining technology companies haven't said when exactly they plan to go public or how much they're seeking to raise. Bitmain and Canaan declined interview requests, while Ebang didn't respond to a request.   ""These firms might be looking to cash out before the market takes an even steeper nosedive,"" said Benjamin Quinlan, founder of Hong Kong-based financial services consulting firm Quinlan & Associates.   He points out that cryptocurrencies are slowly gaining more acceptance among mainstream investors despite recent setbacks, and that the three mining companies' revenues are still growing. But the industry faces major challenges.   A key one is how governments go about regulating digital currencies. Last year, China banned most activities involving bitcoin. The country is still thought to be home to a significant number of cryptocurrency mining operations, but authorities have been trying to push them out.     Cryptocurrency miners need huge amounts of electricity to run their rooms full of computing equipment around the clock. Some public utilities in the United States are already introducing higher tariffs specifically for miners.   ""Increasing the cost of bitcoin mining will decrease the demand for mining equipment, hindering the performance of these companies,"" Quinlan said.   Mining cryptocurrencies is already less lucrative than it used to be.   Bitcoin mining activity has exploded over the past year, boosting demand for the technology. But that means the profits from mining are spread more thinly across a greater number of users. That could hit future demand for mining equipment.      Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang were all profitable in their most recent financial year, according to documents setting out their intention to go public.   But staying in the black will be a ""massive challenge,"" said Leilei Wang, a Shanghai-based consultant at research firm Kapronasia.   The companies are aware of the risks they face and are trying to adapt. For example, they say they are increasing investment in more advanced chip technology that can be used in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and connected devices.  This is a modal window.     Although the Chinese government has a tough stance on cryptocurrencies in general, it's eager to bulk up the country's technological prowess in areas like computer chips. Chinese companies are still largely reliant on foreign chip technology, especially from the United States.   ""Whether [the cryptocurrency companies] are able to successfully pivot remains to be seen,"" Wang said.   For now, their fate is tied to that of the wider industry.   ""Cryptocurrencies will likely fall out of favor"" without greater mainstream adoption in the near future, Quinlan predicted. The mining equipment makers ""will find it extremely difficult to survive when the cryptocurrency market, as a whole, withers away,"" he said.   But bitcoin bulls are still hopeful that the currency can stage a recovery as financial exchanges and big companies start to take it more seriously.   ""As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up,"" Mike Novogratz, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm Galaxy Digital, told CNN this week. "

""You're seeing now institutions moving in,"" the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital told CNN international correspondent Paula Newton on CNNMoney's ""Markets Now"" on Wednesday.   Novogratz pointed out that exchanges and big companies are starting to take the cryptocurrency more seriously.   ""Starbucks and Microsoft'll allow you to use bitcoin,"" he said. ""As you see more adoption of just people being comfortable with it, it feels like it's going to go up.""   More institutions will jump on board for fear of missing out, Novogratz said.   ""There's an institutional FOMO going on all of a sudden,"" he said.   Eventually, bitcoin may become a part of people's financial portfolios.   ""As you start getting custody and service providers in and around the system, it allows pension funds and endowments to get involved.""   He said that over time, more people will start to think of bitcoin as a store of value, like gold.   Galaxy and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index in May. The index tracks the performance of 10 digital currencies, including bitcoin and ethereum.   The price of one bitcoin surged to almost $20,000 late last year, then lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2018.   But Novogratz thinks the cryptocurrency hit bottom earlier this month. He predicts bitcoin will rally 30% by the end of the year. And in the first quarter of next year, ""you'll really start seeing it move.""   While Novogratz is bullish on crypto, he's cautious on cannabis. But he thinks comparisons between the two are fair.   ""There's a lot of similarities to crypto of 2017,"" he said. ""There's a limited supply of something that's going to be a major, major theme over the next 5-10 years.""   Shares of the cannabis company Tilray (TLRY) swung wildly last week. Others have surged on reports of investment or interest from big companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and Constellation Brands (STZ).   Novogratz isn't ready to invest yet.   ""I'll get in cannabis on a significant sell-off from here,"" he said. When the companies shed about 50% of their value, he'll jump in.

The sixth edition of Merriam-Webster's ""Official Scrabble Players Dictionary"" includes 300 words such as twerk, beatdown and sriracha. And it finally adds a common two-letter word that players have been waiting to use for decades: OK. ""For a living language, the only constant is change,"" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large for Merriam-Webster. ""The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary evolves to keep up with English as it is used today."" The modernization of the game's lexicon can be seen in recently added words like bitcoin, facepalm and emoji.  Entries like sheeple (people who are docile and easily influenced) and listicle are derived from Internet lingo. ""Additions like these will add a new layer of fun to game night, making game play even more entertaining and relevant,"" said Jonathan Berkowitz, President of Hasbro Brands. ""Q"" words are always tough, especially those without a ""u"" in them. Players can monetize with the word qapik, which is a unit of currency in Azerbaijan. The updated version of the players dictionary continues to follow some of the game's most important rules. Words must still come from the standard dictionary. No abbreviations, capitalized words or words with punctuation are allowed. ""Scrabble has been a game night staple for 70 years, and we're excited to bring the game into its next decade,"" added Berkowitz.  Other words added include, yowza, macaron, zomboid (resembling zombies) and puggle. "
75,75,Tilray is having a wild week. Is this a bubble for cannabis stocks?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/20/investing/tilray-cannabis-stock/index.html,"Sep 20, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Tilray's moves have been wackier than anything Harold and Kumar experienced on their trip to White Castle or Seth Rogen and James Franco's adventures in ""Pineapple Express.""   Shares of Tilray (TLRY) have shot up nearly 50% in the past week, surging nearly 40% alone on Wednesday — a day when the stock was halted five times in the final 70 minutes of trading on the Nasdaq for volatility.   The stock was up more than 90% at one point Wednesday and also dived into negative territory before recovering. Shares remained volatile Thursday, alternating between double-digit gains and sizable losses. It was down about 20% in midday trading.   But following the moves of the past week, Tilray's market value is a staggering $16 billion. It is worth more than Molson Coors (TAP), Macy's (M), Tiffany (TIF) and casino giants MGM (MGM) and Wynn (WYNN).   Not bad for a company that just went public in July, isn't profitable and is only expected to generate sales of $41 million this year.   So why has Tilray, which is backed by Peter Thiel's venture capital firm Privateer Holdings, suddenly become a Wall Street darling?      The company's CEO, Brendan Kennedy, appeared on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" on Tuesday and told host Jim Cramer that cannabis is a ""great hedge"" for alcohol companies as more countries legalize recreational use of pot.   Kennedy also noted that cannabis is being viewed as a substitute for painkillers and other prescription drugs. So it might make sense for pharmaceutical firms to invest in cannabis.   To that end, Tilray also announced Tuesday that the US Drug Enforcement Administration had approved a plan for Tilray to import a cannabinoid capsule to America.   The drug will be used in a clinical trial at the University of California San Diego for the treatment of essential tremor, a neurological disorder.   Another drug company, UK-based GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), has already received approval from the FDA for the cannabis-based drug Epidiolex to treat seizures.   Shares of GW Pharmaceuticals were up 10% Thursday and are up nearly 20% in the past week. But Tilray and GW Pharmaceuticals aren't the only cannabis stocks that have been surging lately.      Canadian company Canopy Growth (CGC) has soared thanks to a $4 billion investment from Corona owner Constellation Brands (STZ) and plans for the companies to develop cannabis-based beverages.   Canada's Aurora Cannabis (ACBFF) surged this week, too, on reports that Coca-Cola (KO) is considering making cannabis infused drinks with it.   And Cronos Group (CRON) is up more than 30% in the past five days after it announced it was working with Canadian medical clinic company Aleafia Health (ALEAF) on a study that would use medical marijuana to treat insomnia and other sleep disorders.   Canada is set to legalize pot for recreational use next month as well. That's also fueling the surge in pot stocks.  This is a modal window.   But some experts worry that marijuana mania is another bubble in the making, just like dotcoms in the late 1990s, financial stocks in 2008 and bitcoin earlier this year. Those stories never end well.   Many short sellers, investors who bet that a stock will go down, are building big positions in Tilray and other cannabis stocks.   ""The cannabis rally may be on its last drags,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a research firm that focuses on short selling, in a report this week.   Even pot industry bulls are getting nervous.   Micah Tapman, managing director of CanopyVentures, a private equity firm focused on the cannabis industry that has invested in marijuana market research firm BDS Analytics, told CNNMoney investors are getting a little too optimistic about Tilray.   He said it's a classic case of FOMO — the fear of missing out. And he warns that unless the US legalizes marijuana for recreational use, the current prices of most pot stocks are now way too high.   ""There is no basis in reality for these valuations,"" Tapman said. ""They are not necessarily bad companies. But the projections are delusional."" "

Sean Russell's life savings were among them.   Russell rarely played the stock market and had little investing experience when he put around $120,000 into bitcoin in November 2017. He was stunned when that turned into $500,000 in just one month.   ""I think there was one morning where I woke up, where I made about £12,000 ($15,600) in one morning on my investment and it just kept going,"" said Russell. ""I was thinking, wow, that's mortgages paid, that's holidays that I've always dreamed of.""   The dream didn't last for Russell, who works as a property developer in the United Kingdom, buying homes and fixing them up. The price of Bitcoin surpassed $20,000 in December before collapsing. It now trades at $6,300.   Russell attempted to mitigate his losses by shifting money from bitcoin (XBT) to an offshoot called Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Ripple. But that didn't work, and Russell says the paper losses on his initial investment have reached 96%.   ""It was devastating, quite traumatic, really,"" Russell said. ""I've seen stories on the news of billionaires going bankrupt, and you think how can that be? How on earth did you lose that amount of money? And yet, here I am in that position.""     Russell is not alone.   Michel Rauchs, who researches cryptocurrency and blockchain at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, said the explosive rise in prices in 2017 attracted a wave of inexperienced investors.   ""Retail investors, students, housewives, even grandma was driven in by the hype,"" says Rauchs. ""They were told by the media that this was an opportunity of a lifetime. They bought at the top and are now sitting on heavy losses.""   The crash has left professional investors and enthusiasts debating where cryptocurrencies go from here.   ""Clearly the frenzy that we have seen and the volatility in the price of bitcoin ... resembles a lot of other financial bubbles that happen over and over again in our economic history,"" said Benedetto De Martino, a behavioral economist at University College London.   The fever that gripped cryptocurrency investors has faded in recent months. JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) have warned investors to stay away from bitcoin.   Last week, bitcoin prices plunged more than 20% in two days after Business Insider reported that investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) may be dropping plans to launch a crypto trading desk.   Goldman Sachs told CNNMoney it hadn't made a firm decision bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.   The Securities and Exchange Commission blocked several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the past few months, including plans from ETF giants ProShares and Direxion and one backed by the Winklevoss brothers.   Despite the warnings, some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs see the boom and bust as growing pains.   ""Markets are cyclical and there's still a lot of opportunity for sophisticated investors,"" said Benjamin Dives, CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform London Block Exchange.   Before he first invested, Russell spent years tracking bitcoin and studying blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currencies. He said the learning process was like solving the plot of a murder mystery.   Despite the loss, he remains a committed investor.   ""I have to be hopeful about something,"" he said. ""I need to keep my mind occupied, because when I just focused on the money I lost, it destroyed me mentally and emotionally.""   — Anna Stewart contributed to this report. "
78,78,Russian accused of hacking the data of 80 million people extradited to US,http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/07/politics/hacking-russian-extradite-stolen-data-financial/index.html,"Sep 8, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Federal authorities on Friday announced the extradition of a Russian man who they say took part in an extensive computer-hacking campaign that included the largest theft of customer data from a US financial institution in history. Andrei Tyurin, 35, who was extradited from the country of Georgia, faces several charges stemming from the scheme, which targeted American financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news publishers, among other US companies, according to a statement from the Manhattan US attorney's office. Tyurin allegedly hacked one financial institution in Manhattan and came away with the personal data of more than 80 million people, officials said.   In all, more than 100 million customers had their information stolen as part of the extensive hacking Tyurin is suspected of engaging in from about 2012 to 2015, officials said. ""As Americans increasingly turn to online banking, theft of online personal information can cause devastating effects on their financial well-being, sometimes taking years to recover,"" Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement. ""Today's extradition marks a significant milestone for law enforcement in the fight against cyber intrusions targeting our critical financial institutions."" Tyurin was presented in court and remanded back into federal custody, according to Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office. Tyurin did not enter a plea, Biase said. Tyurin, who allegedly conducted the hacks with several others, also participated in a scheme where stocks were marketed ""in a deceptive and misleading manner"" in an effort to inflate the price, investigators said. Tyurin also used his hacking to help further an illegal gambling business, an illegal internet casino and international payment processors, which allowed other alleged thieves to process payments by credit or debit card, investigators said. This was done for illegal pharmaceutical distributors, purveyors of malicious or counterfeit ""anti-virus"" software, their own internet casinos and an illegal bitcoin exchange, according to the investigators. Tyurin and his co-conspirators made more than $18 million in profits, investigators said. Tyurin is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, one count of wire fraud, four counts of computer hacking, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to violate the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, officials said. ""Today's charges and extradition should serve as a lesson to all those who would conspire to engage in similar activity that the FBI and our partners will continue to bring these hackers to justice, regardless of where they may hide,"" said FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. "

Finding a safe harbor for your money in the short- to mid-term creates a challenging check list.   You want your money to take on more risk and earn you more than if it were just hanging out in your savings account, earning hardly anything. But you also want it to be relatively accessible on a five-year timeline.   The good news is you can cross a few things off your list right away. Like real estate.   ""When you're looking for liquidity and safety on a horizon of only five years, you don't want to be invested in a piece of real estate that you have to work desperately to get out of in a down market,"" says Derek Green, a broker and investment adviser with Titus Wealth Management in Folsom, California.   Also: Put down the cryptocurrencies.   Sure, there's potential for growth by investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, but the up and down swings in those markets make them too risky for a five-year span, according to Green.   ""Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile,"" says Green ""If it has had a period of downside volatility and you have to sell after five years, it isn't going to be a desirable situation.""   So what will keep your money growing with manageable risk in the next half decade?      Given the economic climate, the stock market remains among the best havens for your money. But some stocks may be safer than others, says Green.   ""The small- and mid-caps will likely have more of a tailwind given rising rates, a changing tax situation and trade tensions,"" says Green. ""Rather than the larger, internationally-oriented companies in the S&P 500.""   A small-cap, or a stock with a small ""capitalization"" as determined by the total market value of its shares, is stock of companies that generally have a market capitalization between $300 million to $2 billion. Mid-cap stocks are those between $2 billion and $10 billion. (Large cap stocks are those over $10 billion).   For those looking for something a little safer, Green recommends shorter maturity bonds or a short-term bond exchange traded fund. A shorter duration means less credit risk and less interest rate risk. And those are both good things in a rising interest rate market.      Looking beyond investments, Green advises finding somewhere other than your savings account for the money.   ""You're probably going to lag behind the rate of inflation in a savings account,"" he says.   Of course, there are high yield savings accounts available. While they tend to be among the safest options with the lowest risk, they offer the lowest returns. Use these only if security and accessibility to the funds is paramount.   Better than savings accounts are CDs, or certificates of deposit, which are insured, timed deposits offered by banks and credit unions that have very low risk, but offer slightly better returns than savings accounts.   ""CDs are getting more attractive as short-term interest rates increase.""   For example, a CD with a five-year term, might carry an annual percentage yield of 2.65%.      Given the relatively short time horizon and the dynamic economic picture, Green advises that you keep your eyes on that money and be a little more proactive with your investments than usual.   The reality is, he says, there are just too many things in play to leave your money alone for very long.   ""We may go from rising interest rates to falling interest rates during that five year cycle,"" says Green. ""I would recommend semi-annual to annual rebalancing of the portfolio.""

81,81,Justice Dept. announces charges against North Korean programmer for Sony hack,http://www.cnn.com/2018/09/06/politics/doj-sony-hack-charges/index.html,"Sep 6, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department announced cyber hacking charges against a North Korean national linked to the computer hacking of Sony in 2014, the WannaCry ransomware attack, and other significant cyber intrusions in a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.  North Korea has been linked to some of the most high-profile cyberattacks in recent years, and its hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment lead the Obama administration to impose economic sanctions against the country's government agencies and senior officials.  Thursday's announcement marks the first time US prosecutors have brought criminal charges against an official associated with the Sony breach and other attacks, with the DOJ targeting North Korean computer programmer Park Jin Hyok.  A Justice Department official said there has been no communication with the North Korean government about Park or any efforts to capture him.  The 172-page complaint, which includes one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, was filed in Los Angeles federal court on June 8, but Justice officials declined to say why it was unsealed Thursday. The officials did say, however, that the investigation is ongoing and while Park is the only individual charged at this time, the complaint makes clear that he worked with others. ""Today's announcement demonstrates the FBI's unceasing commitment to unmasking and stopping the malicious actors and countries behind the world's cyberattacks,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement. ""We stand with our partners to name the North Korean government as the force behind this destructive global cyber campaign."" The allegations in the complaint describe a ""wide-ranging, multi-year conspiracy (that) targeted computers belonging to entertainment companies, financial institutions, defense contractors, and others for the purpose of causing damage, extracting information, and stealing money."" The Treasury Department also announced Thursday that it is sanctioning Park, ""for having engaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity through the use of computer networks or systems against targets outside of North Korea"" on behalf of the government. ""We will not allow North Korea to undermine global cybersecurity to advance its interests and generate illicit revenues in violation of our sanctions,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. ""The United States is committed to holding the regime accountable for its cyber-attacks and other crimes and destabilizing activities.""   Treasury said it was also sanctioning the entity Park worked for, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, also known as Korea Expo Joint Venture or KEJV, and said it was controlled by the government of North Korea.   The Justice and Treasury departments also linked Park to the February 2016 cyber-enabled fraudulent transfer of $81 million from Bangladesh Bank and the ransomware used in the May 2017 ""WannaCry 2.0"" cyber-attack, which encrypted data on Microsoft computers across the world and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin cryptocurrency.   The Treasury announcement said that Park and his co-conspirators operated from ""North Korea, China, and elsewhere to perpetrate these malicious activities."" Asked if any of Park's attacks were launched from China by North Korea, a Justice Department official said, ""there's nothing in the complaint alleged on that."" The November 2014 cyber hack of Sony -- an attempt to block the release of the provocative comedy, ""The Interview,"" which involved an assassination plot of North Korean leader Kim Jung Un -- created an international crisis, filled with extortion attempts, threats to moviegoers and embarrassing leaks of executives' emails that included gossip about the lives of Hollywood celebrities and ultimately, the resignation of Sony Chairwoman Amy Pascal. ""We can't forget this was the cyber equivalent of a hostile foreign government dropping a bomb on the Sony Pictures lot in the middle of the night,"" said Josh Campbell CNN analyst and former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who assisted with the Sony investigation. ""Not only did the North Koreans burn down the Sony network, inflicting millions of dollars in damage, the attack was then followed by a campaign to instill fear among the American public.""  Lawmakers applauded the move.  ""Good,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It's been four years since North Korea's petty little despot hacked Sony Pictures because he didn't like a movie that a free and open society produced. It's been a year and half since he launched a ransomware attack that hit hundreds of thousands of computers across the globe. Kim showed the world both how small he was and how capable his cyber soldiers can be. Cyber war gives outsized opportunities to North Korea and it's important to push back."" ""This indictment is the result of years of hard work by the FBI and the Department of Justice, and it is an important step in making clear to our adversaries that these kinds of criminal activities are unacceptable. It also points to the need for a clearly thought-out and articulated strategy for deterring and punishing state-sponsored cyberattacks,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat. The North Korean government has repeatedly denied responsibility for the hack but called it ""a righteous deed."" Thursday's charges come on the same day that President Donald Trump praised the North Korean leader. ""Kim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims 'unwavering faith in President Trump.' Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!"" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. Jose Pagliery contributed to this report."
82,82,Bitcoin bloodbath: Cryptocurrency plunges 20% in two days,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/06/technology/bitcoin-prices-plunging-goldman-sachs/index.html,"Sep 6, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies have suffered similarly large drops. The reason for the latest pullback? A Business Insider report that investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) may be dropping plans to launch a crypto trading desk.   Goldman Sachs told CNNMoney though that it hadn't made a firm decision about bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies just yet.   ""In response to client interest in various digital products, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space. At this point, we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering,"" Goldman Sachs said in a statement.   But if Goldman Sachs is pulling back, that is not good news.   Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with ThinkMarkets UK who is bullish on bitcoin, said in an email that ""there is no doubt that the bitcoin price is supported by this hype that institutional banks are going to get involved.""   Stories first surfaced about a possible Goldman Sachs push into bitcoin (XBT) and other cryptocurrencies last December, shortly after the two big futures trading companies -- the CBOE (CBOE) and CME (CME) -- set up exchanges for bitcoin contracts.   Goldman Sachs confirmed in May that it was thinking of using its own money to start trading bitcoin, according to the New York Times.   Bitcoin prices, which were hovering near a record high of about $20,000 in December, have lost more than two-thirds of their value since then and are currently trading at around $6,400.   Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at currency brokerage FXTM, said in a report Thursday that it's possible prices could fall below $5,000.   So it might make sense for Goldman Sachs to take a more cautious approach to this extremely volatile market. Most of the news about bitcoin has been negative lately.   Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned some cryptocurrency ads.   The Securities and Exchange Commission blocked several proposals for bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the past few months, including plans from ETF giants ProShares and Direxion and one backed by the Winklevoss brothers of Facebook fame.   Several publicly traded companies have also tried to latch onto the crypto craze, leading to more concerns that bitcoin could be a bubble. Overstock (OSTK) has de-emphasized much of its struggling online retail business to focus on cryptocurrencies.   Bioptix, a maker of hormones for farm animals, changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT). The stock surged -- until the company disclosed the SEC was probing it.   Beverage company Long Island Iced Tea morphed into Long Blockchain (LBCC). It's since been delisted by the Nasdaq and now trades as a so-called bulletin board stock at a price below 20 cents a share.   Some companies also began selling digital tokens through initial coin offerings to raise money.   Eastman Kodak  (KODK)-- yes, the camera and film company -- created its own KodakCoin. There's even a PotCoin for the legal marijuana and cannabis industry.  This is a modal window.   Many of these initial coin offerings are legitimate. But there have been scams too. The SEC even created a fake ICO called HoweyCoins to show how easy it is for investors to get duped.   And several titans of business have blasted bitcoin as well.   JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that was only good for drug dealers and North Korea.   Billionaire investor Saudi Prince Alwaleed, whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL), Citigroup (C) and Twitter (TWTR), told CNBC late last year he thought bitcoin was an ""Enron in the making"" that will implode.   Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) have also warned investors to stay away from bitcoin.   Buffett told CNBC in early May bitcoin was ""probably rat poison squared"" while Munger said at the Berkshire shareholder meeting that the thought of owning cryptocurrencies was ""just dementia.""   It's also worth noting that the recent plunge in bitcoin comes at a time when the Turkish lira, Indian rupee and Argentine peso are in freefall mode as the dollar strengthens.  This is a modal window.   So investors don't seem to be willing to bet on bitcoin as a replacement for fragile emerging markets currencies.   Still, the pullback in bitcoin comes even as more and more businesses and organizations have embraced blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.   IBM (IBM) is a big proponent of the blockchain. The World Bank has announced plans to launch a blockchain bond. There's even a company that wants to run a fantasy football league using blockchain. (Call me old school. But I'll stick with Yahoo for my league.)   There is a clear difference between bitcoin and blockchain. The future of money may still very well be digital, but that doesn't mean that bitcoin or the scores of other virtual currencies out there will all survive and thrive.   -- CNNMoney's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.

83,83,"Move over, Intel. AMD rules in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street",http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/24/news/companies/amd-best-stock-lisa-su/index.html,"Aug 24, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   AMD stock has more than doubled this year and is trading at a nearly 12-year high. That makes AMD the best performer in the S&P 500. AMD (AMD) recently passed heart pump maker Abiomed (ABMD) to take over the top spot.   AMD's gains are partly coming at the expense of semiconductor giant Intel (INTC), whose stock is only up about 2% this year on concerns about lower profit margins and possible product delays.   Intel is also reeling from the scandal that led to the resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich two months ago. (He had an improper relationship with an employee.)      But what's really interesting about AMD is that it is benefiting from increased demand for PCs. Yes. PCs! Even though we live in a smartphone world, lots of businesses still need PCs and AMD's Ryzen chips have been taking market share from Intel.   AMD's surge is being led by CEO Lisa Su -- one of the few women CEOs in tech, let alone Corporate America.   Su, a veteran of tech giants Freescale (now owned by NXP (NXPI)), IBM (IBM) and Texas Instruments (TXN), joined AMD in 2012 and was named CEO in 2014.   With Su on board, AMD has strengthened its ties with the big PC companies. She said in a conference call with analysts after its most recent earnings report last month that ""we have great relationships"" with companies like Dell, HP (HPQ) and Lenovo (LNVGF).   Su added that many of these and other laptop makers have sold out of products using AMD chips. She said the company has quickly restocked and expects that it will have a larger presence in the PC market for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.   Under Su's watch, AMD also became a bigger player in gaming and is benefiting from the boom in the gaming market. Its Radeon graphics cards are important components for consoles made by Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) as well as PC games.   The gaming business has been a huge positive for AMD rival Nvidia  (NVDA)as well. Nvidia's shares have also been a market darling, surging nearly 40% in 2018 and more than 1,000% over the past three years.   Graphics processors are also important for cyrptocurrency mining, although both AMD and Nvidia have recently said that demand in the crypto market has started to wane following a huge plunge in the price of bitcoin this year.   But Wall Street is clearly impressed with what Su has done at AMD over the past few years.   ""Lisa Su's understated and strong leadership along with consistent messaging to investors/customers has garnered significant accolades,"" said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann in a report this week.   Mosesmann upgraded his price target for AMD to $30. That's the highest on Wall Street and 30% higher than its current price.      But the next big task for AMD may be stepping up its advertising in order to further take advantage of some of Intel's problems. Intel made a big name for itself with its Intel Inside marketing campaign.   Su told analysts in July there's no reason AMD can't be a more recognizable company for consumers either. She said the company is very focused on boosting awareness for both the Ryzen and Radeon brands.   And if all that works out, Su could find herself as head of a Fortune 500 company at this time next year.   AMD came in at 506 in the magazine's most recent ranking, which is based on annual sales. Analysts are forecasting a revenue jump of more than 25% for AMD in 2018. "
84,84,Over FAANG? Tech investors should focus on these stocks next,http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/15/investing/markets-now-tech-investing/index.html,"Aug 15, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Matt McCall, founder and president of Penn Financial Group, says Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG) are all good bets for the long-term.   But recently, the celebrated stocks have gotten hammered. McCall thinks investors may have a good opportunity to buy up some shares if the pull back in the next week or two.   ""I prefer some of the small-, mid-cap companies in some of the niche areas such as AI or self-driving cars,"" he told CNN's Alison Kosik on ""Markets Now"" on Wednesday. ""I think that's the future of technology.""   McCall also pointed to three stocks he's favoring in particular: Teladoc (TDOC), which lets patients video-chat with doctors, Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA), a gene-editing company, and Sensata Technologies (ST), which make sensors used in smart devices.      And McCall is betting on bitcoin — even as the cryptocurrency keeps falling.   ""You have to be a certain type of investor to be able to stomach [the wild swings],"" he said. In late December, bitcoin hit an all-time high of just under $20,000. Today, it's hovering around $6,500.   ""If you're considering cryptocurrencies or if you've been in them before, I think this is a great opportunity,"" McCall said.   ""I love them long term,"" he added. ""I do believe the technology behind cryptos, which is blockchain, will change the way that every industry is going to be doing business in the decades ahead.""     He added that cryptocurrency's critics remind him of people who dismissed the internet as just a way to access email.      McCall also has his eye on another controversial stock, electric-car maker Tesla.   CEO Elon Musk shocked Wall Street last week when he announced on Twitter that he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. He said he had ""funding secured"" for a deal, but didn't say where the money would come from.   On Monday, he said the financing referred to talks he has had with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Then on Tuesday, the Tesla board said it wasn't clear yet that going private made sense.   McCall thinks there's about a 95% chance that Musk will make good on his promise.   ""I may buy today,"" he said. ""Getting it at $420, $425 is a heck of a deal for whoever's going to put the money up and take this company private.""

When the Crown League launches next year, fans will be able to buy a stake in any of its 12 teams and share in any profits they earn during the season. Each team will be led by a general manager, who will field weekly rosters of players selected by professional pickers.   Now, you may think this is just another case of a tech-savvy entrepreneur trying to generate a little hype for his startup by throwing around the buzziest of buzzwords. But Dan Nissanoff, the 52-year-old businessman behind the idea, says the blockchain will allow for decentralized team ownership and transparency.   ""We're using it to create an immutable record of the contests,"" said founder Dan Nissanoff, 52. ""This could literally have never been done before the blockchain.""   Related: These startups are trying to save local news   A blockchain is essentially a public digital ledger of transactions that can't be changed. It's most associated with powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but it can be applied to other areas, such as health care, voting or ... sports.   For The Crown League, these transactions include tallying team standings and results and serving as a record of things like team payouts and ownership stake.   Blockchain technology is certainly having a moment but many experts caution against trying to use it for every situation.   ""Someone who says blockchain can be used to solve problem x, doesn't understand the problem,"" says Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at The International Computer Science Institute.   Weaver also notes that blockchain technology isn't new; it's just having a major moment and everyone wants to launch something using it.   Related: IBM's blockchain app store wants to help banks cut costs   Nearly 60 million people played fantasy football last year, according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association. But there isn't one central league: Players take part in thousands of leagues, from those that exist online to informal leagues among friends.   That's where Nissanoff saw an opportunity to create one league that would bring fans together and give them a place to share their passion.   Nissanoff also notes that unlike with other pro leagues, fans of Crown League can actually profit themselves when a team does well. Fans who invest also get some say in how the team is run -- they can decide to get rid of general managers who don't fit the bill.   He said it's already raised money from investors and partnering with big names in the sports and tech worlds, but it declined to comment on with whom it's working.   Crown League will also sell security ""tokens,"" digital assets that are federally regulated, so anyone will be able to own portions of either a league or teams. League tokens go on sale this week for $1. Nissanoff said the company eventually plans to launch tokens that the general public can buy. "
86,86,Remember Overstock? It's basically a crypto company now,http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/10/technology/overstock-blockchain-bitcoin-investment-earnings/index.html,"Aug 10, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   But the company doesn't think that matters. Overstock is going all in on blockchain and cryptocurrencies.   Shares of Overstock (OSTK) surged more than 15% on Friday after the company announced an investment of almost $375 million from GSR Capital, a Hong Kong private equity firm.   Overstock wants to be more than just an also-ran in online retail. To jump-start growth, it is investing heavily in blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.   The company has a cryptocurrency unit called tZERO as well as a subsidiary named Medici Ventures that invests in blockchain companies.      The dramatic rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a big reason Overstock is pushing forward with blockchain deals and de-emphasizing the retail business.   But that's not without risk. Shares of Overstock have been riding the bitcoin (XBT) wave for the past year. The stock has soared more than 130% over the past 12 months, but it has plunged nearly 30% in 2018.   Regulatory scrutiny is a concern, too. Overstock disclosed in March that the Securities and Exchange Commission is ""conducting an investigation"" into its plans to launch an initial coin offering, or ICO, for tZERO. Overstock said that it is cooperating with the SEC.   Still, the endorsement from GSR for Overstock's cryptobusiness is a big win. Specifically, GSR will invest $270 million in tZERO. The rest will be in shares of Overstock.   GSR also plans to buy $30 million in tZERO security tokens, a form of crypto investments backed by partial ownership of other assets such as stock and bonds.   Overstock said that the GSR deal values tZERO, which is 80% owned by Medici Ventures, at $1.5 billion. That's a little bit higher than Overstock's current market valuation.   GSR Capital said it was eager to work with tZERO to expand blockchain-enabled asset trading, including stocks, bonds and commodities.      In a letter to shareholders, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne acknowledged that ""recently an investor lamented to me that Overstock is among the most difficult-to-value stocks on Wall Street.""   Byrne called that ""regrettable"" but stressed that the crypto-related units could justify a higher price. He wrote that it is ""becoming increasingly important to elucidate the different parts of our business and their potential value.""   Byrne also hinted in the shareholder letter that Overstock will start to spend less on its retail unit as a way to stem the company's overall losses.  This is a modal window.   ""Given the rapidly growing value of our non-retail assets, we think shareholders are better served now by a cash-conservative strategy. I believe Overstock can focus on developing more non-traditional means of growth and profitability,"" he said.   Byrne added that the company is still looking for a possible buyer of the retail business, and that ""discussions with potential buyers have progressed.""   So it makes strategic sense for Overstock to move more heavily into crypto.   Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson, thinks that its blockchain business should account for nearly 60% of the company's overall value. He has a buy rating on Overstock and raised his price target Friday to $112 a share Friday. That's nearly 150% higher than the current price.  This is a modal window.   Even as Overstock faces issues regarding its blockchain business and lackluster returns from online retail, the company is looking to expand into yet another market — real estate.   The company announced last month it was relaunching Houserie, a real estate property management site it bought in February.   The site will be geared toward landlords with services like background checks for potential tenants and rent payment management. Overstock said Houserie will become part of a broader O Real Estate platform that will launch in September and include more information for renting, buying and managing properties. "

Blockchain is best known as the technology underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It serves as a digital record of financial transactions.

Moving the process to the blockchain could cut costs and speed up trading for both bond issuers and investors.

88,88,West Virginia to introduce mobile phone voting for midterm elections,http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/06/technology/mobile-voting-west-virginia-voatz/index.html,"Aug 6, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The state's decision to pioneer mobile voting comes even as the United States grapples with Russian interference in its elections. A recent federal indictment outlined Russia's attempts to hack US voting infrastructure during the 2016 presidential race, and US intelligence agencies have warned of Russian attempts to interfere with the upcoming midterm election.   Still, West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner and Voatz, the Boston company that developed the app, insist it is secure. Anyone using it must first register by taking a photo of their government-issued identification and a selfie-style video of their face, then upload them via the app. Voatz says its facial recognition software will ensure the photo and video show the same person. Once approved, voters can cast their ballot using the Voatz app.   Ballots are anonymized, the company says, and recorded on a public digital ledger called blockchain. Although that technology is most often associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it can be used to record all manner of data.   Voatz is one of several companies exploring mobile balloting and recording votes on the blockchain. So far the technology has been limited to trial runs and private elections, such as balloting for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.   West Virginia will limit the use of Voatz largely to troops serving abroad. ""There is nobody that deserves the right to vote any more than the guys that are out there, and the women that are out there, putting their lives on the line for us,"" Warner said.   Related: DNC warns candidates: Don't use ZTE or Huawei phones   Officials tested Voatz in two counties during the primary election earlier this year with financial backing from Tusk Montgomery Philanthropies. Warner's office said four audits of various components of the tool, including its cloud and blockchain infrastructure, revealed no problems.   Still, state officials will leave a final decision on using the app in November to each county, Michael L. Queen, Warner's deputy chief of staff, told CNN.   Warner told CNN he is not calling for the replacement of traditional balloting, and said troops can cast paper ballots if they like. But Voatz co-founder and CEO Nimit S. Sawhney sees the state as a springboard to broader use of the technology.   Not everyone shares his enthusiasm.   ""Mobile voting is a horrific idea,"" Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told CNN in an email. ""It's internet voting on people's horribly secured devices, over our horrible networks, to servers that are very difficult to secure without a physical paper record of the vote.""   Marian K. Schneider, president of the election integrity watchdog group Verified Voting, was even more blunt. Asked if she thought mobile voting is a good idea, she said, ""The short answer is no.""   Related: Can this technology modernize how we vote?   Even if the Voatz app is secure -- something Schneider said she could not confirm because her organization has not vetted it -- the ""attack area is much broader"" under mobile voting, meaning it creates far more opportunities for hacking and meddling. She also worries about the lack of a paper trail for electronic votes. ""Undetectable changes that could occur in transit,"" she said.   Warner is no neophyte to the need for security, and his efforts to secure the state's voting infrastructure earned praise last month from Matthew Masterson, a senior Department of Homeland Security official. Warner has lobbied the agency to share any information that might help states mitigate election meddling. He's even gone so far as to recruit the state National Guard in his fight against election interference.   Charles Stewart III, who teaches political science at MIT, said that although he doesn't consider mobile voting ready for ""prime time,"" he credited West Virginia for being ""the bold ones"" testing the technology. ""There is something to be said sometimes for small scale pilots where we can learn the trade-offs,"" he said.   November will provide just such a test. Supporters and skeptics of mobile voting will be watching closely. "

Now the Seattle icon sports the world's first revolving glass floor. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Venezuela attack Six people have been arrested in connection with what Venezuelan officials call an assassination attempt on President Nicolas Maduro. The attack happened over the weekend as Maduro was giving a speech during a military parade. A pair of drones loaded with explosives flew right toward him. Live footage of the event showed Maduro suddenly looking up startled midspeech, while beside him his wife, Cilia Flores, winced after a loud bang and dozens of soldiers were seen scattering. Authorities were able to knock the drones off course and caused them to detonate away from Maduro. Appearing on TV a few hours later, Maduro blamed the attack on the far right in Venezuela and Colombia, outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Venezuelans living in the US. Venezuela has been gripped in chaos for a while now, with food and medicine shortages, soaring prices, political instability and violence causing thousands to flee the South American nation. 2. Russia investigation Did President Trump admit in a tweet that the 2016 Trump Tower meeting was never about Russian adoptions, as Team Trump has always maintained, and instead was just about getting dirt on Hillary Clinton? It seems so. The President was tweeting out his displeasure with reports that he's worried about son Donald Trump Jr.'s legal exposure in the Russia investigation. (He says he's not worried.) Then he wrote that the purpose of that meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics."" That pretty much contradicts everything the President and his team have previously said. CNN's Chris Cillizza says Trump is ""twisting himself in knots"" trying to explain the Trump Tower meeting.  3. Indonesian earthquake At least 91 people were killed when a 6.9-magnitude earthquake and strong aftershocks hit the Indonesian resort islands of Bali and Lombok. About 200 people were injured, but the number of victims is expected to rise. It was the second big quake on Lombok in a week. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake shook the island July 29, killing more than a dozen people and briefly stranding hundreds of hikers on the slopes of a volcano. 4. NRA Is the NRA in danger of shutting down? The influential gun advocacy organization claims it is -- if the state of New York keeps it from doing business with financial companies. In a lawsuit filed in May and amended in July, the NRA accuses New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of trying to stop banks and insurers from dealing with the gun rights group. The NRA says it will have to close its headquarters, shutter its internet presence and stop holding rallies if this doesn't stop. Cuomo said the state won't be ""intimidated by the NRA's frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda."" New York has filed a motion to dismiss the case, and a hearing is scheduled for next month. 5. Hawaii It's been a rough 2018 for the Aloha State. The year started off with that false missile alert in January. Then the Kilauea volcano started erupting on the Big Island back in May (and it may keep rumbling for years). Now the state is keeping a wary eye on a hurricane. Hurricane Hector is currently a category 4 storm. While it's expected to pass just south of the Big Island by midweek, it'll still be close enough to affect the islands. Gusty winds, rough surf, coastal flooding, and rip currents are possible, the National Weather Service says, so residents are encouraged to dust off those emergency plans, just in case.

The company announced on Wednesday that it's teaming up with Microsoft and Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, to let customers use cryptocurrencies to buy items in stores.   The companies are working on a platform called Bakkt to allow users to store digital currency and trade it for products. Starbucks won't store or accept the cryptocurrency directly, but Bakkt will turn people's digital currency into US dollars that can be used at the coffee chain.   Starbucks said the move is part of an effort to stay innovative and offer customers more ways to pay.   Bitcoin (BTSC), the first currency that'll be available on Bakkt, is a buzzy alternative currency, but its rise in popularity has been far from stable. Late last year, the value of one bitcoin was as high as $20,000, but it's currently priced at just over $7,400. People can also purchase a fraction of a bitcoin.   Bakkt is expected to launch in November, and it's unclear when Starbucks will be able to implement the technology for customer use. The platform will also be available for other merchants to use.

The trendy technology is known for powering cryptocurrencies, but IBM hopes it can help financial services companies use it to cut down on operating expenses and fees.   Blockchain serves as a digital ledger or record of financial transactions. Past entries can't be changed and new ones are added in real time. Because the information is shared by multiple entities, it's difficult for others to change or manipulate the data, making it incredibly secure.   IBM's new app store, LedgerConnect, gives financial companies access to seven vetted blockchain vendors, which will help them streamline their trading processes and back-end operations by establishing one set of records. Right now, most banks operate their own individual systems, which is really expensive.   The company said banks, including Barclays and Citi, are already taking part in the program.   While some blockchain networks are public, like bitcoin, IBM is working with financial firm CLS, which settles transactions in foreign currencies, to keep it private.   Related: These startups are trying to save local news   According to Keith Bear, IBM's vice president of global financial markets, this approach was crucial to the process because a private network ensures sensitive banking transactions are protected.   The blockchain app store may help banks solve a very expensive problem.   According to a 2016 Goldman Sachs report, up to 10% of trades are subject to mistakes that cause costly delays. The report states blockchain technology could save financial institutions around the world between $11 and $12 billion annually by reducing the number of mistakes that result in fees and higher operating costs.   IBM's Bear calls the app store ""a starting point."" The company said new institutions and blockchain technologies will be added soon. "

She is a former staff journalist at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and a former technology policy adviser at the US State Department. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)A cornerstone of American democracy is faith in elections to deliver a fair result. Today, that trust is under threat. Most recently, 12 Russian agents were indicted over interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.  How do we ensure Americans' belief in the vote?  One option is to put votes on a blockchain, which is a kind of record keeping. Blockchain's most famous application is bitcoin, the digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, or distributed ledger, that is verified by computers around the world. The bitcoin blockchain allows money to travel around the globe without the help of a bank or a government. The cryptography behind blockchain makes it difficult to tamper with it without someone noticing. This is why some refer to blockchain as a ""truth machine.""  Blockchain is now being applied to everything from humanitarian aid to supply chains -- and many industries that want a record that resists the interference of a third party. In May, West Virginia became the first state to use blockchain in a federal election. A limited number of absentee military, or Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, voters used a blockchain-based mobile application. This was intended to be safer and more convenient than mailing in an absentee paper ballot.  ""Whether a Soldier is without mail service in the mountains of Afghanistan, or a Sailor is in a submarine under the polar icecap, they deserve the opportunity to participate easily in our democracy,"" said West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican.  Blockchain was an attempt to keep those mobile votes secure. Absentee voters cast their ballots via their smartphones, and then their votes were recorded on a blockchain -- in addition to a traditional cast vote record. The results of the vote are still under audit, but if all goes well, in the midterm elections, West Virginia will bring blockchain voting to UOCAVA voters in the state's 55 counties. ""Blockchain is becoming more and more attractive for people who are looking for a transparent and immutable record -- that is something that can be audited,"" Donald Kersey, elections director and deputy legal counsel at the West Virginia secretary of state's office, told me. Kersey said there wasn't much opposition to the pilot, in part because it was so limited in size. West Virginia has not publicized exactly how many voters participated in the pilot, but Kersey acknowledged it was not a large number.  Kersey noted that in West Virginia, all voting machines have a backup paper record, or a ""voter verified paper trail,"" as do many other states. ""For those that don't,"" he said, ""I doubt blockchain is the best answer -- mainly because it would require connection to the internet."" So, while blockchain might help mobile voting become more secure, Kersey doesn't foresee blockchain becoming part of the voting machine discussion anytime soon.  If West Virginia extends blockchain voting to UOCAVA voters in all 55 counties, the pushback could increase. ""There are always concerns about the unknown,"" Kersey said. ""The word 'pioneer' is most applicable here. Lewis and Clark had no idea what was west of the Mississippi.""  As for the voters themselves, many probably didn't even know that the system used blockchain. While I was not able to get direct access to the voters who participated in the pilot, some appeared to appreciate the convenience. ""I've been living in Japan for 17 years, and I've missed a lot of stuff stateside,"" one person who successfully voted told Voatz, the startup that worked on the West Virginia blockchain pilot. ""This system gives me an opportunity to engage again with so much ease."" Blockchain technology appeals to those who trust math more than human beings. Nimit Sawhney, CEO of Voatz, explains that for a computer to add any data to the blockchain, it has to first solve a difficult puzzle. The puzzle is hard to solve, but easy for other people to check. ""You can't cheat math,"" he told me. ""One plus one is two."" In a blockchain, every block is mathematically linked to the one before it. ""Let's say you found a way to tamper with the most recent transaction,"" Sawhney said. ""You have to tamper with everything before it, and remain undetected, before the next vote comes in. You would need to do it in a fraction of a second."" This would make it very difficult for Russians, for example, to hack a blockchain. ""Even with the most powerful computer they have, it would take 25 years to hack one vote."" In the case of West Virginia, military voters first verified their identity via government-issued IDs and face recognition. They cast their votes via Android or iPhones, and then those votes were stored on a blockchain.  The West Virginia blockchain did not use bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Unlike bitcoin, which is decentralized and open to everyone, in West Virginia only nodes with permission could participate. Nodes are computers that cryptographically verify updates to a blockchain.  Sawhney says that in the very near future, stakeholders, such as voters, independent auditors, nongovernmental organizations and all major political parties can apply to become a node. While some will still criticize this kind of blockchain for not being fully decentralized, having multiple political parties verifying the blockchain might help assuage fears that one party will unduly influence the process.  Sound too good to be true? Some think it is. ""How do you know that the votes you put on the keyboard of your phone get on the blockchain?"" asked Stanford University computer science professor David Dill.  By involving Android or Apple phones, you are giving Silicon Valley companies even more power than they already have. ""Suppose there's a group of programmers at Google. They have strong opinions about who should be elected for office, and no scruples,"" Dill told me. ""I don't want Apple to decide who the president is. I don't want Google to decide who the president is."" Many Americans don't trust the government, but some trust Silicon Valley even less. Josh Benaloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research, echoed Dill's concern. ""If my vote is changed by malware before it ever reaches a blockchain, I will likely never know it, and the blockchain offers me no protection.""  Pete Martin, CEO of Votem, a blockchain voting startup that is exploring the possibility of doing midterm elections in Montana, told me that it has already accounted for this problem. ""We assume you have malware on your phone or desktop,"" Martin said. ""When you cast your vote, that cast vote record has a mathematical proof around this encrypted package. By the time that our servers get it, we check to see if anything was changed in that packet. ... If it was changed, we'll reject your vote.""  It's good that people are raising questions about blockchain. If states apply it to something as critical as elections, they'd better get it right. But it's clear that something must be done. Perception matters. If Americans lose faith in elections, democracy will suffer. Everyone in the elections world wants what's best for the voter and the votes, Kersey said. ""Whether you're Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter. I don't think that anybody is going to put a wall up against something that works, that is secure."" "

""Overstock has connected customers with premium home goods, helping them build their dream homes; now, we look forward to expanding those services in the real estate industry,"" said Seth Moore, Overstock's senior vice president of strategy, in a statement.   It's unclear if investors will applaud the move.   It's not as if Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) or Amazon (AMZN) is trying to manage properties. The real estate business is much different than selling home furnishings.   But Moore said in an email to CNNMoney that Overstock was not taking on real estate risk with the move.

Moore said the site will help people who are searching for a new house or are in the process of relocating, while also selling them furniture to match their new home ""more seamlessly.""   This isn't the first time Overstock has made a move into the real estate business. It set up a real estate search site in 2008, only to close it down in 2011.   But the renewed push into real estate is yet another example of how Overstock is trying to diversify beyond retail, particularly through bitcoin.   Related: Forget bitcoin. Here come the blockchain ETFs   Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne is a cryptocurrency bull. Overstock was one of the first retailers to accept bitcoin.

Shares of Overstock (OSTK) have been riding the bitcoin wave for the past year. The stock is up more than 135% over the past 12 months but it has plunged nearly 40% so far in 2018.   Overstock's bitcoin moves have also made the stock even more vulnerable to attacks from short sellers, investors who profit when a stock goes down.   Short sellers borrow a stock and sell it, with the hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.   Overstock has often been a favorite stock for shorts to target. Byrne was even featured in a ""60 Minutes"" segment in 2006 about short sellers.   And back in 2003, after Overstock reported strong holiday sales, Byrne told CNNMoney in an interview that ""when opportunities come along where we can knee the shorts in the groin, that's always good for fun and amusement.

Striving to turn the Mediterranean nation into ""Blockchain Island,"" the government is opening its doors to blockchain and other so-called distributed ledger technologies.   These technologies allow transactions to quickly be carried out between people without interference or control by third parties. Blockchain promises to improve security and reduces transaction costs.   Malta believes the island can become a haven for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin -- the most well-known application of ledger technologies -- but it also believes blockchain can help transform the country's transportation and education systems.      On July 4, the Maltese parliament passed three bills to set a regulatory framework and drive innovation in blockchain-like technologies. The government hopes these laws will attract foreign financial tech companies to establish themselves in the country.   The legislative win made Malta ""the first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space,"" the Maltese junior minister for financial services, digital economy and innovation, Silvio Schrembi, said in a tweet.   Analysts say the move shows Malta's trailblazing approach to blockchain.   ""Malta has accepted the fact that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are inevitably going to become more popular,"" said Joseph Borg, head of blockchain advisory at the WH Partners legal firm. ""By taking this step, Malta is destined to become a hub for innovative technology startups and established blockchain-based businesses to thrive, while creating economic growth on the island.""

Lithuania is also becoming a cryptocurrency hub, and Estonia was close to introducing a national digital currency called Estcoin. Outside of the EU, Switzerland has designated its canton of Zug as a ""Crypto Valley.""      But Borg said the difference lies in the approach. Although other countries are focusing on cryptocurrencies, Malta's attention is on the blockchain technology itself and its wider application.   ""Blockchain technology is a key part of our overall national technology strategy that will see us transform different sectors across government,"" said the Maltese minister for transportation.   In May, the government announced a partnership with a British blockchain platform, Omnitude, to improve the island's public transportation network.   Since 2017, it's been collaborating with Learning Machine Technologies on a pilot program to allow Maltese higher-education and vocational students to access and retrieve educational transcripts and records using blockchain technology.   And the country knows there's yet more potential in other sectors.

99,99,6 takeaways from the indictment of Russians for DNC hacking,http://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/politics/takeaways-indictment-russians-dnc-hacking/index.html,"Jul 14, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)The Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents on Friday was jaw-dropping in its scope and level of details into attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Here's what the indictment tells us:  The Russian government really, really wanted to beat Clinton Friday's indictment shows the lengths the Russians allegedly went to in order to defeat Hillary Clinton, thereby aiding Donald Trump's campaign. Their actions throughout 2016 resulted in multiple criminal charges, from identity fraud to money laundering conspiracy. To commit the alleged crimes, the Russians targeted more than 300 people affiliated with Clinton's campaign and Democratic political organizations, including the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta. Once inside the Democratic computers, they searched for keywords like ""Hillary,"" (then-GOP candidate Ted) ""Cruz,"" ""Trump"" and ""Benghazi investigations"" so they could steal the most damaging files. They wanted opposition research, campaign field operations and voter data, the indictment alleges. At one point the hackers even wrote to an organization that appears to be Wikileaks to coordinate release of the stolen documents. The group, listed only as Organization 1, responded that they thought Trump had a slim, ""no more than 25% chance"" of winning against Clinton so they found that conflict between Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders and Clinton was more ""interesting."" Fake names, stolen passwords and bitcoin The Russian hackers' scheme to steal thousands of documents from the Democrats, as described in the indictment, used simple but effective tools to breach their targets many times and in multiple ways. From Twitter and Facebook to WordPress, the hackers used the online services most ingrained in American society for posts that spread their illicit information. Even bitcoin, the electronic cash that's kept Silicon Valley abuzz, played a key role in the Russians' efforts to build their hacking infrastructure. ""The use of bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds,"" the indictment said. The hacking tools included emails disguised as Google security alerts containing bogus links and malware deposited on servers. Some were even transferred to a computer the foreign intelligence group leased in Illinois. They stole passwords, tracked keystrokes, took screenshots and watched banking information, the indictment said. And then, to spread the documents they collected, the Russians lied about their identity. At various times online, the conspirators claimed publicly they were American, then Romanian and had ""totally no relation to the Russian government."" Many of the 12 Russian intelligence officers used fake names online, showing that anyone could be behind that ""blablabla1234565"" handle. One hacker even chose Americanized names like ""Kate S. Milton,"" ""James McMorgans"" and ""Karen W. Miller"" to hide his foreign identity. DCLeaks.com, the domain operated by the hackers to post stolen documents, used the name ""Carrie Feehan,"" who wrongly appeared to be a New Yorker.  Voters are among the victims Among the hacking conspiracies described by prosecutors, one sticks out for how it attacked Americans regardless of their politics. The Russian military intelligence hackers snooped around online presences for state board of elections and county offices in Florida, Georgia and Iowa. They ultimately stole personal information like names, addresses, partial social security numbers and drivers' license numbers for about 500,000 voters. The indictment doesn't specify which state suffered that data breach.  The court case may go nowhere Like the criminal case against 13 Russians and three Russian companies that Robert Mueller's Office opened in February, don't expect these Russian spies-turned-hackers to show their faces before a judge. Not a single Russian person indicted by Mueller has shown up in a US court and they will likely continue to avoid international travel so they won't be apprehended. Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, and some lawmakers are calling on the US President to demand Russia turn over the indicted individuals. Only one Russian defendant so far, the company Concord Management and Consulting, sent US-based lawyers to plead not guilty to a charge from Mueller. That company has spent months wrangling access to evidence in the case after prosecutors accused them of trying to obtain the evidence as part of a foreign intelligence effort. The court has taken steps to thwart any sensitive national security leaks among the evidence collected. But aside from the court battle, the charges in the social media case and Friday's hacking indictment serve one major purpose: To shine a light on Russian officials' allegedly criminal attempts to hurt American democracy. There's more to come The indictment's section on how the Russian hackers interacted with Americans names several people who received the stolen documents. There was the US congressional candidate who asked for the material, the state lobbyist who received stolen personal identifications of 2,000 Democratic donors and the journalist who took a release of documents related to the Black Lives Matter movement. There's also Wikileaks, the main pipeline through which the Russians released their stolen goods.  And then there's Roger Stone Stone was an adviser to Trump during the campaign and has clearly been investigated by Mueller's team and the grand jury, after several of his business associates received requests for documents or to testify before the grand jury.

Robinhood Crypto has been steadily adding states where the service is available. Currently investors can buy and sell the four coins in 17 states, including California, New Jersey, Florida and Massachusetts, with more states becoming available in the future.   Robinhood began offering users the ability to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum — the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization — in February. Since then, investors have expressed interest in trading other cryptocurrencies, according to the company announcement.   Litecoin, the world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency, rose in value earlier this week on news that the Litecoin Foundation was partnering with payments platform TokenPay. Under the deal, the foundation received a 9.9% stake in WEG Bank in Germany. In return, Litecoin will aid in the development of TokenPay's cryptocurrency and business operations.   Last year Bitcoin Cash, currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, split from Bitcoin in a bid to return to an original vision of being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The result of a fork in the Bitcoin​ blockchain ledger, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes the ability to scale up and process transactions fast enough to be used for payments.   Robinhood's expansion into crypto, aimed at making trading cryptocurrencies easier and more accessible to investors, helped the company increase its reach to five million users across the platform. But all investors should be aware that investing in cryptocurrency is speculative and the market is generally unregulated.   Robinhood Crypto continues to offer users cryptocurrency market data and the opportunity to create price alerts for a total of 16 coins, including Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold, Lisk, and Dogecoin.

Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, XRP (aka Ripple) and Litecoin, have suffered similar gut-wrenching drops in the past few months.   Legendary investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) have warned investors to stay away from cryptocurrencies as a result.   Buffett told CNBC in early May bitcoin was ""probably rat poison squared"" while Munger said at at the Berkshire shareholder meeting that the thought of owning cryptocurrencies was ""just dementia.""   Bitcoin may eventually bounce back. Blockchain technology could still transform how people pay for things in the future.   Related: Is your bitcoin investment safe from crypto hacks?   But the scores of other cryptocurrencies that have cropped up in bitcoin's wake may not thrive -- or even survive.   ""The market did go up a little too much last year and people felt it was easy to make money. Investors weren't separating the good from the bad,"" said Ben Marks, CEO and founder of Blocktrade Capital, a firm that trades cryptocurrencies. ""But bitcoin is definitely here to stay.""   Cryptocurrencies' rise had all the signs of a bubble. Tons of publicly traded companies tried to latch onto the crypto craze.   Bioptix, a maker of hormones for farm animals, changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT). The stock surged -- until the company disclosed the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing it.   Beverage company Long Island Iced Tea morphed into Long Blockchain (LBCC). It's since been delisted by the Nasdaq and now trades as a so-called bulletin board stock at a price below 50 cents a share.   Making matters worse: Some companies began selling digital tokens to raise money.   Eastman Kodak (KODK) -- yes, the camera and film company -- created its own KodakCoin. There's even a PotCoin for the legal marijuana and cannabis industry.   Some of these so-called initial coin offerings are legitimate. But there have been plenty of scams too. The SEC created a fake ICO called HoweyCoins to show how easy it is for investors to get duped.   Related: Bitcoin prices have been manipulated, study says   The sheer number of crypto offerings is very similar to how Pets.com, Webvan, Garden.com and tons of other e-commerce stocks ultimately went under when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.   We didn't need hundreds of internet retailers. Even Amazon's shares were hit hard in the immediate wake of the tech bust because of concerns about its lack of profit and insane valuation.   But Amazon (AMZN) eventually started to make money as it expanded into more areas and got people to begin paying subscriptions for Prime memberships.   As Amazon became increasingly dominant, other big retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and Kroger (KR) adapted their business models so they too could get a piece of the digital pie.   That's been great for consumers -- and the shareholders of large brick and mortar retailers. But it shows that having an e-commerce strategy isn't special. Its a vital part of any retailer's strategy.   The same may ultimately be said for bitcoin and the blockchain.   Related: Forget bltcoin.

The hiring is another sign of the growth of digital currencies such as bitcoin, both as an investment and as part of the economy.   Cornish will start later this month. Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini's CEO, said he will help the company ""set the standards of excellence for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.""   The Winklevoss twins became known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg, whom they accused of stealing the idea for Facebook when they were all students at Harvard. The dispute was dramatized in the movie ""The Social Network.""   The twins settled with Facebook in 2008. The deal eventually gave them 6 million shares of Facebook, a stake worth more than $228 million at the time of its IPO. Facebook stock has since more than quadrupled.

106,106,Why the United States needs a cyber accord with North Korea,http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/opinions/united-states-cyber-accord-north-korea-intl/index.html,"Jun 27, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Troy Stangarone is the Senior Director for Congressional Affairs and Trade at the Korea Economic Institute of America.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN)US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to develop a new US-North Korea relationship during their historic summit in Singapore, but that won't be possible as long as Pyongyang continues to use cyberattacks against the United States and its allies.  If the relationship between the United States and North Korea is to be fundamentally reformed, North Korea's cyber activities must as well.  Each day, South Korea is believed to face an average of 1.5 million cyberattacks from North Korea, and a team of the country's hackers known as the Lazarus Group are believed to be the second-most active hacking operation in the world.  North Korea's technical sophistication has grown to the extent that North Korean coders have ranked among the best in the world in international competitions, allowing the regime to expanded beyond cyberattacks into the sale of facial recognition software, virtual private networks and encryption software to help generate revenue. Those transactions are usually conducted by front companies to help Pyongyang skirt United Nations sanctions.  North Korea has pursued these capabilities to address specific challenges confronting the regime. Pyongyang faces a significant military gap with its neighbors and cyber capabilities provide an inexpensive way to level the playing field against more powerful states. Hacking and cyber attacks are anonymous enough that they give North Korea a degree of deniability.  And North Korea's lack of connectivity gives the regime an asymmetrical advantage against more wired states, specifically the United States and South Korea, if they were to try to retaliate with cyberattacks of their own. A three-pronged strategy The development of North Korea's cyber capabilities has allowed it to pursue a three-pronged strategy: engage in traditional espionage activities, earn money and provide the regime with a tool to deter its adversaries.  We can see elements of each objective in North Korea's cyber activities.  The attack on Sony Pictures over ""The Interview"" in 2014 was designed to intimidate Sony and other studios. We saw that strategy succeed with Sony's decision to pull the movie from theaters and the cancelation of Steve Carell's North Korea-themed movie. The North has also engaged in espionage against South Korea. Attacks on South Korea's Ministry of Defense and military contractors resulted in the loss of a large number of classified documents, including partial wartime operations plans, and blueprints for a naval warship from Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. Hacking has also been especially helpful to North Korea as a means to evade sanctions and earn much-needed hard currency. North Korea has gone after traditional banks, including the cyberheist of $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, but more recently it's turning to cryptocurrencies.  The anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows the regime to avoid detection. Estimates indicate North Korea has hacked over 100 banks and cryptocurrency exchanges and to have successfully stolen $650 million, including the $530 million heist from Coincheck earlier this year. RELATED: Crypto hacks: Is your bitcoin investment safe? No change from the North The recent effort at détente with the United States and South Korea seems to have had little effect on North Korean behavior online.  Pyongyang is suspected of exploiting anti-terrorism drills by the South Korean National Counter-Terrorism Council in preparation for the Olympic Games to spread malware, while Cisco Systems recently revealed that a group tied to North Korea tried to use diplomatic summits as bait to install malware on South Korean computers. That sort of behavior could prove to be the undoing of any agreement with North Korea regarding its nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles. Much as the failure to address Iran's ballistic missile and alleged terrorist activities undermined support for the Iran nuclear deal, failure to address North Korea's cyber activities could undermine a nuclear agreement with Pyongyang. The best way to manage this would be to negotiate a cyber accord with North Korea that delineates what cyber activities would not be acceptable. Any agreement should be built around a set of principles that limit North Korea's cyber activities and move Pyongyang away from criminal behavior as opposed to more traditional espionage type activities in which many states engage. Among these, North Korea should agree to refrain from using cyberattacks as a form of retaliation against legal activities taken by private citizens and corporations.  Second, North Korea should end its attacks on the global financial system and refrain from resorting to cyber theft to steal hard currency.  Third, North Korea should agree that it will not support the theft of corporate intellectual property for competitive advantage or to sell to others for profit, as Washington and Beijing did in their cyber agreement. Lastly, North Korea should agree to not sell or provide its hacking services or software to third parties seeking to engage in the type of activities it has agreed not to engage in. While North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles represent a future threat to the United States, North Korea is already using cyberattacks against the United States and its allies. An accord that limited North Korea's cyber behavior to certain activities would help to support any nuclear agreement and to remove one more area of contention between the United States and North Korea.

That's one of the messages from a new report by an organization that represents dozens of the world's central banks.   The group, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said the ""intense interest"" in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had prompted it to look ""beyond the hype"" at what use they could actually contribute to the economy.   The report's authors were unimpressed, detailing a range of problems with trying to adopt cryptocurrencies as a widely used form of money.   They include the danger that just processing all the payments ""could bring the internet to a halt,"" said the report, which was published Sunday.   Related: Bitcoin prices have been manipulated, study says   A big part of the appeal of many cryptocurrencies to their supporters is that they are decentralized rather than tied to a central bank like the US Federal Reserve. Records of transactions are kept on a digital ledger.   But because every single transaction is added to the digital ledger, the report said using a cryptocurrency like bitcoin for retail transactions around the world would quickly swell the ledger beyond the capacity of computer servers to store it. Supercomputers would be needed to keep up with verifying incoming payments, and the huge amounts of data being exchanged between users would bring the internet to its knees.  This is a modal window.     Experts have warned previously about the vast energy demands that bitcoin could end up making if its use expands significantly.   The Bank for International Settlements pointed out other concerns about using cryptocurrencies as regular money, including the volatility of their prices. Bitcoin's price surged to around $19,000 late last year, but has since plunged to below $7,000.   Every bitcoin transaction also requires users to pay a fee to have it added to the digital ledger. In times of high demand, the fees go up. During the feverish trading of bitcoin in December, they spiked to around $57 per transaction.   ""Just imagine, if you bought a $2 coffee with bitcoin, you would have had to pay $57 to make that transaction go through,"" Hyun Song Shin, the bank's head of research, said in a video accompanying the report.   He noted that some people hold bitcoin not as money, but as an investment asset.   Related: Crypto hacks: Is your bitcoin investment safe?   The report also questioned the limits of the trust on which cryptocurrencies rely.   ""Trust can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralized consensus through which transactions are recorded,"" it said, adding that ""means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value.""   The report wasn't entirely dismissive.   It said that cryptocurrencies' ""underlying technology could have promise in other applications, such as the simplification of administrative processes in the settlement of financial transactions,"" although it added that ""this remains to be tested.""

""When the executives are selling in a big way, all at the same time, that can be a very negative signal for a stock,"" he said.   The new tax law, which lowered the corporate tax rate, sparked a wave of corporate buybacks -— but also more selloffs.

113,113,"Bitcoin prices have been manipulated, study says",http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/13/investing/bitcoin-blockchain-crypto/index.html,"Jun 13, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Tether, another digital currency tied to the US dollar, was used to artificially inflate bitcoin prices, according a study released Wednesday by the University of Texas.   John Griffin, a finance professor at the university, and graduate student Amin Shams analyzed blockchain purchases and discovered that major Tether buys were timed to follow market downturns and helped stabilize bitcoin's floor.   ""These patterns cannot be explained by investor demand,"" they said in the study.   Griffin and Shams have also recently found that the VIX, Wall Street's volatility index, was being manipulated.   A lawsuit filed in March cited their research to claim traders manipulated the value of VIX options and futures by making bets on the S&P 500 before VIX settlement auctions.   The price of bitcoin dropped 1% on Wednesday to around $6,485, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin's slump drove down other cryptocurrencies, including ripple, litecoin, and ethereum.   Bitcoin continued reeling days after a massive hack in South Korea. On Monday, South Korea's Coinrail said that it had been hacked and about 30% of its virtual currencies were stolen. South Korea is one of the biggest markets for crypto trading in the world.   Related: Crypto hacks: Is your bitcoin investment safe?   Over the past month, bitcoin has lost 25% of its value.   Retail buyers flooded the market late last year, lifting bitcoin to above $19,000 in December.

114,114,Crypto hacks: Is your bitcoin investment safe?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/13/investing/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-hacks-security/index.html,"Jun 13, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of digital currencies have been stolen by hackers in recent months. Experts say the problem is unlikely to go away anytime soon, and fears about security have hit prices this year.   In the latest incident, South Korean exchange Coinrail announced Monday that it had been targeted by cyberthieves, who stole about 30% of its virtual currencies.   ""I expect hackers to continue to target crypto exchanges,"" said Henri Arslanian, the head of financial technology in Asia at consultancy PwC. ""The rewards are high, and some of these exchanges grew so fast"" that they haven't yet implemented proper security, he added.   In January, Japanese exchange Coincheck said hackers stole more than $500 million worth of cryptocurrency. Last year, two bitcoin exchanges went bankrupt after falling victim to similar breaches.   Related: What is bitcoin?   That's just the tip of the iceberg, according to Yo Kwon, the CEO of Hosho Group, a Nevada-based company that specializes in securing applications that use blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   Kwon estimates that about a third of all cryptocurrency exchanges have been hacked at some point. And he predicts ""many more"" will suffer the same fate.      The spectacular rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year brought them widespread attention. Many of them have struggled in 2018: bitcoin has fallen more than 50%.   ""Investors have been increasingly worried about cybersecurity issues,"" said Adrian Lai, founding partner at Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency investment firm Orichal Partners. ""At this stage, obviously, the standard is not high enough.""  This is a modal window.     Authorities around the world have so far taken different approaches in their attempts to regulate virtual currencies. Some industry insiders say that complicates efforts to make exchanges more secure.   At one end, China has tried to ban trading in bitcoin. Japan, meanwhile, officially recognized bitcoin as legal tender last year and started licensing exchanges — but it took a tougher line after the Coincheck hack. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been increasing its scrutiny of digital assets.   ""Confused and concerned regulators periodically clamp down,"" prompting some exchanges to relocate elsewhere, said Eiland Glover, CEO of Tennessee-based blockchain company Kowala. This is ""not conducive to high security, or the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies,"" he added.      PwC's Arslanian said the people with most to lose from hacking incidents are mom-and-pop investors who are more likely to deposit their entire cryptocurrency savings with one platform out of convenience.   This makes them much more vulnerable to losing their investments in the event of a heist like those at Coinrail and Coincheck. (Coincheck said in March it had compensated its customers for their losses out of its own funds.)   Major investors — like banks and insurance funds — will probably be less concerned by these kinds of hacks, Arslanian added. That's because they can spread their risk across various platforms, as well as invest indirectly through derivatives and other avenues that are generally less accessible to regular investors.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned    Some experts say vulnerability to hacks is the result of the infancy of virtual currencies compared with more established assets like stocks and bonds.   ""The markets will probably adjust over time,"" said Hosho Group's Kwon.   He say the cryptocurrency industry will have to adapt and become more secure as an increasing number of big investors move in.   ""Exchanges that understand the increasing importance of security — for not only their longevity, but as a competitive advantage — will do better,"" Kwon said. "
115,115,The case of the curiously compelling Dennis Rodman-Chris Cuomo interview,http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/dennis-rodman-north-korea-chris-cuomo-cnntv/index.html,"Jun 12, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)There's a tendency when the name ""Dennis Rodman"" is uttered to immediately roll your eyes.  ""The Worm,"" as he was nicknamed during his days as a ferociously effective rebounder for the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls in the '80s and '90s, has become, over the intervening decades, sort of a dictionary definition of what happens when you struggle with alcohol addiction. Rodman, for much of the past decade, has been playing a stereotype of himself -- the brash, unpredictable provocateur. He's had a series of reality TV appearances -- including on Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" -- and, earlier this year, checked himself in to an alcohol rehab center.  Rodman has only been relevant in any meaningful way in politics during his seeming long, slow fade from celebrity with repeated trips to North Korea to meet with his self-professed ""friend"" Kim Jong Un. Rodman was lambasted for these trips in the past, accused of being used as a tool for a murderous dictator. He has responded, Rodman-like, badly -- savaging his critics including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Which brings me to Monday night -- and Rodman's interview from the Singapore summit between Trump and Kim, with CNN's Chris Cuomo. I'm not sure if it was my own admittedly low expectations or Rodman's performance -- or some of both -- but I found him not only totally compelling, but sympathetic as well. (Nota bene: Yes, I work for CNN. And, yes, I know Cuomo. Make of that what you will.) My re-assessment of Rodman actually began before he even appeared on screen. It came when former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said this about Rodman: ""He is a unique person since he has a relationship with both Kim Jong Un and with Donald Trump and obviously has great rapport with Kim Jong Un, who is a basketball fanatic himself. So I think that there is potential here to engage Dennis Rodman in a serious way in promoting this relationship."" I did a double take. I actually rewound the TV to make sure I heard it right. The former head of the DNI touting The Worm's diplomatic prowess? Whaaaaa? Then the Rodman interview began. And, yes, he was sort of all over the place. And, yes, he was undoubtedly flacking for a sponsor -- which appears to be a sort of Bitcoin for marijuana. But then Rodman started to recount his attempts to convince former President Barack Obama of Kim's willingness to make a deal as long as five years ago. And he started to cry. Here's the passage, from ""Cuomo Prime Time:""  ""It is amazing, it is amazing, when you said those things, when I said those damn things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats. I got so many death threats. I was sitting there protecting everything. And I believe that North Korea and when I went home, I couldn't even go home. I couldn't even go home. I had to hide out for 30 days. I couldn't even go home. But I kept my head up high, Brother. I knew things were going to change. I knew it. I was the only one. I never had no one to hear me. I never had no one to see me. But I took those bullets, I took all of that. I took -- everybody came at me and I'm still standing. And today is a great day for everybody, Singapore, Tokyo, China, everything, it's a great day."" Now. Simply because Rodman got emotional doesn't mean everything he said is accurate. His relationship with Kim is not even close to the relationship the average North Korean citizen has with Kim. In traveling repeatedly to North Korea pursuing basketball diplomacy, Rodman, with his actions and his words, seemed to cast a blind eye on the human rights violations and atrocities committed by and under Kim. That's not up for debate. And yet, the Rodman on TV Monday night was someone who desperately wanted to be seen, heard and acknowledged. Who believed he has something to give. Who, in his own flawed way, wanted to help.  In short: There's more to Dennis Rodman than the caricature he has cultivated both during and after his basketball career. No, that doesn't absolve him of his past comments or his past behavior. And, no Rodman isn't going to be leading our efforts to de-nuclearize the Korean peninsula.  But neither should he be solely the butt of jokes either. ""I saw a Dennis Rodman that I have never seen before on the course of that interview, and you drew that out of him,"" Clapper told Cuomo after the Rodman interview. ""A lot more depth there than I think meets the eye and he does understand Kim Jong Un, and all the rest of us, pundits, were kind of amateurs and haven't had that direct contact like he has."" Agreed. "

117,117,Are tech stocks about to come back to earth?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/investing/tech-stocks-nasdaq-apple-netflix-amazon/index.html,"Jun 12, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Wall Street, captivated by remarkable growth prospects in tech, has lifted the Nasdaq by 11% this year.   A third of the tech stocks in the S&P 500 have gained at least 20%. Favorites have been showered with even more love: Netflix (NFLX) has rocketed 90%, Twitter (TWTR) has soared 82%, and Amazon (AMZN) is up 45%. Not to mention Apple's (AAPL) 13% jump back to a record high.   But some analysts are warning that the market's fascination with these growth stocks could end, especially as the Federal Reserve gradually removes the easy-money punch bowl.    The ""biggest risk is a quick, deep tech sell-off,"" Michel Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote to clients on Friday.   The worry is that investors who are piling into tech stocks now will sell at the same time during market turmoil. Or that a scare like the user-data controversy that erupted at Facebook (FB) will start an investor exodus from the industry.   ""We remain defensive and happy to sell"" into market rallies, Hartnett said.   Related: Ben Bernanke warns this is the Wile E. Coyote economy   Of course, tech stocks are booming for good reason: These companies are making gobs of money. And they're disrupting entire industries.   ""Unlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a recent paper titled ""Why Technology Is Not a Bubble.""   Skeptics have wrongly called the end of the tech run before. The Nasdaq plunged 11% in just a few weeks this past winter before racing back to an all-time high.   Still, it's startling just how big some tech giants have become.   Amazon, Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL) have a combined market value of $2.5 trillion. That's enough to buy all 33 oil and gas companies in the S&P 500 energy sector — and still have $1 trillion left to scoop up JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).   Wall Street's love for tech stocks stands in stark contrast to the trouble in other corners of the market.   Slow-growing consumer staples stocks have tumbled 13% this year as they grapple with higher costs and shoppers' shifting tastes. Big names like General Mills (GIS), Campbell Soup (CPB) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) have fared much worse, plunging more than 20% apiece.   Some emerging markets have also gotten crushed, mostly by the stronger US dollar. Brazil's stock market has tumbled 16% this year, Argentina's has plunged 22%, and Turkey's is down more than a quarter.   And bitcoin is down by about half in 2018. The cryptocurrency shed another 7% on Monday following a cyberheist at an exchange.    ""We have been experiencing 'pop-up' thunderstorms in what I would call the weakest links in the capital markets,"" Morgan Stanley chief US equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients.   Related: Execs are cashing in on the explosion in stock buybacks   Wilson predicted a ""rolling bear market across asset classes, individual securities, sectors and regions.""   The turbulence has come as the Fed, encouraged by the stronger economy, steadily raises interest rates and shrinks its massive balance sheet. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates on Wednesday and again later this year.   The European Central Bank is likewise signaling it may begin to slow efforts to stimulate the eurozone economy by purchasing bonds. That program, known as quantitative easing, or QE, has boosted stock prices around the world.   ""QE security blanket for markets has vanished,"" Hartnett wrote.   Wilson said that low unemployment — the jobless rate matched a half-century low in May — will force the Fed to keep raising rates, even if markets wobble.   ""It might take a larger financial accident to get the Fed to change direction or even pause than in the past,"" he said.   Investors are increasingly looking for safety in tech stocks. They poured about $2.3 billion into tech last week, the second most ever, according to Bank of America. The tech sector has enjoyed $140 billion of investment this year, on track for the biggest year on record, the firm said.   The thinking is that tech stocks, backed by strong results and bright outlooks, can grow in any environment. But Morgan Stanley's Wilson warned that growth stocks may not be safe once the next storm comes.   While it's ""impossible to predict when the moment of truth will come,"" Wilson said ""it could be at any moment, and without warning."" "
118,118,IHOP reveals the mystery of IHOb,http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/11/investing/ihob-ihop-burgers-name-change/index.html,"Jun 11, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   IHOP said on Monday that it's temporarily changing its branding because the B stands for burgers.   It's only a marketing campaign. IHOP isn't changing its name. But the chain of breakfast diners took social media by storm last week with the cryptic announcement that it was flipping the lowercase ""p"" in its logo and making it a ""b.""   IHOP, of course, stands for International House of Pancakes. But IHOP — sorry, IHOb — wants to be known as a place to get lunch and dinner, not just breakfast and brunch. It's adding several burgers to its menu, including a Big Brunch burger with bacon, a fried egg and browned potato on top.  Dear Internet, we abbreciate your batience. Now let's see who guessed right. B-hold!!!!! #IHOb pic.twitter.com/Fh3SkZ7s3Y    ""We are definitely going to be IHOP,"" Darren Rebelez, president of IHOP, told CNNMoney. ""But we want to convey that we are taking our burgers as seriously as our pancakes.""   An IHOP in Hollywood is getting new IHOb signs, and some others might get the treatment. The new IHOb Twitter account even retweeted photos and video of a construction crew putting up the new sign in LA.  They weren't playing. #ihop ➡️ #ihob pic.twitter.com/ZTySiRM7DH International House of Breakfast? #IHOb pic.twitter.com/q62B5150p5  But Rebelez said the vast majority of the nearly 1,800 other locations will still go by IHOP.   So, to use another B-word, will there be a backlash?   Some people correctly predicted it would stand for burgers, but many others on Twitter and Facebook thought the B would stand for breakfast or bacon.   Others had more fun, speculating that the B stood for bitcoin or break dancing.   Chiquita even got in on the act, saying that the B should stand for bananas.  🍌 pancakes, 🍌 syrup, 🍌 French toast, 🍌 crepes...We LOVE where you're going with this @IHOP 🎉😉 #InternationalHouseofBananas #IHOB pic.twitter.com/Pd8rLEXtuP  Others noted that the Ob in the IHOb logo looked extremely similar to the O.B. brand of tampons.  Well I don't know about you but nothing like the new logo that looks like a tampon brand to make me hungry for flapjacks! #IHOb Just sloppy management pic.twitter.com/eum338fj81    Rebelez isn't worried that people will be disappointed. He said some people were upset that IHOP would even consider tinkering with the name. But most fans figured out it was just a way to get people talking.   That clearly worked.   ""The vast majority of people were having fun with the name change and were trying to solve the riddle. They had fun for a week trying to figure it out,"" Rebelez said.   America loves burgers, and IHOP wants to be a bigger player at lunch and dinner.   When I asked Rebelez whether IHOP was considering food-fusion menu items — remember Burger King's Whopperito or Taco Bell's Nacho Fries? — he joked that diners could order a side of flapjacks and make their own pancake burger.   Still, it's worth wondering why IHOP is going through all this trouble. Why mess with a good thing?   IHOP owner Dine Brands (DIN) is also the parent company of Applebee's. Is Rebelez worried that he's competing more directly with his corporate sibling?   Not really. Rebelez said IHOP will remain family-focused, while Applebee's will still be a place to go with friends to get a beer and watch a game.   ""They have a bar,"" Rebelez said. ""If you want a burger and beer, you are not going to come to IHOP.""   In other words, the B in IHOb clearly doesn't stand for booze. "

Coinrail said it had temporarily suspended trading in digital currencies and was fully cooperating with investigators to try to track down the missing funds. The exchange did not disclose the value of tokens stolen. The theft was of less well-known cryptocurrencies rather than bitcoin itself.

120,120,"5 things for June 8: Trump summits, leak probe, migrants, suicides, Mars",http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/us/five-things-june-8-trnd/index.html,"Jun 8, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Congrats to the Washington Capitals! It took more than four decades, but they're finally Stanley Cup champs. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. World summits The G7 summit is supposed to be a meeting of friends, but it will be anything but friendly later today when President Trump meets up with his counterparts in Canada. US allies are furious with Trump over his trade policies, and the President just waged a Twitter war with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the subject.  Things look so frosty right now that Trump isn't even staying for the whole summit. He plans to leave Saturday morning, conveniently skipping sessions on climate change and the environment. He'll fly straight to Singapore for his much-anticipated meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be in China today for a state visit, his third trip to the country in about a year. 2. Leak investigation James Wolfe, a longtime US Senate staffer, was arrested on charges of lying to federal agents. It's all part of an investigation into leaks. Prosecutors accuse Wolfe of lying to FBI agents last year about his contacts with three reporters, including one he was in a personal relationship with. A trove of emails and phone records shows lots of contact between Wolfe and one reporter, including a text message in which Wolfe wrote, ""I always tried to give you as much information that I could,"" investigators said. The Trump administration wants to come down hard on leakers, and this is the first known instance of the Justice Department targeting a reporter's data under President Trump. 3. Migrant crisis The United Nations slapped sanctions on six men who allegedly made fortunes buying and selling vulnerable migrants. It's an unprecedented response to the international slave trade that was exposed by CNN. Two Eritreans and four Libyans -- including a commander with the Libyan Coast Guard -- are accused of running criminal networks that traffic migrants through Libya to Europe. The Libyan commander is accused of using guns to intentionally sink boats carrying migrants. Others in the group are accused of having ties to terror groups, selling migrants as sex slaves and being responsible for some of the worst migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean. The sanctions will freeze the men's financial assets and subject them to strict travel bans. 4. Suicides Suicide rates in the US increased more than 25% since 1999, a new CDC report finds. It was even worse in some parts of the country, with 25 states experiencing a rise in suicides of more than 30%. And more than half of those who died by suicide had not been diagnosed with a mental health condition. So, what's fueling the increase? ""Social and life and economic stressors are the ones that create the conditions for suicides to happen,"" one doctor said. Limited access to care, including behavioral and social services, also factored in. If you or someone you know might be at risk of suicide, there are ways to get help, including calling 1-800-273-8255 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 5. Mars Was there ever life on Mars? Scientists are still working on an answer to that, but they've gotten some tantalizing clues from NASA's Curiosity rover. It found organic matter in soil samples taken from a 3 billion-year-old mudstone. Curiosity also detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. So, what does that all mean? Searching for life beyond Earth means searching for organic compounds (like the organic matter in the mudstone) and molecules (methane is considered the simplest organic molecule). And Curiosity found evidence of both -- right there on the Red Planet.

IHOb? What could it b? #IHOb  Is this just a short-term marketing gimmick?   Spokespeople for IHOP and Dine Brands (DIN), the restaurant company that owns IHOP as well as Applebee's, were not immediately available for comment.   And it's not as if Dine Brands needs to reinvent the company. The stock is up nearly 25% this year because sales are growing at both IHOP and Applebee's.   Some people speculated on Twitter and Facebook that this could simply be a fun way to reintroduce pineapple upside down pancakes to the menu.   It's also hard to imagine why the company would want to mess with a name that's so well-known and beloved. It would also likely cost a big stack of pancakes (bancakes?) to change restaurant signs and menus at the nearly 1,800 IHOP restaurants.

""Consumers are still very fragile,"" Stifel Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza said on CNNMoney's ""Markets Now"" on Wednesday. ""Their economic footing hasn't really changed or improved.""   Piegza said that the new tax law has been a boon to companies, but that hasn't translated into more spending money for Americans.   The Trump administration promised that a lower corporate tax rate would allow companies to pump money back into the economy. But most businesses have instead used the extra cash to offer stock buybacks to investors.   Related: Tax cut fuels record $200 billion stock buyback bonanza   Piegza pointed out that consumers are still ""outspending' previous years -- but they're dipping into savings or relying on credit card debt. Plus, she added, lower gas prices meant consumers had more spending money. Recently, the price of oil has been volatile.   ""There is a disconnect between what we're seeing in the data and what Main Street America is feeling,"" Piegza said.     Piegza also warned that a recession could be near.   ""The risk of recession rapidly rises as we look out to the second half of 2019 and into 2020,"" she said, because wages aren't increasing by much and business investment is slowing down.

124,124,Russian farmers are ditching the ruble for a new cryptocurrency,http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/04/technology/russia-cryptocurrency-farmer-kolion/index.html,"Jun 4, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Farmers and small businesses around Kolionovo, 80 miles from the capital, are ditching the ruble and switching to a cryptocurrency -- the kolion -- to pay for local trade.   Banker turned farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov led the way. Diagnosed with cancer a decade ago, he moved out of the city with the aim of reviving a dying village.   Five years later, he needed funds to develop his plant nursery but ran into an obstacle many small Russian businesses face: banks wanted to charge 12% interest to lend him money.   ""I didn't want to suffocate and be a slave of the banks,"" Shlyapnikov says, putting a hand on his throat. ""So I had to invent my own money. And I did it. I'm my own bank, government, regulator.""   He started issuing paper kolions in 2014, but they were banned by a Russian court in 2015. So he started working on a cryptocurrency version, and in April 2017 raised $500,000 in an initial coin offering (ICO).   Unlike bitcoin, Shlyapnikov's cryptocurrency can't be mined using a computer. The digital tokens can be bought using a range of other cryptocurrencies, or earned through a process called ""plowing"" -- helping the residents of Kolionovo with farming and construction work.   It's changing the way people do business in the village.  This is a modal window.     Shlyapnikov, who calls himself an ""agro-anarchist"" and throws parties honoring Karl Marx, uses the currency to support what he calls the ""Kolionovo Ecosystem.""   He has persuaded about a hundred farmers and suppliers in the neighboring villages to use kolions for local trade, making paper money a rarity in the community.   Related: Why Nasdaq CEO is bullish on cryptocurrencies   ""We now have about $2 million in kolions because its value has jumped since the ICO,"" Shlyapnikov says, adding that the currency is backed by a reserve of 500 bitcoins (worth roughly $3.7 million at current prices.)   ""This way we can attract real money into the business,"" and connect the cryptocurrency with the real economy, he added.     Russia's economy has returned to growth after being hit by a one-two punch of Western sanctions and plummeting oil prices, shocks that saw the ruble lose half its value since 2014.   Now Shlyapnikov and other enthusiasts are touting cryptocurrency as a way to insulate themselves from Russia's financial system.   Cryptocurrencies have boomed in the country thanks to good scientific and technical education and some of the cheapest electricity in Europe to power the servers needed to mine them.   Last year alone, Russia had several blockchain projects attracting major funds, the largest ICO being the MobileGo games platform, which raised $53 million.   But it's still early days for cryptocurrencies in Russia, and the legal environment is shifting. Restaurants and shops were quick to spot the trend and allow customers to ""pay"" with bitcoin, although the owners must do mirror transactions in rubles to avoid falling foul of the law.   The emerging industry awaits regulations that President Vladimir Putin has ordered the Finance Ministry to introduce by July.   First drafts of the measures suggest that the ruble will remain the only legal form of payment but initial coin offerings and mining will be granted some legal protection.   Putin said earlier this year he wanted Russia to become more open to innovation, warning that ""those who ride the technological wave will advance, others will drown.""   Related: Russia eyes cruptocurrency dominance   The Russian president, however, has also voiced concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used by criminals, so questions remain how tolerant the Russian government will be of such experiments.   ""To move forward, we must expand the space for freedom, be a country open to the world, new ideas and initiatives ... to cut everything that prevents our people from opening their full potential,"" Putin said in March.   Shlyapnikov has more modest goals. He thinks cryptocurrencies could be a way for small and remote enterprises to survive independently from Moscow.   ""I don't want to expand because it will bring obligations I'm not ready for,"" the farmer says. ""I'm not ready to save the world or even Russia, I want to be comfortable and I want to share this comfort with the community."" "

The projection has made him confident that a short-term investment in US Treasury bonds is a good bet. Investors who focus on two-year treasury yields, he said, ""can sleep at night.""   ""For the first time in a while you're getting some real income from it.""   And US government bonds remain a good investment compared to other countries' debt.

126,126,Market uncertainty is back,http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/investing/rick-rieder-markets-now/index.html,"May 29, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," BlackRock (BLK) executive Rick Rieder will address a full agenda of topics on CNNMoney's ""Markets Now"" on Wednesday.   Rieder is a managing director and the global chief investment officer of fixed income for BlackRock. He joins CNNMoney anchor Maggie Lake during an interesting week.   It's been a volatile period for oil. Prices surged to their highest level in over three years last week. Now prices are slumping. US crude oil futures have dropped by nearly 10% to trade around $66.50 per barrel, down from about $73 last week.   Prices fell after Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said he was in intensive discussions with Russia and other OPEC nations to pump more oil to ease global supply concerns.   Rieder has argued that if the OPEC and Russia production cuts remain in place, and if other conditions are upheld, crude oil could remain in the $70-range — and that high price might not be so bad for consumers.   On Monday, Rieder had called OPEC's and Russian oil production as a ""pillar"" or support for energy prices. But he tweeted last week that the pillar ""appeared to show cracks.""   Related: Oil prices are falling fast. Here's why   On Tuesday, the White House said it plans to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China. The government added that it will place new limits on Chinese investments in US high-tech industries.   Some business leaders have warned that the tariffs could result in a trade war, which could raise prices on goods and end up hurting consumers.   Also on Tuesday, the market dropped around 400 points following a political crisis in Italy.   Despite all this uncertainty, Rieder still says there are opportunities in this market.   ""Considering a lack of discernible trading momentum, heightened volatility and a diminished ability to hedge, one might feel an overt pessimism toward today's market opportunity set,"" he wrote in a blog post last month.

Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation    Musk tweets:   • ""The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.""   Musk says the media is overstating Tesla's problems, failing to contextualize them against the rest of the auto industry and buying into an anti-Tesla narrative because, as he put it, ""fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world's biggest advertisers.""   Musk now he says he wants to create a site called Pravda ""where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication."" He registered Pravda Corp. as a foreign corporation last year.   Two things are true ...   1. The media is flawed:   • The media sometimes gets things wrong, it has a penchant for drama and controversy, and it is incentivized to establish narratives that don't always account for the complexities and nuance of business, politics or culture.   2. Musk is humiliating himself:   • He is using his vast power and influence to undermine journalists simply because he's miffed by negative coverage. The attacks have invited comparisons to Donald Trump.   • He is ignoring the fact that the media has lionized him for more than a decade, and given him a level of hero status not seen since Steve Jobs.   • He is overlooking the fact that years of showmanship and lofty promises about the future fueled the media's interest in him and his companies.   • He is sending a signal to Wall Street that he doesn't take Tesla's problems seriously, despite the fact that Tesla has very real problems.   • He is either woefully ill-informed about how media and advertising works, wrongly implying that journalists write to favor the companies who advertise on their site, or pretending to be.   • He is guilty of doing exactly what he faults the media for: Stirring up controversy, promoting an oversimplified narrative and getting things wrong.   The Big Picture: The media is far from perfect, but you don't get to be a modern-day P.T. Barnum and then cry and whine when the journalists who helped fuel your rise to stardom finally start peeking behind the curtain.   Bonus: Recode's Kara Swisher is trying to get Musk to next week's Code Conference in Palos Verdes ...

A new report from McKinsey Global Institute suggests that companies currently leading in AI may have ""an insurmountable advantage"" over competitors who have been slower to adopt those technologies:   • ""The pattern of significant growth and revenue gains going to firms at the forefront of adoption looks set to continue. Their ability to reinvest these gains and pull even further ahead of competitors may create an insurmountable advantage.""   • ""The most advanced adopters of AI and automation will also have an advantage when it comes to hiring, as they will tend to attract talent and can offer higher wages, if they successfully reap the productivity and performance gains from the technology adoption.""

The Big Picture: ""It has become a necessary public relations move for the company, which is still struggling to regain user trust. ...

Katlego Marite, 13, was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday.  Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to CNN that Marite had been found but declined to comment further on the circumstances. ""The combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation,"" Hlathi said.  The police spokesman also declined to comment on whether the bitcoin ransom demanded by the kidnappers was paid.  The men had demanded 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash.  In the ransom note, the kidnappers asked the boy's parents to pay ""One bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27."" The boy's family told police they didn't know what bitcoins were. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets. The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.

Police say Katlego Marite was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga.  Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told CNN the incident in the coal-mining city of Witbank was over in minutes and the abductors seemed to make a beeline for Marite.  ""It happened very fast and there was no struggle,"" Hlathi told CNN.  ""His friends reported that these were full grown men who just went for him and grabbed him into the car and dropped a ransom note. They demanded that his parents should pay a ransom in bitcoins.""  Hlathi said the sum demanded was 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash.  A copy of the ransom note was also posted on several social media accounts.  The kidnappers warn the parents not to involve the police, saying: ""We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met.""  The note asks the boy's family to pay 1 bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27. The family has yet to pay any of the ransom, Hlathi said. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets. The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.  Hlathi said the case was puzzling as Marite's parents are not wealthy and do not know what bitcoin currency is.  ""They are just in tatters right now,"" he said.   He added that he was not aware of any other ransom demands for bitcoins or any virtual currency in South Africa.  Although South Africa has a high crime rate, Hlathi said Witbank is a mining area where kidnapping is not frequent.  In December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in bitcoins for releasing their victim -- an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from Reuters news agency.

132,132,Can I start investing with $500?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/17/pf/how-to-start-investing/index.html,"May 17, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," You're in luck. There are plenty of places to start investing with as little as $500. Even far less.   Numerous investing apps and robo-advisors will put your money in the stock market starting with just $5. You even have enough money to open a brokerage account with some firms.   But with all these options, it's hard to know where to start.   First, make sure your finances are in good shape before taking on investment risk. Build an emergency fund and keep any money you might need within five years out of the market, said Rachel Rabinovich, a CFP at Society of Grownups.   But investing in stocks is a good way to grow your money for a longer-term goal because you'll have time to recover from dips in the market.   ""You need to be OK with losing the money you invest, at least in the short-term,"" Rabinovich said.   If you do feel comfortable putting a some money in the stock market, here's how to decide what investing platform is best for you.   Related: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?      With some robo-advisor platforms, you can invest a small amount of money in a portfolio that considers some of your preferences, like how much risk you're comfortable taking on. It's usually based on a questionnaire.   A portfolio will give you more diversification than investing in a single stock. Plus, it could include low-cost index funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that you might not have access to otherwise. Many require minimum initial investments when buying on your own.   ""It's nice to have something set up a portfolio for you. That's what we do as managers, so you're getting that service a little bit on the cheap with a robo-platform,"" said CFP Andrew McFadden, the founder of Panoramic Financial Advice.   Sometimes you're charged a fee based on the amount of money in your account. Betterment and Wealthfront, for example, both charge a 0.25% account fee. That amounts to $1.25 a year on $500.   Related: Are apps a good way to start investing?   Stash and Acorns charge a monthly fee of $1 a month, which can be a relatively high percentage for someone investing just $500.   These two apps offer something a little different. Stash allows you to choose a selection of stocks and ETFs that are focused on different themes, like technology or clean energy. Acorns connects to your credit card and rounds up your purchases to invest the spare change, as well as lets you set up bigger recurring or one-time investments.   Both Stash and Acorns require just $5 to start investing.        There are a handful of brokerage firms out there that allow you to open an account with $500 or less. They probably won't charge an account fee like a robo-advisor because you'll be picking your investments yourself, but there are usually commission fees ranging between $4 and $7 per trade.   But while you might be allowed to open an account with just $500, each fund has its own minimum and you might not have enough money to invest in what you want.   If you have more money to invest, you can get access to even lower-cost index funds and ETF options.      Investing in a few single stocks is more risky than investing in an index fund or ETF, which spread out the risk.   But it may not be such a bad idea if you're investing a small amount of money.

An app called Robinhood allows you to invest in single stocks without paying any trading fees. There is no account minimum, but you have to have enough money to buy a full share of individual stocks or ETFs. You cannot buy fractional shares.   The app also allows you to invest in stock options and cryptocurrencies, but Rabinovich doesn't recommend buying those more complicated investments as a beginner. "

The social network said it took down 21 million pieces of adult nudity in the first three months of the year, according to its first Community Standards Enforcement Report.   The report, released Tuesday, revealed how much content has been removed for violating standards. Its enforcement efforts between October 2017 and March 2018 include six categories: graphic violence; adult nudity and sexual activity; terrorist propaganda; hate speech; spam; and fake accounts.   The company estimated that for every 10,000 pieces of content seen on Facebook overall, between seven and nine of them violated its adult nudity and pornography standards.   Facebook's internal technology flagged adult nudity or sexual content about 96% of the time before it was reported by users, according to the report.   Related: Facebook suspends 200 apps over possible data misuse   But most of Facebook's removal efforts centered on spam and fake accounts promoting it. In the first quarter, Facebook disabled about 583 million fake accounts and removed 837 million pieces of spam, the report said.   Facebook acknowledged it has work to do when it comes to properly removing hate speech. It took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech during the period, only 38% of which was flagged by its algorithms.   ""For hate speech, our technology still doesn't work that well and so it needs to be checked by our review teams,"" Guy Rosen, Facebook's VP of product management, said in a blog post.   Meanwhile, Facebook removed or added warning labels to about 3.5 million pieces of graphic violence content. In this case, 86% was flagged by its technology.

134,134,Young people are drawn to cryptocurrency. But what about the risks?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/14/pf/crypto-kids/index.html,"May 14, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Investing in crypto sounded easier than how he was earning money — reselling high-end clothes on ebay. He started with a $6,000 investment to buy part of a bitcoin last December when it was priced around $15,000. Five months, and some additional investments later, he now owns eight bitcoins, worth about $70,000.   The thing that sets him apart as an investor? Ray Russell is a 17-year-old high-school junior from Maryland.   There's still a huge debate over whether crypto is the way of the future, or a passing fad. Even as some legendary investors are calling out crypto as ""rat poison"" and ""trading turds,"" other mainstream investors are expanding and doubling down on the asset.   Young people are increasingly drawn to cryptocurrencies as a way to make easy money. But their inexperience with investing makes them even more vulnerable to an already high-risk investment.   Consequently, regulators, financial educators and parents are struggling to keep up with a dynamic and evolving investment that they may fear more than they understand.      When Ray first asked his mother, Mia Russell, what she knew about bitcoin, she told him diplomatically: it's an intangible asset, but there's a lot of risk and we don't know how it's going to work.   ""I wanted to say, 'What in the world?! This is crazy!' "" said Russell, a finance professional. ""But I know that won't be productive.""   Still, she's concerned. The elder Russell noticed by looking over her son's accounts (to which she has access) that money was going out to CoinBase, a cryptocurrency exchange. And money was coming in.   ""I would say, 'How does he have more money in his checking account than I do?'"" she said.   And Mia Russell is no rube: she's worked in finance for more than 20 years. She's taught university level courses on personal finance and now works with a national financial institution creating money management programs.   But ask her about distributed ledger technology, and she's a little out of her depth. When Ray talks about bitcoin, she says she feels like all her real world experience and academic training can't provide him the answers he needs.   ""I chuckle because I am relatively knowledgeable in this space and I'm challenged,"" she says. ""My son will joke. 'You don't even know about this and you have a PhD!'""   Ray says most of his knowledge has come not from adults, but from friends, websites, YouTube videos and a massive online open course on crypto.   ""A lot of adults feel like bitcoin is a fraud,"" he says. ""And people keep telling me to sell before I lose all my money. But once you make that much money and people are telling you it's a scam, it's like: 'How? I already made so much.'""        Young people, as digital natives, have inherent advantages when it comes to understanding cryptocurrency. But do they understand the very grown-up underlying risk?   ""When you talk to investors who have been in the market a long time, they understand that along with the potential for high reward almost always comes the possibility of high risk,"" said Owen Donley III, chief counsel, office of investor education and advocacy at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""My concern is that young people may not have gotten that message. They certainly haven't lived that message. And it is hard especially when it is competing against a loud get-rich-quick media environment.""   Donley said that cryptocurrency concerns are one of the leading areas of questions and complaints at his agency's consumer-facing site, Investor.gov. His office is actively looking at ways to meet investors where they are with reliable information.   Financial educators, like Ray's mom, are also working to keep up with crypto and have concerns about its appeal among young people.   ""The money is his. It's not like that money is tied up with anything important like college savings or retirement,"" said Mia Russell (who required him to put $2,500 in a Roth IRA first). ""But when money so easily comes into his hands, what's the consequence of that later on? I want him to value earning it and saving in some way.""   She says some of the young people she's taught view investing as a way to pay off their debt, and she sees them being pulled to crypto as a quick payday, one that could go really badly and cost a lot in taxes.   ""They are already delaying purchasing a home, marriage and other life milestones,"" she says. ""What if you are investing in something so speculative? How do you build on that?""   For his part, Ray has learned some lessons by losing money in investments. But overall, he's not too concerned about the risks. 17-year-old Ray Russell has made thousands trading Cryptocurrency. But his mom, Mia Russell, has concerns about the risks.   ""Honestly the only concern is that I'm actually wrong and bitcoin does go down and I lose money,"" he says. ""If that happens, I just have to figure out when's a good time to get out."" "

Facebook told CNNMoney the developers behind the 200 apps have been notified. The company said it will not publicly disclose which apps are involved unless it can confirm misuse.   Cambridge Analytica, which worked on President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, used data collected via an app developed by University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan.    The app offered a personality test, but Facebook users who downloaded it also gave the professor permission to collect data on their location, their friends and content they had ""liked.""   Kogan provided that data to Cambridge Analytica, in a breach of Facebook's rules. Facebook said it asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data in 2015, but learned in March that this had not happened.   Kogan has said he suspects thousands of other developers and data scientists used similar methods to gather information on Facebook users.   In response to a backlash that cost the company billions in lost market value, Facebook said it would investigate every app that had access to large amounts of data prior to 2014, when it tightened its controls.

CEO Adena Friedman is optimistic that blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, will play a key role in the economy.   ""We see technology as a relentless change agent and our job is to embrace that change, to bring it to the industry, and make it so that our industry continues to be a very successful industry in the next decade or even beyond that,"" Friedman tells CNN's Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files.   She is helping Nasdaq expand its offerings beyond the traditional stock exchange to an emerging platform that provides the infrastructure for other exchanges to participate in and monitor trading activity in the cryptocurrency market.   In April, Nasdaq inked a deal with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini Trust. Founded by early bitcoin investors, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini will use Nasdaq's technology to ensure trading activity is in compliance.   ""There are a lot of exciting things in the machine intelligence space. There are a lot of exciting things in the trading space,"" says Friedman.

One potential roadblock: government regulation.     ""Are the governments going to start to embrace it? Or are they still going to have it sit outside the realm of their oversight? That's the real question that's yet to be answered,"" Friedman tells Harlow. ""I think the technology is fascinating and it's a very sound technology. It's just a matter of making sure that the community is all embracing it together.""   As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, Nasdaq remains at the brink of it all.   ""The first uses of the blockchain will be in the less regulated markets, less efficient markets, more bespoke markets.

139,139,Can this technology modernize how we vote?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/08/technology/blockchain-voting-elections-votem/index.html,"May 8, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   But here's one thing you can't do: vote for elected officials.   Some advocates see the potential of a more modernized system amid concerns about US election security and aging voting machines.   A major reason people don't vote is because they can't get to the polls, according to John Patrick, author of ""Election Attitude: How Internet Voting Leads to a Stronger Democracy.""   ""This old system does not accommodate the busy people we are today and the people who are sick, in nursing homes, [or] in the military,"" he said. ""There are a hundred reasons why people can't vote.""   But to keep smartphone voting safe, experts are looking toward blockchain technology, a super secure and transparent public ledger with the history of transaction data from anyone who uses a certain service. Although blockchain is most associated with powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, it can be applied to other areas, such as health care or voting.   Related: Hackers will work with government, academia to make future elections secure   Blockchain uses a decentralized network of computers that all work on the same task -- and no one entity owns the system.   This means when a transaction is initiated between two computers, such as casting a vote, it has to be certified by another. That makes it difficult to manipulate or change the data. For the transaction to go through, a bunch of computers have to solve a complicated math problem.   But that doesn't mean Americans will be tapping smartphones to elect officials anytime soon. Some voting security experts are wary of applying the technology to major elections.   Voters could fall prey to phishing scams, viruses and malware on their smartphones or laptops, even if a blockchain-based voting system is secure, according to David Dill, a professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford University who studies electronic voting.   ""Smartphones and laptops aren't secure, and at this point, they can't be made secure,"" he said. ""People could be tricked into something that's malicious.""   Related: Forget bitcoin. Here come the blockchain ETFs.   However, a startup called Votem argues mobile voting has the potential to boost voter turnout, increase accuracy and reignite trust in election results. The company says it can verify and count votes in real time on its blockchain-based voting platform.   The company, which began operating in early 2016, has tested its system with several private elections, including for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Ohio State Bar Association. Meanwhile, Votem tested a non-blockchain version of its platform during the 2016 general election, such as running online voting and registration for people serving in the military and US citizens living overseas for Washington, DC.   Votem allows users to register and vote via its mobile app or a desktop computer, and then serves up a ballot. The system creates ""nodes"" from mathematical algorithms to determine the ballot's legitimacy. For example, the nodes examined if the vote came from a bad IP address or if it's a real voter.   To date, more than 8 million votes have been cast using Votem across private elections. The company hopes to offer this method to several jurisdictions for the 2018 midterm elections.   US elections still largely rely on paper ballots. Most voting machines used to cast and count votes were bought between 2002 and 2008, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan and non-governmental organization. Some small municipalities in states such as New Hampshire even count votes by hand.   ""[As of today], you still have to physically go to the polling place and fill out a paper ballot"" Pete Martin, Votem's CEO and founder, told CNN.   He said replacing the current process with newer technology will only make a ""bad process faster.""     Related: We watched hackers break into voting machines   Other startups, such as Voatz in Boston and Smartmatic in London, are also testing blockchain-based voting systems. But these companies face many challenges.   ""This industry is very resistant to change,"" Votem's Martin said. ""The risks are incredibly high for getting this right. There is nothing more fundamental than a fair voting system.""   In addition, certifying new voting systems in the US is a complicated process, and the requirements vary by state.   For now, security experts remain skeptical.   ""Online voting for government elections is a horrifically bad idea,"" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that promotes an open and free internet. ""The internet, and more importantly the devices we use, are completely insecure.""   Although Joe Kiniry -- CEO and chief scientist of Free & Fair, a company focused on election technologies and services -- says blockchain voting could potentially be a useful solution for private elections, it's a risky method for government elections with a lot at stake.   ""Internet voting and blockchain are all about putting voters and computers directly on the internet to run an election. It's putting the tastiest target in the world politically directly on the threat vector [of] all these bad actors out there,"" Kiniry said. ""We have to assume they will use their most advanced technology and capabilities to threaten that election.""   Some experts like Stanford's Dill believe paper ballots are the best voting method for now. He also advocates for auditing the results by taking a random sample and counting those votes by hand to double check the results.   ""Maybe internet or blockchain voting could be the thing at some future point, but it's not ready for prime time yet,"" Dill said. "

141,141,Warren Buffett says bitcoin is 'rat poison',http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/07/investing/warren-buffett-bitcoin/index.html,"May 7, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The price of bitcoin took a dive after Warren Buffett renewed his criticism of the cryptocurrency — even comparing it to rat poison.   Bitcoin had been closing in on $10,000, but it fell nearly 6% Sunday and was down another 2% Monday to just over $9,300.   Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), has been a bitcoin bear for years. He has often compared the cryptocurrency to gold, saying that both assets are strictly speculative and don't produce earnings and dividends like stocks do.   Related: Warren Buffett is not too worried about a trade war   Before the Berkshire annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett told CNBC that bitcoin was ""probably rat poison squared.""   During the meeting itself, Buffett joked that ""if you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it's a couple tenths of a percent."" What Buffett was saying about bitcoin was that you can buy it, but it will never produce anything of value.   He also responded to a question from the audience about bitcoin by saying that it and other crytpocurrencies ""will come to bad endings.""   Berkshire vice chairman and longtime Buffett confidant Charlie Munger was even more blunt.   Related: Here is what happened at this year's Woodstock of capitalism   ""I like cryptocurrencies a lot less than you do,"" Munger said to Buffett. ""To me, it's just dementia. It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can't be left out.""   Munger has also referred to bitcoin as poison. At the shareholder meeting of The Daily Journal (DJCO), a newspaper publisher in Los Angeles where Munger serves as chairman, he called it ""noxious.""   Strong words. But to be fair to bitcoin bulls, both Buffett and Munger have been wrong about the cryptocurrency. Buffett in particular.   He first called bitcoin a ""mirage"" in 2014 — back when it was trading for about $600. So even with the recent pullback, bitcoin has drastically outperformed the broader market, not to mention Berkshire stock and top Berkshire holdings like Apple (AAPL).   That's why some cryptocurrency experts think that investors should ignore Buffett's and Munger's repeated bitcoin bashing.   ""What I do find monumentally baffling is that two of the world's most successful investors cannot see the intrinsic value of some form of cryptocurrency,"" Nigel Green, CEO of financial consulting firm deVere Group, wrote in a report early Monday.   ""Do they honestly believe that there is no place for, and no value of, digital, global currencies in an increasingly digitalized and globalized world?"" Green added. "

Others go glamping. But the truly hip enjoy the great outdoors in a big ol' bubble. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Eric Schneiderman New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman -- a vocal proponent of the #MeToo movement and a rising star in the Democratic party -- has resigned. He stepped down after a bombshell report in The New Yorker detailed assault allegations made against him by four women. The women, two who spoke on the record, said Schneiderman hit and choked them. He denied the allegations but said he was stepping down because ""they will effectively prevent me from leading the office's work at this critical time."" Schneiderman brought legal action against Harvey Weinstein and was a fierce critic of President Trump. 2. Iran nuclear deal Will he or won't he? We won't know until this afternoon, but all indications are that President Trump will indeed pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama-era pact that Trump and Republicans despise. Most observers predict Trump will decide against extending the sanctions waivers on Iran's energy and banking sector, effectively leaving the deal. What would the consequences be? Some warn it could start a Mideast arms race if Iran also leaves the deal and restarts its nuclear program. Others say it could send a message to North Korea about the reliability of the US as a negotiating partner. 3. Primaries It's primary day in Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia, four states that went for Donald Trump in 2016. The outcomes in these races will begin to provide answers to some key questions about how November's midterms are shaping up for both parties.  The headliner today is the West Virginia GOP Senate primary. Republicans fear a win by former coal baron Don Blankenship could spell disaster in a general election match-up against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Blankenship spent a year in prison in connection with a 2010 mine explosion that killed 29 workers, and he's hit Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, with some racially charged attacks. Blankenship considers himself ""Trumpier than Trump,"" but the President wants nothing to do with him and urged West Virginians to vote against him. 4. Hawaii volcanic eruptions Volcanic activity has subsided at all 12 fissures on the Big Island, but a geologist warns this is most likely just a pause and this slow-moving natural disaster is far from over. So far, 35 structures have been destroyed, including at least 26 homes. Some of the 1,700 residents who had to flee their homes on the eastern end of the island were briefly allowed to retrieve needed items.  And despite a break in the action, danger still exists in the area, in the form of earthquakes and newly formed cracks. Since Friday's big 6.9-magnitude quake, the Big Island's endured about one earthquake per hour. 5. Nigeria Some good news out of Nigeria. The army there says it has rescued more than 1,000 captives of Boko Haram. Most of the captives were woman and children, as well as young men who had been forced to become fighters for the terrorist group. A report last month said Boko Haram has kidnapped more than 1,000 children in Nigeria since 2013, and the group sparked global outrage after its militants seized 276 girls from a boarding school in 2014. Some of those girls were freed last year. CNN could not confirm if the remaining Chibok girls were among those freed in this latest operation.

143,143,Apple inches closer to $1 trillion market value,http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/07/investing/apple-trillion-dollar-market-value/index.html,"May 7, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The stock hit an all-time high Monday, and the company moved closer to a milestone — the first $1 trillion market value.   Apple stock surged on Friday, when Buffett revealed on the eve of the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting that Berkshire had acquired 75 million more shares.   The Oracle of Omaha's company owns more than 240 million shares of Apple, about a 5% stake. Shares of Apple (AAPL) rose nearly 2% more on Monday. The company is now worth more than $940 billion.   It's been a great month for Apple.   The company wowed Wall Street with better than expected profits on May 1, even as it reported that iPhone sales have slowed in the United States. Sales in China and Japan grew dramatically.   Apple also showered investors with plans for a huge stock buyback program, which should boost earnings per share, and a dividend increase. Apple's stock is up 13% in May.   Buffett gushed about the buybacks at the Berkshire meeting, telling investors that share repurchases were a sensible use of Apple's ginormous pile of cash.   Investors had feared that Apple's best days were past. All of a sudden, they were thinking it could be the best of two worlds — a value stock and a growth stock — thanks largely to Buffett's endorsement.   The Apple rally has been good for the rest of tech as well. Apple may be the first US company to reach a vaunted $1 trillion market cap. But three others may not be far behind.   Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the owner of Google, are each worth about $750 billion. And Amazon (AMZN) is now valued at more than three quarters of a trillion dollars.   Related: Buffett loves Apple but he just called bitcoin 'rat poison'   Even Facebook (FB), which took a hit from the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, is worth $515 billion — less than 10% below its all-time high from earlier of this year.   The broad rally in tech is more stunning when you consider that Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and Gmail, has been plagued by similar concerns about Russia-bought ads on its platforms.   And Amazon has been a target of ire and derision from President Trump.   But the five largest tech stocks are now valued at more than $3.7 trillion collectively. To put that into context, they were worth a little less than $3.3 trillion at the end of October.   So much for bad press hurting the sector. It looks like investors' love affair with Apple and the rest of Big Tech is still going strong. "

The Big Picture: ""To the extent that China's standards supplant Western ones, it will represent a direct threat to the profitability of non-Chinese companies. ... [and] it will undoubtedly challenge their ability to commercialize technology in other markets.""   Meanwhile ...

The boost comes after Warren Buffett said over the weekend that Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares, an investment of more than $11 billion in the company. Berkshire is now Apple's third largest holder, behind Vanguard and BlackRock.   Buffett and Bill Gates also praised Apple this morning on CNBC:   • Buffett: ""We bought about 5 percent of the company. I'd love to own 100 percent of it. ... We like very much the economics of their activities. We like very much the management and the way they think.""   • Gates: ""Apple's an amazing company, and the multiple's not gigantic. ...

Tim Cook is ""thrilled"": ""On a personal level, I've always greatly admired Warren and have always been grateful for his insight and advice,"" the Apple CEO said in a statement.   The Big Picture: The votes of confidence from Buffett and Gates are an immense boon to Apple, which has endured weeks of scrutiny over a slowdown in iPhone sales. The statements will boost long-term confidence in the world's largest market cap company.   What else Buffett said:   • Apple's iPhone is one of several products protected by a competitive ""moat.""

145,145,The quest to build a million Obamas,http://www.cnn.com/2018/05/06/politics/a-million-obamas/index.html,"May 6, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)Barack Obama is done being on ballots, but there will be ample opportunities to support him in 2018. A club of young politicians is trading on his popularity and mission to kick-start their own careers. And its all part of the master plan the former President has laid out. At 56, Obama is more popular than he's been in nearly a decade, and as an ex-president, his favorable ratings are expected to keep rising. At a time when our politics has become increasingly ugly, divisive, and crude, a political figure like Obama is rare. In his retirement, Obama is redefining the post-presidency. Although he's generally following the career path set by his predecessors -- there's a foundation, and the library and memoir are on their way -- he's doing it bigger. The publisher of his and Michelle's forthcoming books promised ""global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance,"" his presidential library is actually going to have a public library in it, and he's in talks with Netflix to produce shows. But those aren't even the biggest projects on his to-do list. ""After I left office, what I realized is the Obama Foundation could eventually create a platform for young up-and-coming leaders, both in the United States and around the world,"" Obama said at a conference in Tokyo in March. ""If I could do that effectively, then, you know, I would create a hundred or a thousand or a million young Barack Obamas or Michelle Obamas, or, you know, the next group of people who could take that baton in that relay race that is human progress and continue to build on the work that we have done. So that's really going to be my focus."" A million Obamas. It's one of the most ambitious goals ever for a former American president. Obama alumni running for office ""People miss President Obama,"" said Brian Forde, a former senior advisor in the Obama administration's Office of Science and Technology. ""It's not just Democrats."" Two out of three Americans like Obama, according to a January CNN poll. That includes 94% of liberals, 74% of moderates, and 37% of conservatives. He's a far more popular former president than his predecessors were in Gallup polls taken the year after they left office. Bill Clinton was at 47% in 2002. George W. Bush was at 45% in 2010. Forde is now running for Congress in California's 45th district, in Orange County. The founder of a phone company in Nicaragua before he got into government, he's positioned himself as a tech-literate, Bitcoin-friendly candidate. And he's not the only Obama alum running. This year, more than 60 former members of the administration are running for elected office, according to the Obama Alumni Association. There are former interns and campaign staffers, an ex-ambassador to Denmark, and the former director for Iraq in Obama's National Security Council. More than two dozen alumni are running for Congress, and others are running for state offices in 13 states. ""We learned a lot working for him,"" Forde said. ""And the most good we can do is go back home, taking what you learned, and applying it to help people locally."" Forde and the other alumni candidates are the first wave of neo-Obamas. They're doing what their old boss asked them to. Action is a hallmark of Obamaism, true to its community-organizing roots. Don't boo, vote, he'd say campaigning. Today, the message is don't resist, run. ""If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself,"" he said in his farewell address in Chicago in January 2017. New Obama Cool The original Obama brand, of the 2008 campaign, was a pop cultural phenomenon. It inspired street art by Shepard Fairey, a pop song by will.i.am., and a new generation of voters. But after a decade of politics, it's time for a refresh. Kehinde Wiley's floral portrait of Obama unveiled in February is a pop sequel to Fairey's ""Hope."" Michelle's portrait, by Amy Sherald, was so popular the Smithsonian had to move it to accommodate visitors. The couple's memoirs will be bestsellers, whatever they do on Netflix will generate international interest, and support for Obamacare reached an all-time high last year. And of course, there was the time the former FLOTUS literally dressed as a pop star, celebrating Beyoncé's birthday with a ""Formation""-themed photo. Welcome to New Obama Cool. The Obama campaign's logo, color scheme, and sans-serif font have inspired political design ever since. The ""O"" logo has been featured on a shoe by Steph Curry, and it's shown up in the congressional campaign logos of Brent Welder, a former field and get-out-the-vote director for the Obama campaign running in Kansas, and Levi Tillemann, a former Department of Energy adviser running in Colorado. Tillemann said his logo, which doubles the red and whites stripes of the Obama ""O"" with a Colorado ""C"" rising above, is meant to evoke a number of things, including the Colorado mountains and ""the hope that Obama instilled in all of us, and the fact that that hope isn't gone, we just need to rekindle it."" For older millennials, who are now in their 30s, ""Obama ""was a watershed. He was a flash of lightning. He really was a political revolution,"" Tillemann said. Obama's call to run for office ""resonated powerfully"" with him and ""it was one of a number of factors that made me decide to run,"" he said. Running for office after working in the White House isn't unique to Obama alumni. Before he was a senator from Texas, Ted Cruz worked on George W. Bush's 2000 campaign and in his Federal Trade Commission. And New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik worked in Bush's Domestic Policy Council and chief of staff's office. But having Obama on your resume is especially powerful in 2018, Tillemann said. ""Most presidents gain some benefit of the doubt with the passage of time,"" he said. ""As we have receded farther and farther away from his presidency, and Washington has slouched further and further into the swamp, the decency and altruism of Obama shines through ever more brightly."" Keeping the spirit of Obama alive The new generation of leaders Obama hopes to inspire aren't just heading to Washington. The Obama Foundation recently announced the Community Leadership Corps program for 18- to 25-year-olds in Chicago, Phoenix, and Columbia, South Carolina. And in July, he's launching Obama Foundation Leaders: Africa for 200 young people there. It's at once a community and a global project. Growing up, Ammar Campa-Najjar was inspired by Obama's story. ""His journey that I read about in 'Dream From my Father' really resonated with me, because I went through a similar path of self-discovery. Not being Latino enough to the Latinos, or being Arab enough or American enough."" He went to work for Obama, in his White House selecting the 10 letters he would ready daily from Americans, and in the Department of Labor. Today, Campa-Najjar is running for Congress in California's 50th District, in an ""Obama way."" That means a ""compelling grassroots message"" and a ""strong digital presence,"" he said. ""Mobilizing, organizing a real people power movement. Grassroots. Not fueled by hate but by hope."" It's a template that can be used in California or Chicago, and in Iowa or Africa. Minting a million new Obamas is ambitious, and if the former president is successful inspiring a next generation of progressive leaders, he could leave a political legacy that lasts far longer than his eight years in office and is independent of his time as president. ""His call to action was not to defend his legacy, his call to action is to build on it. And even if we have to undo some of it to go forward, he would be the first one to say go for it,"" Campa-Najjar said. ""The way forward is keep the spirit of Obama alive, even if his policies and accomplishments are superseded by our own in the future."" "

Next?""   • Musk to the next analyst, who asked about Model 3 reservations: ""These questions are so dry.

The gist of what Zimmer is saying is right, even if the timeline may be overly ambitious: Cars are an economic burden and innovations in autonomous transportation should, at some future date, rule out the need for humans to drive themselves around a city.   Who owns that future?   • Zimmer on Lyft vs. Uber: ""We believe we're about 35% market share in the United States. That's up from about probably 12% a couple years ago. ... We're growing significantly faster than Uber.""   • The Information's Amir Efrati says Lyft had a chance to catch up with Uber last year, but moved too slowly ""in developing features for riders and making decisions about new markets.""   What's Next:   • The Lyft Long Game: Continue to improve the product while differentiating from Uber by telegraphing a values-based business model.   • The Uber Long Game: Improve the company's reputation before taking it public by highlighting attempts to diversity the workforce.   • James Bailey, a Professor of Leadership Development at George Washington's School of Business, tells me Uber's job ""is easier than it looks. ...

Richard Blumenthal ""is calling on Uber to make it easier for women who've been sexually assaulted by drivers to have their day in court,"" my colleague Sara Ashley O'Brien reports:   • Sen. Blumenthal sent a letter to the Uber CEO asking him to ""immediately stop using forced arbitration agreements against victims of sexual harassment or assault.""   • ""The move comes in response to an exclusive CNN investigation ... that found at least 103 Uber drivers in the United States who have been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the past four years.""   • The CNN investigation also found that 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault over the same four-year period.   What Zimmer told me:   • ""This is an issue that is a problem for society ... One incident is too many in society and one incident is too many on our platform.""   • ""We were the first to put criminal background checks in place for the industry; [we have] driving record checks that were more strict than what taxis and limos had done previously; and a million-dollar insurance liability policy.""   • ""But we should all be doing more, and when there are opportunities to do more we should continue to do that.""

What You Need to Know, via CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi:   • ""The Seattle City Council wants to impose a 'head tax' on businesses to fund programs to address homelessness and affordable housing. Companies would pay ... roughly $540 a year for every full-time employee.""   • ""Amazon is ... in the bull's eye of the proposed tax: With more than 45,000 employees, Amazon could pay more than $20 million a year.""   • In response, Amazon says it ""is temporarily halting construction of a new 17-floor tower ... and may sublease its space in a major downtown development. The two projects [were] expected to create 7,000 Amazon jobs plus more in construction and other industries.""   What's Next: The City Council plans to vote on the tax proposal on May 14. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan says she is ""concerned about the impact [Amazon's] decision will have on a large range of jobs"" and will work with both sides to find common ground.   Amazon's Leverage:   • The third biggest market cap company in the world can go almost anywhere it wants. It is currently considering 20 finalists for its second headquarters and this week announced staff expansions in both Boston and Vancouver.

147,147,Crypto company's stock plunges on SEC probe,http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/investing/riot-blockchain-sec-subpoena-crytptocurrency-bitcoin/index.html,"Apr 19, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Riot Blockchain's stock has plummeted 77% in 2018. (Bitcoin prices have plunged 40% in 2018.)   The bursting of the bitcoin bubble clearly is hurting Riot Blockchain (RIOT). But news worsened when the company disclosed to investors Wednesday that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The stock has fallen more than 10% in just the past two days ... and the worst may not be over.   Riot Blockchain used to be called Bioptix. It made fertility hormones for cows, horses and pigs. And it still does.   But Bioptix changed its name to Riot Blockchain last October and said its new focus ""will be as a strategic investor and operator in the blockchain ecosystem with a particular focus on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.""   The stock surged from about $5 a share to a high of $46.20 by December. Then cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and litecoin, started sinking. It's been all downhill for Riot Blockchain ever since.   Related: SEC suspends trading of once red-hot bitcoin stock   The company said in an SEC filing it ""believes that many companies engaged in blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses have received subpoenas from the SEC which presents an additional industry risk.""   Riot Blockchain added ""the existence of an investigation ... could have a materially adverse effect on the company, its business or operations, and the industry as a whole.""   Making matters worse, Riot Blockchain disclosed that the Nasdaq has warned it will delist the company's stock if it fails to hold an annual shareholder meeting soon.   The company said it did not have a quorum of shareholders but hoped to be able do so at a reconvened meeting it plans to hold no later than the middle of next month. But Riot Blockchain said there were no assurances it could get a quorum this time either.   Riot Blockchain is hardly the only company guilty of trying to cash in on the crypto craze.   Eastman Kodak  (KODK)-- yes, the camera and film company -- launched its own KodakCoin.   LongFin (LFIN), a financial tech firm that recently went public, and initially skyrocketed after announcing that it bought a blockchain microlender, has lost nearly half of its value this year.   A company called Long Blockchain, (LBCC) which used to be known as Long Island Iced Tea, has plunged nearly 90%.   And shares of a small company called Nodechain (NODC) have dropped by more than 90% this year too. Nodechain got into the cryptocurrency mining business last December. Before that, it was a maker of electronic cigarettes called Vapetek.   That's one reason why the SEC and other regulators around the world are taking steps to crack down on fraud by companies seeking to take advantage of bitcoin mania, particularly those that are trying to raise money through initial coin offerings, or ICOs.   Related: Bitcoin plunges as social media cracks down on ICO ads   In an ICO, a company is selling digital currencies, as opposed to stock, to investors. But these sales are not regulated by the SEC as share offerings are in an initial public offering or IPO.   Regulators aren't the only ones growing more leery of cryptos though. Last month, Twitter (TWTR) banned ads for ICOs and token sales. Google (GOOGL) also said last month that it will begin restricting some crypto ads in June.   And Facebook (FB) announced in January it was prohibiting the sale of ads that ""promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices"" -- which included ICOs and bitcoin.   So if the bitcoin bust continues, Riot Blockchain may find the business of helping get farm animals pregnant isn't so bad after all. "

On Tuesday, Microsoft, Facebook and 32 other companies signed on to the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a pact to work together on cybersecurity issues. In addition to stymieing governmental cyberattacks, the companies also agreed to collaborate on stronger defense systems and protect against tampering of their products.   ""We called on the world to borrow a page from history in the form of a Digital Geneva Convention, a long-term goal of updating international law to protect people in times of peace from malicious cyberattacks,"" Microsoft president Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Tuesday.   The financial impact of cybersecurity attacks on businesses and organizations is expected to reach $8 trillion by 2022.   Firms such as Cisco, HP, Nokia, Oracle also joined the accord. Notably, absent from the signers were Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.   Microsoft called for a more uniform approach to protecting users in 2017. The warning came several months before two major ransomware cybersecurity attacks crippled businesses around the world.   Related: Former Google CEO says everyone forgot about criminals when building the internet   In May, WannaCry ransomware targeted more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries, including 48 UK medical facilities. In a bid to help, Microsoft issued patches for old Windows systems, even though it no longer supports them, because so many firms run old software that was vulnerable to the attack. The White House attributed the attack to North Korea.   In June, NotPetya ransomware, which initially targeted computers in Ukraine before spreading, infected computers, locked down their hard drives, and demanded a $300 ransom to be paid in bitcoin. Victims that paid weren't able to recover their files. The British government said Russia was behind the global cyberattack.   ""We called on the world to borrow a page from history in the form of a Digital Geneva Convention, a long-term goal of updating international law to protect people in times of peace from malicious cyberattacks,"" wrote Microsoft president Brad Smith in a blog post on Tuesday.   Github's chief strategy officer Julio Avalos wrote in a separate blog post that ""protecting the internet is becoming more urgent every day as more fundamental vulnerabilities in infrastructure are discovered—and in some cases used by government organizations for cyberattacks that threaten to make the internet a theater of war.""   ""Reaching industry-wide agreement on security principles and collaborating with global technology companies is a crucial step toward securing our future,"" Avalos added. "

Schneiderman said on Tuesday that his office reached out to 13 trading platforms, including the popular Coinbase, seeking information on their operations, internal controls, and safeguards for investors.   ""With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money. Yet too often, consumers don't have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms,"" said Schneiderman in a statement.   The attorney general's office mentioned past problems with exchanges that trade digital currency, including ""reports of the theft of vast sums of virtual currency from customer accounts,"" as well as outages, ""possible market manipulation,"" and difficulty withdrawing funds.   Schneiderman's office sent them questionnaires asking where their customers are based, which banks hold their customers' funds and how much they charge for fees.   Coinbase did not immediately respond to an email from CNNMoney.   Digital currencies are not backed by any government, allowing the exchanges that trade them to avoid federal scrutiny, though that is changing.   Related: SEC warns investors to look out for ICO fraud   Questions about trading platforms for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and dash have increased since late last year, as the digital currencies soared to meteoric heights. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors to be on the lookout for fraud involving Initial Coin Offerings, a form of fundraising in the crypto community that resembles Initial Public Offerings, but without the regulatory controls.   The SEC's newly created Cyber Unit also started going after ""pump and dump"" schemes where fraudsters lure investors, take their money, and run.   Related: SEC wants to rein in bitcoin exchanges   In Asia, the epicenter of cryptocurrency trading, China and South Korea have both cracked down on digital currency trading.   The scrutiny has taken a toll on cryptocurrencies, which took a dive last month after the SEC warned of ""potentially unlawful trading platforms for trading digital assets."" The SEC said investors should buy and sell cryptocurrency through platforms registered with the commission.    Cryptos have recovered somewhat, with experts saying investors used their tax returns to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.   Coinbase suspended its own trading of bitcoin cash, an alternative version of bitcoin, in December 2017 after seeing a wild price increase on other exchanges before its launch on Coinbase. "
150,150,Bitcoin surges 10% in an hour ahead of tax day,http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/12/technology/bitcoin-rally-tax-day/index.html,"Apr 12, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Bitcoin jumped 10% in just one hour, adding nearly $1,000 and surging above $7,000 for the first time since Sunday.   Other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash, made double-digit gains as well, ending a month-long sell-off.   Cryptocurrency experts say there are several factors driving the rally, but the most significant is April 17, the deadline to file taxes in the United States.   Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, which provides software used by Dash traders, said that investors are jumping back into the cryptocurrency market at the end of a tax-related sell-off. He said they've been unloading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks to pay their looming tax bills. But with tax day, April 17, rapidly approaching, most of these investors have paid their tax bills, he said, and some investors have received tax returns that they're spending on cryptocurrencies.   ""The selling pressure associated with tax day has subsided right now,"" said Taylor. ""As people get their tax returns, there may be new money entering the market.""   Related: What is bitcoin?   It appears that investors are warming back up to bitcoin after a dramatic slump that's been dragging down prices since they peaked at $19,086 on Dec. 17, 2017.   Nolan Bauerle, director of research for CoinDesk, a company that tracks cryptocurrency activity, said that short selling has dried up dramatically just since Wednesday, when 44,000 short positions were open for bitcoin. He said that number dropped to 26,000 short positions on Thursday.   ""There was definitely a short squeeze,"" said Bauerle. ""We do know that this huge volume of short positions closed up simultaneously to that spike in price.""   Garrick Hileman, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Mosaic, said that in addition to the end of tax season related selling and the short squeeze, the surge in digital currency might also be driven by ""heightened geopolitical tensions.""   He said that President Trump's rhetoric about bombing Syria might be contributing to the cryptocurrency rally.   CoinDesk's Bauerle said the threat of war and other threats of instability, like the Brexit vote in 2016, have driven the price of cryptocurreny in the past.   ""We have noticed the trend of bitcoin acting as a crisis currency,"" he said. "
151,151,Are apps a good way to get started investing?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/05/pf/investing-apps/index.html,"Apr 5, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   You've probably seen any number of investing apps in the news, on Instagram or in the app store. They look easy, simple and even fun. But are apps like Robinhood, Stash or Acorns good introductions for a beginner investor? How does a beginner figure out where to start?   Related links: I'm 23. How do I start investing?   Here's how experts recommend picking the platform that's right for you.      Before you start investing, you need to be in relatively OK financial shape. That means crafting (and sticking to) a budget, paying your monthly expenses, making an emergency fund and saving for retirement.   A lot of novices assume investing can make you money quickly — a common mistake, says Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, senior vice president at Charles Schwab.   ""A lot of young people don't even know what they're asking,"" she says. ""They can say 'I want to invest' but 'invest' is broadly used. They hear from their friends 'invest in bitcoin' or 'invest in Spotify.'""   Related: 3 ways bots can boost your money   Schwab-Pomerantz's advice: think of investing as a way to reach a long-term goal, not a way to pay for your next summer vacation.   ""You really shouldn't tap that money for five years, because the market goes up and goes down,"" she says. ""You don't want to be forced to sell something when it's going down just because you need the money.""        You need to learn the basics of investing in order to compare apps and figure out which one is right for you.   These platforms aren't all created equal. Some charge fees; some don't. Some have $500 minimums; others let you get started with a mere $5.   ""In terms of the investment platforms and the companies you use, you must always do your homework,"" says Rachel Rabinovich, director of financial planning at Society of Grownups, which offers advising services and courses for young investors.   Rabinovich says many of these apps do a great job explaining the basics. Apps like Stash even include articles and guides to break down the basics of the market. (CNN has a guide to getting started here.)   Once you've learned about concepts like trading commissions and expense ratios, individual stocks and exchange-traded funds, asset allocations and more, you can start reviewing the options.       If you don't have a lot of cash to get started, look into a ""micro-investing"" platform, like Acorns or Stash. These specialize in ""fractional investing,"" meaning you can buy into part of an exchange-traded fund. So even if you can't buy a full share, for example, your Acorns portfolio can get you started investing with only a few cents.   If you have a little bit more to invest and care about what your money supports, options like Swell and Betterment offer socially-conscious portfolios that invest in renewable energy, clean tech and more.   While more than three million people use Robinhood, the commission-free stock trading app, Rabinovich says this is an option for a more ""sophisticated"" investor. Because Robinhood allows you to select particular stocks — and you can even invest in cryptocurrencies — it requires a bit more investing know-how. Many of the other options will do the investment picking for you.   Remember that you don't need a ton of money to invest. As long as you're managing your money well in other areas of your life, there's no such thing as starting too soon.   ""For a college student who has the means and the desire to start investing and start learning about it, I say go for it,"" Rabinovich says. "

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Russia investigation Special counsel Robert Mueller's team last year made clear it wanted former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates' help, not so much against his former business partner Paul Manafort but with its central mission: investigating the Trump campaign's contact with the Russians. New information disclosed in court filings and to CNN this week begins to show how they're getting it. The public saw the first signs of how the Mueller team plans to use information from Gates to tie Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, directly to a Russian intelligence agency. Mueller's team alleges that Gates was in contact with a close colleague of Manafort's who worked for a Russian intelligence agency -- and that Gates knew of the spy service ties in September and October 2016, while he worked on the Trump campaign.  2. Syria President Trump said US troops would be getting out of Syria ""very soon."" Well, that's news to the Pentagon. Trump made his remarks in Ohio at an event on infrastructure. The President said, ""We're knocking the hell out of ISIS"" and it was time to ""let the other people"" deal with Syria. A defense official said it's just not clear what Trump meant, since he spoke just hours after the Pentagon highlighted numerous challenges in Syria, saying now's not the time to get out. 3. Race and policing Austin's police chief called the Austin bomber a domestic terrorist; Stephon Clark was laid to rest in Sacramento. They were big developments in two of the biggest stories in a tragedy-filled month that says a lot about race and justice in the US. Anger had grown in Austin over the notion that the actions of bomber Mark Anthony Conditt, which led to the deaths of two African-Americans, weren't being called terrorism because he was white, so the chief's new view is significant. Meanwhile, Clark's attorney plans to reveal independent autopsy results today. Sacramento's been hit with protests since he was shot and killed by police in his grandmother's backyard. Cops had pursued him after getting reports of a man breaking into cars and thought he was pointing a gun at them, but only a cell phone was found near his body. Protesters say it's another example of police being too quick to fire on black male suspects. Civil right attorney Benjamin Crump says this: ""There's an intellectual justification to always exonerate the police when they kill black people. We have to change that."" 4. Pacific coast tragedy The mystery of what happened to the Hart family seems to grow by the day. We know the Harts -- two moms with six adopted kids from Washington state -- took a trip to California. The family's SUV was found Monday at the bottom of a cliff on the Northern California coast, having tumbled 100 feet into the Pacific. The bodies of five family members, including the parents, were recovered. But three children are missing, and it's not certain they were even in the vehicle. There were no brake or skid marks at the scene, so it's unclear if this was deliberate or a tragic accident. One of the family's neighbors described the kids as ""repressed,"" and authorities were investigating alleged child abuse and neglect. But others said Jennifer and Sarah Hart were loving moms. One of the missing children, 15-year-old Devonte, appeared in a viral photo in 2014, hugging an officer at a rally against police brutality. 5. 'Serial' new trial The man at the center of the popular ""Serial"" podcast might get a new trial. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals ordered a new trial for Adnan Syed, who's serving a life sentence in the death of his ex-girlfriend. His conviction was vacated in 2016 amid claims his trial lawyer failed to cross-examine an expert witness. The state appealed the 2016 order, leading to Thursday's ruling. But it's not a done deal. Prosecutors have 30 days to appeal or proceed with a new trial. Syed's case burst into public view in 2014 when ""Serial"" -- which has been downloaded 40 million times -- explored a possible alibi.

The digital currency has slumped roughly 50% since the start of the year, dropping below $7,000 on Friday morning in Asia. Less than four months ago, it was trading close to $20,000.   The latest losses follow moves to step up regulation of cryptocurrencies in Europe and Asia.   In Japan, two virtual currency exchanges closed down this week amid increasing scrutiny from the country's financial services watchdog. The trading platforms, Mr Exchange and Tokyo Gateway, both failed to secure a license from Japan's Financial Services Agency.   The ""regulatory clampdown in Japan is a massive negative,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at currency broker Oanda.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Japan is one of the countries where trading in bitcoin and other digital currencies exploded last year, helping to drive up prices as mom-and-pop investors piled in.   Almost half of recent global trading in bitcoin was carried out in Japanese yen, according to industry website CryptoCompare.   The Japanese government officially recognized bitcoin as a form of currency last year and started licensing exchanges. But regulators have stepped up scrutiny of the industry after about $530 million in digital currency was stolen from an exchange in January.   New rules in Europe that limit the amount of money that investors can borrow to trade cryptocurrencies could also be weighing on bitcoin's price, said Innes, who is betting it has further to fall.   Other popular virtual currencies such as Ethereum and Ripple have also slumped recently.   Related: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?   Bitcoin has faced a number of other setbacks this year.   Earlier this week, Twitter (TWTR) announced that it would no longer be running ads tied to cryptocurrencies. Both Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) have announced similar bans on ads, including for initial coin offerings, a fundraising method using cryptocurrencies.

In the script, Deadpool is charged with protecting Sudan, the male northern white rhino whose death last week put into question the future of an entire endangered subspecies.  At one point, Deadpool, who is being paid for his efforts in bitcoin, begins confiding to the rhino.  ""I don't know why I'm here either! I think the writer's just mad. Or bored,"" he says. ""We'll find out together I guess.""  Later, he says, ""You know, I'm not mad about this whole 'cancelled' thing. I actually think it's a good thing. I mean, is it even a good time to have a violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV?""  He adds: ""Other than the PRESIDENT!""  Glover's script, complete with references to the Beyoncé biting incident that has captivated the internet this week, insinuated his material may have been too edgy for Marvel.  ""It just feels like everyone wants something different, but no one wants to do anything different to get it,"" Deadpool moans.  At another point, he asks: ""Do you think they cancelled the show...cause of racism?""  ""Yeah, but all the writers were black. And the references were pretty black, too. I heard they went over the lunch budget ordering Jamaican food at least once a week,"" Deadpool said. The animated series was announced back in May 2017 and was set to debut in 2018 on FXX. Deadpool fans will have to get their fix of the foul-mouthed hero at the theater when the sequel debuts in May. Glover, meanwhile, is currently starring on the second season of his FX series ""Atlanta."" He also plays young Lando in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" and voices Simba in the live-action ""Lion King"" film. "

Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for providing technology for other companies in sectors ranging from bitcoin mining to self-driving cars, but it also has its own fleet of self-driving cars, used for research and development purposes.   The move to pause the tests comes nearly two weeks after a self-driving Uber car, which incorporates Nvidia technology in its self-driving vehicles, struck and killed a woman in Arizona.   Nvidia said Tuesday it will halt testing of its cars until it learns more about the incident, in which 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg was killed while walking her bicycle across a street.   ""Ultimately AVs will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement sent to CNN on Tuesday. ""Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.""   A source familiar with the situation said that Nvidia's decision was made ""out of respect for what happened"" last week and not because the company believes its technology to be unsafe.   Related: Why is everyone so excited about Nvidia?   Uber proactively suspended self-driving operations in all cities following the accident.   Last week, Toyota also halted its self-driving car testing. "
156,156,Bitcoin plunges as social media cracks down on cryptocurrency ads,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/27/investing/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-ads-banned/index.html,"Mar 27, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Bitcoin (XBT) briefly fell below $8,000 because of concerns that top social media companies are no longer running ads tied to cryptocurrencies. Twitter (TWTR) is the latest to take action against crypto ads.   The company confirmed in a statement to CNNMoney Tuesday that it has banned ads for initial coin offerings and token sales.   Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, allow companies to raise money, often by crowdfunding, through the sale of their own cryptocurrencies or digital tokens.   Google (GOOGL) said earlier this month that it will begin restricting some crypto ads in June.   And Facebook (FB) announced in January that it was prohibiting the sale of ads that ""promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices"" -- which included ICOs and bitcoin.   Related: Google to ban crytpocurrency ads   The moves come as regulators around the world, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, warn that some ICOs are scams and have begun to crack down on alleged ICO fraud.   Some publicly traded companies have decided to cash in on the crypto craze. A small beverage company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Co. changed its name to Long Blockchain, (LBCC) and Kodak (KODK) launched its own KodakCoin crytpocurrency.   To that end, the Twitter spokesperson said the company would prohibit the ICO and token ads around the world to ensure ""the safety of the Twitter community.""   The ban on crypto ads is clearly taking a toll on bitcoin as well as other popular cryptocurrenies such as ethereum, litecoin and ripple.   But is the selling overdone? There is a difference between bitcoin and sketchy ICOs from tiny companies.   ""There is no doubt that we are way oversold,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a report Tuesday. He was referring to bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies as well. And he thinks bitcoin may soon hit a bottom.   ""Most of the investors that we are talking to, they only want to buy at [the] current price,"" Aslam said.   Bitcoin has plunged more than 40% this year. Prices were near $20,000 in December. "
157,157,4 things to know about your cryptocurrency at tax time,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/26/pf/how-to-pay-taxes-on-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Mar 26, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Now they could be staring down some major tax liabilities. But how tax laws apply to virtual currencies like bitcoin and ethereum is still a gray area that confuses people.   ""I think a lot of people who got in to cryptocurrency maybe didn't even think about the tax implications,"" says Janna Herron, a tax researcher and writer at Value Penguin.   The Internal Revenue Service says virtual currency transactions are taxable by law. The agency issued its first and only guidance on how tax principles apply to transactions using cryptocurrency in 2014.   ""The one notice is considered tax authority,"" says Sarah-Jane Morin, an attorney in the tax practice group at Morgan Lewis. ""It isn't as binding as regulations, but it is all we have to go on.""   The guidance says that for tax purposes, cryptocurrencies should be treated as property, not currency. And cryptocurrencies, in this guidance, include anything that is considered a ""convertible virtual currency,"" which means it has an equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for real currency. Not all cryptocurrencies act this way, but most of the major ones, like bitcoin, do.   ""Some people with bitcoin may think of it as dollars or cash,"" says Morin. ""But for IRS purposes it should be treated as a house, stocks, bonds. You have to look at the general tax principles that apply to property and how it impacts your gains or losses.""   Basically, if you bought bitcoin and haven't sold, you haven't realized any gain. You probably don't have any reporting obligations.   But if you sold bitcoin — or any other cryptocurrency — in the last year, you'll need to report the gains and losses. Here's how.      ""Usually on sales of stocks or bonds, your brokerage firm or bank will send you a 1099 tax form,"" says Herron. ""That's not the case for all crytpo-exchanges or most transactions.""   Coinbase will only issue the statement if you've realized $20,000 in gains and had at least 200 transactions.   It is a high bar designed for major players, not your casual investor who wandered into bitcoin recently.   ""What that means is the onus is on you to figure out the tax obligations,"" says Herron.      Since the IRS determines cryptocurrencies to be property, like stocks or real estate, you'll need to pay taxes if you've realized a capital gain and you can lower your tax bill if you've taken a loss.   You'll need to gather the following information: 1) when you bought the crypto, 2) how much you paid for it, 3) when you sold it, and 4) what you received for it.   ""I don't think the average person realizes that they needed to track their basis,"" says Morin, which is the original value of an asset for tax purposes.   Usually the basis is the the purchase price, but it is adjusted for things like splits, dividends and return of capital distributions. You'll need the basis to determine the capital gain, or the difference between the asset's cost basis and the current market value.   This can become very confusing if you made various purchases at different times. ""Generally, you want to apply a ""first in, first out"" principal,"" says Morin.   Alternatively, you could use websites aimed at helping bitcoin investors determine their tax liabilities. Bitcoin.tax and Cointracking.info will help you figure out your transaction history, how much you owe and how to fill out the Schedule D (1040) form for reporting capital gains or losses.      It may occur to you that if no one is reporting your captial gains to the IRS, no one really knows about your investments.   ""It is never a good idea to try to skip out on your taxes,"" says Herron. ""You really don't want to hide anything from the IRS. In the future they may discover that you owe, there will be penalties and fines involved in that.""   Even though the notice on cryptocurrencies is guidance and not regulation, it does comment on penalties.   ""It says that taxpayers may be subject to penalties for not reporting,"" says Morin. ""The best way to avoid penalties is to do the best you can with the reporting. That will show that you didn't have a willful intent to avoid taxes.""   In some extreme situations, ""taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution for failing to properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions,"" the IRS said in a statement released Friday.   And the penalties are steep: anyone convicted of tax evasion, for example, is subject to a prison term of up to 5 years and a fine of up to $250,000.      This year you may be stuck with a suboptimal situation in which you're looking through receipts and statements and emails trying to get all your information together.   ""Going forward, it would probably be easier to keep detailed records of what you bought and when you bought it,"" Morin says.   In addition to keeping records of your virtual currency transactions, it's a good idea to set aside money each time you make a taxable trade to compensate for the tax associated with that transaction.   No one is going to tell you to do it, but you'll be responsible for the consequences if you don't.   ""Go with the idea that it will be up to you and you need to keep those records to stay on the right side of Uncle Sam,"" says Herron. "
158,158,The FBI is investigating a ransomware attack on the city of Atlanta,http://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/us/atlanta-ransomware-attack/index.html,"Mar 22, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Atlanta's mayor on Thursday urged anyone with personal information in city information systems to check their financial records as an investigation continues into a ransomware attack on the city. Ransomware is a malicious software that prevents or limits users from accessing their system by locking them out until a ransom is paid. NBC affiliate WXIA reported that the city received a ransom demand in bitcoin for $6,800 per unit or $51,000 to unlock the entire system. CNN has not independently confirmed the report. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees to contact credit agencies and monitor their bank accounts in case their personal data was compromised. She urged the public to take the same precautions while investigators work to determine the scope of the attack. ""We don't know the extent so we just ask that you be vigilant,"" Bottoms said in a Thursday news conference. ""All of us are subject to this attack, if you will. Many of us pay our bills online, we have direct deposit, so go online and check your bank statements.""  Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Richard Cox confirmed that the city received a written demand related to the attack. When asked in the news conference if the city was going to pay a ransom, Bottoms said, ""We can't speak to that right now."" ""We will be looking for guidance from, specifically, our federal partners on how to best navigate the best course of action,"" she said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security are investigating the cyberattack, which Atlanta Information Management officials learned of Thursday at 5:40 a.m., Cox said. DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency offered technical expertise and support and referred questions to the city. The city announced outages earlier Thursday to various customer-facing applications, including those used to pay bills and access court-related information. Thursday afternoon, Cox said several departments were affected, too. Some city data remains encrypted while investigators continue to determine the scope of the attack, he said. The city's payroll has not been affected, he said. Public safety and water services are operating without incident. The city engaged Microsoft and a team from Cisco's Incident Response Services in the investigation, Deputy Chief Information Officer Daphne Rackley said.  When asked if the city was aware of vulnerabilities and failed to take action, Rackley said the city had implemented measures in the past that might have lessened the scope of the breach. She cited a ""cloud strategy"" to migrate critical systems to secure infrastructure. ""This is not a new issue to the state of Georgia, it's not a new issue to our country. We have been taking active measures to mitigate any risk in the past."" In the meantime, the mayor urged caution. ""We don't know if it's limited to information related to just our employees or if it's more extensive than that. But because we don't know I think that it would be appropriate for the public just to be vigilant in checking their accounts and making sure your credit agencies also have been notified."" "
159,159,"How Facebook, the ultimate disrupter, could be disrupted",http://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/opinions/facebook-privacy-blockchain-opinion-parker/index.html,"Mar 20, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Emily Parker is a former writer at The Wall Street Journal and the author of ""Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground."" She is also a former member of the Policy Planning staff at the US State Department. Parker is currently working on a blockchain startup. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.  (CNN)Facebook is under fire for allowing a Trump-affiliated firm, Cambridge Analytica, to access the private information of 50 million users. Facebook did not inform those users that their personal data was being harvested in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election.  This raises many disturbing questions about Facebook. For starters, why does one platform have so much control over the personal data of billions of people?  But this is part of a much larger story. Not long ago, a handful of internet companies threatened to overturn the old order. Facebook challenged traditional media. Platforms like Uber, Netflix and Airbnb disrupted taxis, movie theaters and hotels. Now, these once-rebellious upstarts have become extremely powerful, and they know way too much about us.  People are getting tired of it. This helps explain why you keep hearing the word ""blockchain."" Blockchain technology, among other things, could potentially make platforms like Facebook obsolete. Many people know blockchain as the decentralized record of bitcoin (a virtual currency) transactions. It is the technology that allows digital money to circulate around the globe, without the help of banks or governments. In other words, blockchain cuts out the middleman, and this technology can be applied to many different industries.  Imagine if you, not Facebook, controlled your own data. Or if you could rent out your apartment easily and securely, without paying a cent to Airbnb. If readers could buy digital books directly from authors and filmmakers could know how many times their movies were viewed. Musicians would be able to keep better track of when their songs were played, and get paid accordingly. Taxi drivers would transact directly with passengers without Uber knowing everyone's location. In their new book, ""The Truth Machine,"" Michael Casey and Paul Vigna describe how companies like Uber, Airbnb and Facebook have become examples of entrenched monopoly power. Blockchain technologies ""aim to do away with these intermediaries altogether, letting people forge their own trust to build social networks and business arrangements on their own terms."" In the case of Bitcoin, the blockchain is not stored on a central server, but is continuously updated by computers all over the world. Blockchain transactions are verified by many participants, known as miners, who receive Bitcoins as a reward for their work.  The blockchain is also public, and can be viewed by anyone at any time. That means that the blockchain cannot be altered without people noticing. Think of it kind of like Wikipedia, but for financial transactions.  Bitcoin was invented to be free of centralized control -- in an attempt to create a currency that was independent of the banking system. Bitcoin allows people to accumulate assets without worrying that a central bank will devalue their currency, or that their money will be confiscated by authorities.  And yes, because Bitcoin can be sent without using your real name, it can be used for criminal activity. But blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, not anonymous. You can see every Bitcoin transaction, but not the individuals making them. Because all Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain, they are still more traceable than cash.    The creation of Bitcoin inspired innovations like Ethereum, a computing network that also uses blockchain technology. People can use Ethereum to create smart contracts that are executed by algorithms, rather than human beings. These contracts are recorded on the blockchain, making them both public and immutable. Complete strangers can automatically exchange digital currency once the terms of a contract are met, eliminating the need of a trusted intermediary. Blockchain technology records and time-stamps every transaction, making them visible for the world to see. The ability to trace the flow of digital assets could be game-changing for artists. Right now, filmmakers don't know how many times their movies are watched online, perhaps because that data is held by a company like Netflix. This opacity would be much more difficult in a blockchain world.  Blockchain also enhances data privacy. This may seem like a contradiction: How can something be both private and transparent? As Don and Alex Tapscott explain in their book, ""Blockchain Revolution,"" people decide how much information to attach to their identity.  Because this information is stored on the blockchain, which exists everywhere, there are no ""honey pots"" of personal data to hack into. No single company like Facebook has access to your private information, and they can't hand that information over to a third party without your permission. Nor could companies sell your data without you receiving a penny in return. ""Because you own your data, you can monetize it,"" the Tapscotts explain. ""You share in the wealth of big data.""   This may all sound too good to be true. Skepticism is warranted, as the blockchain hype is certainly excessive. In one amusing case, Long Island Iced Tea's shares soared by over 200% after adding the word ""blockchain"" to their name. But the froth over blockchain reveals a real frustration with the current internet, which was supposed to be a decentralizing force. You see this frustration in the backlash against Facebook, in musicians' grief over YouTube and Spotify eating away at their income, and in the scandals over companies like Uber employing user data to track journalists.   Blockchain will not solve the world's problems, but perhaps it can deliver on some of the goals that our current internet has failed to achieve. Internet companies were supposed to put more power into the hands of individuals, but it hasn't always worked out that way. People are ready to disrupt the disrupters.  "
160,160,What's the best place for your money in the next five years?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/15/pf/where-to-put-your-money/index.html,"Mar 15, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Finding a safe harbor for your money in the short- to mid-term creates a challenging check list.   You want your money to take on more risk and earn you more than if it were just hanging out in your savings account, earning hardly anything. But you also want it to be relatively accessible on a five-year timeline. And that's to say nothing of the pitfalls of the current economic environment, in which we're staring down higher interest rates, changing tax situations and trade tensions.   The good news is you can cross a few things off your list right away. Like real estate.   ""When you're looking for liquidity and safety on a horizon of only five years, you don't want to be invested in a piece of real estate that you have to work desperately to get out of in a down market,"" says Derek Green, a broker and investment adviser with Titus Wealth Management in Folsom, California.   Also: Put down the cryptocurrencies.   Sure, there's potential for growth by investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, but the up and down swings in those markets make them too risky for a five year span, according to Green.   ""Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile,"" says Green ""If it has had a period of downside volatility and you have to sell after five years, it isn't going to be a desirable situation.""   So what will keep your money growing with manageable risk in the next half decade?      Given the economic climate, the stock market remains among the best havens for your money. But some stocks may be safer than others, says Green.   ""The small- and mid-caps will likely have more of a tailwind given rising rates, a changing tax situation and trade tensions,"" says Green. ""Rather than the larger, internationally-oriented companies in the S&P 500.""   A small-cap, or a stock with a small ""capitalization"" as determined by the total market value of its shares, is stock of companies that generally have a market capitalization between $300 million to $2 billion. Mid-cap stocks are those between $2 billion and $10 billion. (Large cap stocks are those over $10 billion).   For those looking for something a little safer, Green recommends shorter maturity bonds or a short-term bond exchange traded fund. A shorter duration means less credit risk and less interest rate risk. And those are both good things in a rising interest rate market.        Looking beyond investments, Green advises finding somewhere other than your savings account for the money.   ""You're probably going to lag behind the rate of inflation in a savings account,"" he says.   Of course, there are high yield savings accounts available. While they tend to be among the safest options with the lowest risk, they offer the lowest returns. Use these only if security and accessibility to the funds is paramount.   Better than savings accounts are CDs, or certificates of deposit, which are insured, timed deposits offered by banks and credit unions that have very low risk, but offer slightly better returns than savings accounts.   ""CDs are getting more attractive as short-term interest rates increase.""   For example, a CD with a five-year term, might carry an annual percentage yield of 2.65%.      Given the relatively short time horizon and the dynamic economic picture, Green advises that you keep your eyes on that money and be a little more proactive with your investments than usual.   The reality is, he says, there are just too many things in play to leave your money alone for very long.   ""We may go from rising interest rates to falling interest rates during that five year cycle,"" says Green. ""I would recommend semi-annual to annual rebalancing of the portfolio.""

161,161,Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with massive fraud,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/14/technology/theranos-fraud-scandal/index.html,"Mar 14, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Former president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani was also charged. The two raised money from investors ""through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology, business, and financial performance,"" the SEC said Wednesday.   Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the claims against them, the SEC said. Holmes will give up control of the company and much of her stake in it. The SEC said it would take its case against Balwani to federal court in San Francisco.   Theranos is a Silicon Valley startup once valued at as much as $9 billion. It was formed in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford University to launch the company. It was considered an industry disruptor that aimed to create cheaper, more efficient alternatives to traditional medical tests.   But it's been rattled by controversy following a 2015 Wall Street Journal report that questioned its technology and testing methods. The company has since voided two years of blood tests, faced federal probes and pivoted away from blood testing.   Elizabeth Holmes declined to comment through her attorney.   Jeffrey B. Coopersmith, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine who represents Balwani, called the SEC action against his client ""unwarranted.""   ""Sunny Balwani accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability,"" Coopersmith said in a statement.   Coopersmith said Balwani invested millions of his own dollars into Theranos and ""never benefited financially from his work at the company.""   Theranos' independent directors issued a statement, saying ""the company is pleased to be bringing this matter to a close and looks forward to advancing its technology.""   According to the complaint against Theranos and Holmes, she and Balwani knew that its proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu, something the Wall Street Journal hinted at in its first expose on the company.   Related: Former Equifax chairman charged with insider trading   The SEC said Theranos misled partners about its technology, and it allegedly used modified third-party machinery instead of its own to process some tests. The SEC also said it lied about revenue projections and claimed to investors that regulatory approval for its testing technology was voluntary when it wasn't.   Theranos compiled a binder for investors that included reports on clinical trials it said it had performed with pharmaceutical companies. But only one of the reports was co-written with a pharmaceutical client, according to the complaint. Two were written by Theranos employees.   Moreover, Theranos and Holmes made ""false and misleading statements"" in press accounts to bolster the startup's profile.   It then allegedly used those articles to generate financial interest. ""In some instances, she and Theranos provided some of the articles containing untrue or misleading statements to potential investors,"" the complaint states.   The company was also said to be ""on the verge of bankruptcy"" in late 2017.   Theranos' reputation was inflated over the years with the help of some profile figures, including former secretary of states, Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, former secretary of defense William Perry, and senators Bill Frist and Sam Nunn -- all were once board members.   Related: Bitcoin plunges after SEC seeks to rein in cryptocurrencies   Current secretary of Defense James Mattis, a former Theranos board member, cut ties with the startup ahead of his 2017 confirmation hearing.   Their ties with the company could have helped Holmes make it seem plausible that Theranos had a history of working with the Department of Defense -- something touted to mislead investors, according to the SEC.   In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of the publication's parent company 21st Century Fox, had invested $100 million in Theranos. But he'd never been publicly linked to the startup.   One of the Therano's investors sued the company the same year for its $96.1 million in funding money back after alleging securities fraud. The investment firm invested in the startup in February 2014.   At the time, Theranos released a statement: ""The suit is without merit, the assertions are baseless, and the plaintiff is engaging in revisionist history.""   The lawsuit between Theranos and Partner Fund Management was settled last year. "

The search company said Wednesday that it will ban ads that promote cryptocurrencies starting in June, part of an effort to clear unregulated financial products off its platform.   The move follows similar steps by Facebook (FB) -- a big rival for advertising dollars -- which shelved all virtual currency ads in January.   Related: What is bitcoin?

Google said it would also ban ads for some other risky financial products, like binary options, which offer investors all-or-nothing returns.   Facebook said earlier this year that its restrictions were designed to prevent scammers taking advantage of users.

Russian fitness fanatics Oleg Fomenko and Anton Derlyatka came up with the idea in 2015 when Fomenko had lost the motivation to work out after his previous startup went under.   The London-based pair, both in their 40s, realized the problem with getting people to exercise is the human tendency to prioritize immediate pleasure over long-term gain.   ""We started talking about how we can use modern technology to give you instant gratification"" for physical activity, Fomenko said.   In 2016, they founded Sweatcoin. The app pays users 0.95 sweatcoins for every 1,000 steps they take outdoors. That digital currency can be traded for fitness gear, giftcards and workout classes in the app's marketplace.   About 20,000 sweatcoins -- that's just over 21 million steps -- can be exchanged for an iPhone X.   ""If you remember that your steps can be converted into something valuable, you're slightly more likely to walk rather than take a bus,"" Derlyatka said.   Some users have complained, though, that it can take a long time to accrue enough sweatcoins to purchase the more appealing items -- and that sometimes the ones they're really interested in have disappeared by the time they reach the required amount.   Related: How a top actor went from action movies to baking cookies      Available in the US and the UK, the app now has 10 million users. Its creators say that its success hinged on making sure the step-counting technology was watertight.   ""We realized that as soon as you turn movement into currency, into value, you are automatically attracting a lot of gaming, a lot of falsification,"" Fomenko said. ""We have thousands of people who attempt to game us every day.""   To stop people cheating, Sweatcoin uses a cellphone's inbuilt step sensor to track movement. An algorithm then checks the phone's readings for speed, consistency of movement and location to eliminate any false data.   Related: The digital bank that's wowing its users    Currently, the app only tracks outdoor steps, as the founders say these are easier to verify. They are developing an algorithm to detect real and falsified indoor steps with help from researchers at the University of Warwick.     About 300 brands give products to Sweatcoin's marketplace for free, hoping to expose their goods to relevant consumers, explained Derlyatka.   In July, Sweatcoin began asking brands to pay it a fee when a user buys one of their products through the app. It says revenue has grown quickly but making a profit ""is not a priority at this point.""      The company started out as a health app, but its future lies in the world of cryptocurrencies, according to its founders.   ""A lot of people portray us as a cool, funky, gamey app. Probably it is, but this is just a stepping stone, the ultimate vision is the currency,"" Derlyatka said.   Related: This app is fighting food waste and offering free meals    In January, the company secured $5.7 million in funding to help finance its plans, enabling it to double its number of employees to 20.   Fomenko and Derlyatka want to expand globally and develop the technology to allow people to trade sweatcoins, much like bitcoin and other other cryptocurrencies.   The founders even hope that one day people will pay taxes with sweatcoins.   ""We are a really powerful tool for the government and healthcare system to motivate citizens to be more active and as a result save more money,"" Derlyatka said. "

Hardest hit: Rachel Whetstone, the former head of Uber PR who is now a communications VP at Facebook:   • ""Whetstone... had a reputation inside the company as being difficult to work with, becoming easily upset, or even irrational. She routinely threatened to quit, but would then cool down and change her mind.""   • Kalanick's circle believed ""Uber's real problem was its PR team... Not only was Whetstone doing a poor job of defending the company, they believed, she was riling other employees and stirring up gossip.""   • Whetstone ""suggested [that Uber] hire former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder [to investigate allegations of sexual harassment against the company]... Kalanick didn't realize it at the time, but he had... hired his executioner.""   (Whetstone did not comment for the piece).   Got off easiest: Bill Gurley, the Benchmark VC who led the effort to fire Kalanick.   • Bort reports that Gurley panicked in the wake of Uber's controversies, but says he ""was in a lose-lose situation"" due to mounting pressure from Uber investors.   • Some in Kalanick's circle would argue that Gurley showed no backbone and was more worried about protecting his own reputation than fighting for Kalanick.   The Big Picture: Even the most innovative companies are at the mercy of human egos and human imperfection. Smart leaders and effective deputies are a rare commodity.

165,165,Ransomware experiment shows the dangers of hacking robots,http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/09/technology/robots-ransomware/index.html,"Mar 9, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Researchers at security firm IOActive have successfully conducted a ransomware attack on a SoftBank Robotics NAO humanoid robot.   Designed for schools and businesses, NAO and its more popular sibling Pepper are robots equipped with microphones and cameras. They're typically used in classrooms, retail stores, and offices for customer assistance.   After installing ransomware on the robot, the security firm was able to get it to demand bitcoin. The researchers could modify system files and the robot's behavior, such as forcing it to say threatening messages.   The team also noted a hacked robot's potential ability to steal stored data, say curse words, or display controversial content such as pornography if it has a screen.   ""Ransomware for robots is a real threat with potentially huge economic implications for businesses -- even more than regular ransomware,"" the researchers wrote in a report published Friday.   Related: Why ransomware costs small businesses big money   As robots become increasingly commonplace, from smart speakers like Amazon Echo to manufacturing plants, it's a reminder of the threats that could disrupt our lives.   In IOActive's case, the ransomware installation required the same Wi-Fi network as the robot. This means the hack had to take place nearby; if a robot is connected to a retail store's public internet, a hacker would need access to its Wi-Fi network to compromise the device.   The experiment followed IOActive's work last year that discovered 50 vulnerabilities in robots manufactured by a number of vendors, including SoftBank Robotics. To further their research, IOActive created a proof-of-concept ransomware attack on the NAO robot. Because it was developed in a similar way, the attack would also likely work on Pepper.   IOActive said researchers alerted SoftBank Robotics to the security issues in January 2017, but the company has not yet fixed the flaws.   ""When in use of Pepper, we ask to maintain the wifi network security, and also to set the robot passwords correctly. We will continue to improve our security measures on Pepper, so we can counter any risks we may face,"" the firm said in a statement.   The researchers said fixing a robot controlled by ransomware requires a specialized technician. A robot owner might have to send the robot back to the vendor for repairs, which could be costly.   The financial cost of general ransomware on businesses is significant. Small businesses can lose hundreds thousands of dollars and days of productivity due to disruptions in their services. At large corporations, the cost can be even higher.   Last year, the WannaCry ransomware attack shut down hospitals in the UK, which were forced to turn patients away due to computer issues. The malware also infected a Honda plant in Japan and disrupted vehicle production.   Although the IOActive research didn't harm a business or consumer, it's an example of the potential issues of robots and connected devices. The more gadgets become a part of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) -- which includes products like internet-connected lightbulbs, smart TVs and speakers -- the more opportunities hackers have to conduct cyberattacks.   ""Robots are IoT on steroids,"" said Cesar Cerrudo, CTO at IOActive. ""And the impact of ransomware is much bigger, as it directly affects business production and services."" "

The country's Financial Services Agency on Thursday ordered Bitstation and FSHO to suspend their operations for at least a month. The regulator said a Bitstation executive had used some customer funds for personal transactions, while FSHO is accused of not adequately protecting its customers.   Neither exchange immediately responded to requests for comment.   The Japanese regulator also imposed ""administrative penalties"" on five other exchanges, ordering them to strengthen their internal management and make other improvements to their operations.   Related: Bitcoin plunges after SEC seeks to rein in cryptocurrencies   Those exchanges include Coincheck, which lost an estimated $530 million from user accounts in a hack in late January. The cyber heist is believed to be the largest cryptocurrency theft on record, surpassing the estimated $400 million stolen from another Japan-based exchange, Mt Gox, in 2014.   Coincheck promised it would reimburse most of the money its users lost in the hack from its own funds.   Related: Cryptocurrency regulation is 'inevitable,' says IMF chief   The exchange said after Thursday's regulatory order that it would conduct ""a drastic review of internal and business management"" to better protect its customers.

The SEC warned on Wednesday of ""potentially unlawful online platforms for trading digital assets."" The federal agency said that cryptocurrency traders should only buy and sell them on exchanges registered with the SEC.   ""If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an 'exchange,' as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration,"" said the SEC.   The announcement sent Bitcoin, the most well-known and highly-priced cryptocurrency, on a tailspin, dipping 9% to below $10,000, about half the value it was trading at last year, according to Coindesk.com. Ethereum and Litecoin also made significant declines.   Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses a technology called blockchain. The SEC said that many cryptocurrencies, and also coins and tokens offered through a fundraising method known as an Initial Coin Offering, meet the government's definition of a security. Trading platforms for cryptocurrencies are therefore subject to federal regulations and must be registered with the SEC.   This could really shake up the market, according to Todd Kornfeld, a financial services attorney at Pepper Hamilton.   ""Liquidity is important for many holders of tokens, coins and cryptocurrencies, and if this SEC activity reduces access to the existing token, coin and cryptocurrency markets, that could result in increased volatility in the trading and pricing of tokens, coins and cryptocurrencies,"" Kornfeld said.   Related: SEC warns investors of 'potential scams' involving ICOs   The SEC also warned that some of the unregistered, and therefore illegal, online trading platforms can appear to be legitimate.   ""The SEC staff has concerns that many online trading platforms appear to investors as SEC-registered and regulated marketplaces when they are not,"" said the SEC. ""Many platforms refer to themselves as 'exchanges,' which can give the misimpression to investors that they are regulated or meet the regulatory standards of a national securities exchange.""   Related: Bitcoin traders charged with fraud   But the volatility and the SEC scrutiny shouldn't come as a surprise to those scrutinizing these markets, said Kornfeld. The SEC warned investors last year to be on the lookout for ""potential scams"" involving ICOs. It busted ""pump and dump"" schemes, in which alleged fraudsters lure investors, take their money, and run.   ""It's not surprising that this has happened,"" said Kornfeld.

A never-ending GIF of a dumpster, on fire, in reference to some ongoing, seemingly chronic calamity: a sport team's awful season, a tech firm's catastrophic product launch, a presidential candidate's chaotic campaign. Now, you can use the term ""dumpster fire"" with renewed authority because Merriam-Webster added it -- along with 850 other words and definitions -- to its dictionary. Once reserved for use by sports radio hosts and social media hipsters, it now can emit from the lips and fingertips of the hip and unhip alike. Indeed, an entity as esteemed as the American Dialect Society deemed the phrase its word of the year for 2016. The new official definition of dumpster fire is ""an utterly calamitous or mismanaged situation or occurrence."" That's how the phrase has been used since it first flickered into public consciousness about a decade ago. Merriam-Webster says its first known use occurred in 2008. A writer at NPR called dumpster fire a ""phrase for our time,"" and she's right. How else could you describe our bewildering era: when presidents pay off porn stars (and everybody shrugs) and we have to prepare for wicked storms called bomb cyclones and the NFL's winless Cleveland Browns (0-16, baby!) earn the No. 1 seed in the draft, and then try to trade it away. That's just crazy. Yes, dumpster fire. You've more than earned your place in our national lexicon. Here are some other words and definitions that Merriam-Webster just added: Wordie -- ""a lover of words."" You mean that wasn't already in there? Embiggen -- ""to make bigger or more expansive."" Have to admit, we hadn't heard of this one. Blockchain -- ""a digital database containing information (such as records of financial transactions) that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network."" You can't be one of those Bitcoin billionaires if you don't understand the technology. Harissa -- ""a spicy North African paste made from dried chilies, salt, oil, and other seasonings."" Mmmmm.

We'll take two. Mansplain -- ""to explain something to a woman in a condescending way that assumes she has no knowledge about the topic."" In other words guys, just zip it. Glamping -- ""outdoor camping with amenities and comforts."" 'Cause there's nothing like roughing it with a bed, electricity and indoor plumbing. Unicorn -- No, not THAT kind of unicorn.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Sam Nunberg Insane. Jaw-dropping. Mystifying. Just a few of the adjectives people used to try to describe what former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg did yesterday. Nunberg is refusing to comply with a grand jury subpoena in the Russia investigation. ""Screw that,"" he told CNN's Gloria Borger. So, while he doesn't want to talk with investigators, he had no problems talking with journalists. If a TV was on Monday afternoon, Nunberg was on it, appearing on news shows daring special counsel Robert Mueller to arrest him. He also said he believes Mueller has ""something"" on Trump. White House staffers, who try their best to tune out the Russia probe, were reportedly transfixed by Nunberg's performance. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said he was misguided. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin reminded everyone that a subpoena is a not a birthday party invitation and can't be ignored. So, why is Nunberg doing this? CNN's Chris Cillizza theorizes that he likes the attention but doesn't understand the damage he's doing to himself. And if you want to watch Erin Burnett's bonkers interview with Nunberg -- in which she tells him straight-up she smells alcohol on his breath -- click here.  2. North and South Korea South Korea wants to continue talks with North Korea while at the same time bolstering its military defenses. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said this while a high-level delegation from the South was in Pyongyang talking with the North, including a historic four-hour meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim told the delegation that he wants to ""write a new history of national reunification."" Despite the good vibes, many observers don't think any of this will lead to a breakthrough but instead is just two sides trying to play the best hands they've been dealt amid talk of military action by Washington. 3. Teacher strikes West Virginia's teacher strike hits its ninth day today, after lawmakers failed to agree on a proposed pay raise for educators. Teachers say they won't go back to work until they get a 5% raise. GOP Gov. Jim Justice gave his blessing to that, and the state House OK'd it, but the state Senate only passed a 4% raise, thus the impasse. A legislative conference committee will meet today to try to iron out the differences between the House and Senate bills. Meanwhile in Oklahoma, teachers are also thinking about going on strike, after state lawmakers shot down a bill that would have given them a $5,000 raise. Oklahoma ranks 49th in teacher salaries, and educators say a pay increase is needed to keep teachers from fleeing to other higher-paying states. 4. Syria Russia's offering Syrian rebels and their families safe passage out of Eastern Ghouta, even as the Syrian government continues to pummel the area with shelling. Russia -- the Syrian government's most powerful ally -- has accused the rebels of preventing civilians from leaving the besieged Damascus suburb. A 46-truck aid convoy entered Eastern Ghouta yesterday for the first time with much needed food and medicine. Almost 600 people have been killed since Syria last month launched an air and ground offensive on the rebel-held area. 5. Net neutrality Washington state moved to protect net neutrality as DC aims to get rid of it. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed a law that safeguards net neutrality protections. It bars internet service providers in Washington from blocking content, applications or services on the basis of content or whether they got paid to favor certain traffic. The federal Obama-era rules on net neutrality were repealed by the FCC and will officially end on April 23, though more than 20 states have filed suit to stop that.

""If there is a sudden [order] to withdraw the funds, that would mean trouble for the customers,"" Muppajaru told CNN.   Officials have repeatedly warned Indians not to trade in virtual currencies.

""This has ... put our business under a lot of stress and [is] putting us in a position where we don't feel that we can continue.""   They are switching focus to their consulting business, advising corporate clients adopting the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies.   Mupparaju founded BTCXIndia as a bitcoin exchange in 2014 (he claims it was the country's first) but switched to ripple in March last year after bitcoin's epic price surge made it too expensive for most of his customers. He launched ETHEXIndia in March 2016.

""We are a bit more cautious than other exchanges,"" Mupparaju said. ""The customers' funds are lying with me. If something goes wrong, I am a very small player and I don't have funds lying elsewhere, so I can't take big risks.""

Although the Samsung Galaxy S9 builds on where the Galaxy S8 left off, does it have enough wow factor?   It's certainly not a revolutionary model, but fans may be convinced to upgrade for the camera, better audio for video streaming, and other unique features like ultra-slow motion video.      The brightest spot of Samsung devices has long been its camera. Its latest smartphone is no exception.   The new camera can take sharper photos in challenging lighting conditions than previous models. It has a dual camera and a new dual aperture that works like a human eye to adjust to bright or dark lighting. It makes sure photos are crisp and clear even in difficult lighting, and the aperture can switch between F2.4 and F1.5 to let in more or less light.     A fun slow-motion tool lets users take videos that are 32 times slower than traditional video. This can give you quirky, shareable shots that the phone automatically matches with music. For example, when someone throws confetti in slow motion, the phone pairs the video with upbeat music. (The music can be changed if Samsung misses the mark).      In a bid to take on one of the buzziest new iOS features, Animoji, Samsung's new AR emoji mirror your facial expressions. But the difference is that Samsung's version turns you into a cartoon based on a selfie, similar to the concept behind Snapchat's popular Bitmoji app.   You can customize features like hair and clothing, and add accessories like glasses. They'll appear in 18 pre-set GIFs attached to your keyboard. Users can turn themselves into characters like a bunny or cat, too.   While the personalized AR emoji feature does a solid job of mimicking, the bunny or cat characters were less accurate and expressive during our tests.    The S9 also has a useful live language translation feature that lets scan objects like a sign or a menu. While the tool is virtually the same as an existing feature on Google Translate's app, adding it to Samsung's camera could lead to wider consumer use.   You can hold the camera up to an object and get a fast translation. But the coolest part about it is that it's not giving you subtitles. It overlays the object and virtually deletes the original text, replacing it with your native language via Google Translate. It's available in 54 languages.        Although Samsung has offered facial recognition on its Galaxy devices for a while, it's ramping up its efforts even more to compete with the iPhone X's new Face ID feature.    Its new ""intelligent scan"" tool blends its facial recognition and iris scanner. Depending on the lighting, the tool determines whether to unlock the phone with its iris scanner or facial recognition. The iris scanner, which allows you to open the phone with your eyes, has had challenges working in direct sunlight.       It will be easy for the Samsung Galaxy S9 to stand out at the mobile conference in Spain this week because other major smartphone brands such as Huawei and LG are not expected to launch new flagship phones, according to Thomas Husson, vice president at research firm Forrester.   ""Samsung has a great marketing window of opportunity to claim innovation leadership on the high-end smartphone segment,"" he said.   Related: Samsung is flying high. Here's what could bring it down to earth   Samsung (SSNLF) has surpassed a number of challenges in the past year and a half, including faulty batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 phones and Lee Jae-yong, the company's de facto leader, being found guilty of bribery and other corruption charges. Nevertheless, the company has reported record earnings of $50 billion in 2017. It's also the world's largest smartphone manufacturer and chipmaker.   ""The Note 7 debacle seems to be firmly behind it,"" said David McQueen, research director of consumer devices and strategic technology at ABI Research. ""This doesn't seem to have damaged the brand."" "

Last year's rebranding of Long Island Iced Tea into Long Blockchain symbolized the moment that the bitcoin movement went from a boom to a craze. The bizarre makeover from Long Island beverage company to blockchain powerhouse sent the stock spiking nearly 200% the same day.   Long Blockchain (LBCC), as the company is now known, said in a filing on Wednesday that Nasdaq has accused it of making a series of public statements ""designed to mislead investors.""   Nasdaq wrote a February 15 letter to Long Blockchain saying it believes the company attempted to ""take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology.""   Citing ""concerns about the Company's suitability for exchange listing,"" Nasdaq said it plans to use its ""discretionary authority"" to delist Long Blockchain.   Long Blockchain said it ""strongly disagrees"" with Nasdaq's determination and has appealed the delisting decision. The appeal means the stock, listed under the ticker symbol ""LBCC,"" will continue to trade, for now at least.   On Tuesday, days after the Nasdaq letter, Long Blockchain appointed a new CEO and announced a plan to spin off its beverage business.   Related: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?   The Long Blockchain situation brought back memories of the dotcom bubble, when some companies added ""dotcom"" to their end of their names to seize on the insatiable appetite for internet stocks.   Similarly, the cryptocurrency boom led other companies to change their names and business models. For instance, shares of Bioptix spiked after it transformed from a biotech company to Riot Blockchain (RIOT).   It's not the first time Long Blockchain has run into trouble with Nasdaq.   In October, months before its name change, Long Island Iced Tea was warned by Nasdaq that its market value was so tiny -- below $35 million for 30 days in a row -- that it could be delisted. The exchange gave the company until April 2018 to fix the issue.   The company managed to lift its market value -- dramatically -- but in a way that apparently alarmed Nasdaq.   The plunge in prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has sent Long Blockchain back to levels it was at when it was just an iced tea company.   Long Blockchain said that in order to regain compliance with the Nasdaq's requirements, its market value must remain at $35 million or more for at least 10 straight business days. The current stock price of $3.05 implies a market value of about $30 million.   --CNNMoney's Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report. "
174,174,Cryptojackers are hacking websites to mine cryptocurrencies,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/cryptojacking-mining-tesla-websites/index.html,"Feb 22, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   As bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices soar, ""cryptojacking"" attackers surreptitiously take over web browsers, phones and servers to make some serious profit.   ""Every avenue out there is being exploited on any kind of machine,"" said Jerome Segura, lead malware analyst at security firm Malwarebytes. ""Consumer computers, servers, research centers — it has no bounds. We forecast it to be the biggest threat in 2018.""   Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and Monero, are created by using computing energy to solve complex math problems. When a problem is solved, a new piece of currency is made. This is called mining. Currencies can be mined legitimately, but criminals are increasingly turning to malevolent mining activities.   In September 2017, Malwarebytes began tracking a major uptick in malicious cryptomining and it has become the company's most commonly detected activity.   In the last month alone, cryptojacking campaigns have hit websites belonging to governments, critical infrastructure and even YouTube.   It can affect business infrastructure, too. On Tuesday, researchers at security firm RedLock said Tesla's cloud storage — a place for storing data separate from physical Tesla servers — was recently breached to mine cryptocurrency.   A spokesperson for the car manufacturer said there was no indication customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised.   But businesses should be on alert: RedLock's Upa Campbell, vice president of marketing, said it's easier for hackers to try making money by secretly mining cryptocurrencies than stealing and selling corporate data.   ""Cybercriminals will always take the path of least resistance,"" Campbell said.      Hackers don't have to target individual phones or computers -- they can compromise websites and hijack thousands of devices at a time.   Last week, a cryptojacking campaign impacted almost 5,000 websites, including a number of UK and US government pages, through a flaw in a third-party application. Hackers exploited the flaw to mine currency using something called Coinhive.   Coinhive offers legitimate browser-based software tools for businesses to turn their websites' visitors into cryptominers. But some people have taken advantage of the project and now use its software for nefarious purposes. The company launched in September, and websites including Politifact.com and Showtime were unknowingly infected with Coinhive miners last year. Researchers also recently found Coinhive code hidden in Android apps.   Security researcher Scott Helme discovered the massive cryptojacking scheme a few hours after it launched and told CNN it's likely the hackers secretly inserted the malicious code during the weekend, a slow time for government websites, in hopes it stayed there for a long time. Coinhive reportedly said hackers made just 0.1 Monero, or $24, while the attack was active.  Ummm, so yeah, this is *bad*. I just had @phat_hobbit point out that @ICOnews has a cryptominer installed on their site... 😮 pic.twitter.com/xQhspR7A2f    Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive. In fact, some researchers are concerned about its impact on the environment. In both cryptojacking and legitimate mining schemes, people usually prefer to mine Monero, a lesser-known cryptocurrency that does not require as much power to generate.   Not all cryptomining is malicious. For example, digital publishers think it may be a way to make money outside of advertising. Politics and culture publication Salon is currently experimenting with cryptomining, and alerts readers before hijacking their computer's power to generate currency.      ""For the end user, there's not much you can do to protect yourself from cryptojacking beyond using anti-virus software or an ad blocker in your browser,"" Helme said.   If a website is mining currency with your computer, you can close the page to stop the activity. Browser extensions like NoCoin can also be used to block Coinhive and other cryptocurrency miners.   It's possible to analyze how much computing power your browser uses by looking at the Activity Monitor on Macs or the Resource Monitor on Windows computers. These are built-in tools that let you see which applications, like the Chrome or Safari browsers, use the most energy. A graph at the bottom of the monitor will show large spikes in computing power when you visit a website running a cryptominer.   But that might be too complicated. Instead, if you hear your computer's fan start whirring when you're visiting a website, or if the browser suddenly slows down dramatically, a cryptominer may be running.   Although the impact to consumers is low, Helme said it's important to be aware of these attacks and stop them if you can.   ""The bottom line here is your device is being used to make money for a criminal gang,"" he said. ""We don't know who these people are or what their intentions are. They could use it to fuel future criminal activities."" "
175,175,He can afford to pay off his student debt faster. But should he?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/pf/pay-off-student-loans-early/index.html,"Feb 22, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   At the core of Joe's question is a challenge a lot of us face: Where should my next dollar go? There are almost always competing priorities and it can be tricky to know which is the better bet.   Joe is in a pretty solid financial position despite being in debt. The interest rate on his student loan is pretty low and he got a great jump on saving for retirement while making minimum payments on his debt.   If he has money left over after a paycheck, he wants to know if it's better to invest it or use it to pay down his student debt faster.   The short answer is to try to do both.   ""If there's money left over at the end of the month, we generally recommend a split approach,"" said Chuck Cumello, the president of Essex Financial.   But dealing with debt can be emotional, Cumello said. Even if the math shows that investing some of the money makes sense, some people may still want to rid themselves of the debt as soon as possible.   Everyone's situation is different. Here are five questions to ask yourself before deciding to pay down your student debt early.      Make sure you have some cash set aside for emergencies before you start making additional loan payments or investing.   If you find yourself facing unexpected medical bills, a car breakdown, or a leaky roof, this emergency fund will help keep you from taking on even more debt. Experts suggest keeping three to six months of expenses in cash, just in case.   Related: Should I use my savings to pay off credit card debt?      As a young person, time is on your side. Joe is already taking advantage of the power of compounding interest by setting aside 18% of his paycheck for retirement.   If you're not setting aside that much, many experts suggest saving at least 10% of your pay or enough to receive the full match from your company's 401(k) plan if it offers one.   Retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA are good places to start investing because of the tax advantages. But remember, you generally won't be able to access your money before you retire without paying a penalty.      The 2.4% interest rate on Joe's student loan is lower than most.   ""If there is such a thing as good debt, a loan with a 2.4% fixed rate would be good debt,"" Cumello said.   Federal student loans currently charge an interest rate somewhere between 4% and 7%. Other debt is usually more expensive. The average interest rate on credit cards, for example, is around 15%.    If you do have other debts with high interest rates, Cumello suggests paying those down first.   Related: How to survive a career change -- and a pay cut      There is no crystal ball that can tell you how the stock market will perform in the future. That's partly why making the decision to invest is a tough one.   But the move to invest could pay off if your return ends up being greater than the interest you pay on your debt.   Use an online calculator or consult a financial advisor to help you walk through some hypothetical situations. This Student Loan Hero calculator allows you to see how much money you'll save over the long term by paying your student debt off faster.   If Joe puts an additional $100 aside each month toward his student loan, he'll pay off his debt about four years faster and pay about $5,300 less in interest.   If he invests $100 a month and assumes a 6% rate of return, he'll earn about $11,000 and have a total of about $30,000 invested over the same time it takes to pay off his debt, according to this CNNMoney calculator.   Related: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?      Ask yourself what your next big purchases will be. Will you need money for a new car, a wedding, kids or a new home?   Generally, if the expense is coming up within the next two years, Cumello suggests keeping money for that purchase out of the stock market. But if you don't need the money until later on, it could be a good idea to invest.   If you do decide to invest, create a portfolio with stocks and bonds that matches your risk tolerance. Look for low-fee index funds or ETFs that offer exposure to a diversified mix of stocks, he said.   But if you can afford to invest and make additional student loan payments, that's what Cumello says his firm recommends more often than not.   Have a money question for Money Moves?

Canadian government-backed researchers are joining forces with India's vast tech industry to explore the use of blockchain in government and academic institutions, as well as businesses.   India's tech industry association Nasscom and Canada's Blockchain Research Institute (BRI) said they would also create a center of excellence in India to provide ""high-end technology capabilities.""   The announcement coincided with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's visit to India this week.   Blockchain, an internet-based ledger that keeps a public record of online transactions, is being touted as the future of the digital economy for its wide range of potential applications. India plans to use it to digitize everything from land records to healthcare, the head of a government-run think-tank said on Twitter earlier this month.   But blockchain is still best known for providing the platform for virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.   Related: Cryptocurrency regulation is 'inevitable,' says IMF chief   The Indian government has repeatedly warned that virtual currencies have no official backing, even likening them to ""Ponzi schemes"" earlier this year. Experts believe India could be preparing tough regulations, following recent moves in this direction by China and South Korea.   But India is also gung-ho about the underlying technology. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said recently that the country would ""explore use of blockchain technology proactively,"" even as he was denouncing cryptocurrencies in his annual budget speech.   Related: India could be a buzzkill for bitcoin   Canada's BRI, whose stated goal is to ""build blockchain-based economies around the world,"" also touted India as the next big frontier for the technology.   ""We see our coalition with Nasscom as a delightful opportunity to nurture the blockchain community in India,"" Don Tapscott, the institute's founder and executive chairman, said in a statement.   ""We strongly believe that India has the potential to lead the blockchain revolution,"" he added.

177,177,Inside the world of a Kenyan cryptocurrency miner,http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/africa/inside-life-cryptocurrency-miner-kenya-africa/index.html,"Dec 18, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Eugene Mutai is well aware of the risks of mining virtual money. ""Sometimes I ask myself: will the bubble pop?""  He's right to be -- cryptocurrencies are volatile. That hasn't stopped him from operating in this shadowy and controversial corner of the global financial system.  A few years ago Mutai was working odd jobs on farms in rural Kenya. Now he's a cryptocurrency miner in Nairobi. His apartment -- where he mines -- is dimly lit blue and drowned with the low drone of a self-made cryptocurrency computer rig.  Mutai began researching cryptocurrencies last year. ""I was curious about what was making these alternative coins drive."" ""Bitcoin was hard to mine by that point in time,"" Mutai tells CNN. There were already many Bitcoin miners. Instead, Mutai started mining Ethereum, a similar but less well known cryptocurrency.  For Mutai, internet-based currencies are revolutionary. They open up a world of finance that might not have been accessible for a self-taught tech-obsessed kid from Kenya with no college degree.  It's also a nefarious world of online hucksters and frauds. And that's the chance Mutai takes. Is the gamble worth it? What does it mean to mine cryptocurrencies?  Essentially, a cryptocurrency is an encrypted digital coin. Transactions made with these digital coins are added to a growing database known as a blockchain -- and that's where the miners come in.  ""The way I understand what mining cryptocurrencies is, is that it's basically supporting the network and helping the verification and adding of transactions to the whole blockchain database,"" Mutai says.  Put simply, instead of companies like VISA and Mastercard securing transactions miners do.  How then does Mutai make money? ""There's something known as a Hashrate, which is basically how fast can you verify transactions, and eventually help the transactions to be added to the block. ""The more powerful your computer, the more transactions you can verify, the more money you can make. Then for every transaction verification, you get something called a share, which is translated into the cryptocurrency that you're mining,"" Mutai tells CNN.  It can be a lucrative business. Cryptocurrencies have soared in the last year. At the start of 2017, Bitcoin was worth $966. Now it's smashed the $18,000 mark (27/12/17).  Mutai says he makes about $800 each month. Once the mining machine is up and running, aside from the regular power-cuts, he can kick back and let the computer do the work.  However, the huge amounts of electricity needed to run the sort of powerful computers capable of mining can be a hindrance.  ""My electrical cost is probably 20% of my entire earnings, but it's completely nullified by the cryptocurrency doubling in price,"" Mutai says.  Africa's cryptocurrency community  Life for Mutai hasn't always been plain sailing. When he was a teenager he lost both his twin brother and his grandmother around the same time. His mother spiralled into depression and they moved 600km away from Nairobi.  They were tumultuous times. Mutai borrowed his friend's Nokia Symbian S40 mobile phone and taught himself to code on it. Eventually, he moved back to the city to pursue technology further and in 2016 was named Kenya's top developer by Git Awards.   Mutai is part of a growing group of African developers and entrepreneurs engaged in cryptocurrency activities. BitHub, an incubation hub for internet-based currencies, is the center of Nairobi's cryptocurrency scene.  Tech entrepreneur John Karanja founded BitHub in 2015 and runs workshops on blockchain technologies for young developers. They also do training across five African countries.  ""For young people it's an opportunity for them to learn about cryptocurrencies, potentially helping them access global markets,"" Karanja tells CNN.  Digital coins are also attractive for those living in countries with dysfunctional currencies. In Zimbabwe the price of Bitcoin soared to become the most expensive exchange rate worldwide, on the Harare-based trading platform Golix. The skeptics    Cryptocurrencies are riding high, but there are doubters.  Jamie Dimon, Chief executive officer of bank JP Morgan, says Bitcoin is a ""fraud"" and that ""you can't have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air."" There also concerns about the security of cryptocurrencies. Last year $65m worth of Bitcoin was stolen from Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based exchange, resulting in a 20% plunge of its value.  There are no central banks or regulatory authorities that oversee cryptocurrencies.  Mutai is resolute: ""Cryptocurrencies as a concept and the way they work is very revolutionary."" Are cryptocurrencies the future? Mutai is an evangelist for cryptocurrencies. He believes they could one day replace standard currencies.  ""It will be a long battle with governments and financial institutions,"" Mutai says.  Cryptocurrencies could be revolutionary or a swindle. But for now, with Bitcoin worth more than gold, there's a new different kind of -- digital -- miner chasing the treasure.   "

The country's anti-corruption agency said Monday that he was suspected of demanding a bribe of over €100,000 ($124,000).   A lawyer for Rimšēvičs told a local TV station over the weekend that his client believed the detention to be unlawful.   Latvian anti-corruption officials said Monday their case is not related to recent U.S. allegations of fraud at Latvia's third largest bank.   The U.S. Department of the Treasury last week proposed sanctions against Latvia's ABLV Bank, accusing it of having ""institutionalized money laundering as a pillar"" of its business.   ABLV falls under the supervision of the ECB, which effectively shuttered the bank on Monday by suspending its payments and halting withdrawals. The ECB said there had been a sharp deterioration in the lender's financial position.   The Treasury said that ABLV had conducted transactions related to North Korea's procurement or export of ballistic missiles, as well as ""large-scale illicit activity"" connected to Azerbaijan, Russia and Ukraine.   Russia borders Latvia to the east. The Baltic state of two million people is home to about 500,000 ethnic Russians.   ""ABLV has facilitated transactions for corrupt politically exposed persons and has funneled billions of dollars in public corruption and asset stripping proceeds through shell company accounts,"" Treasury official Sigal Mandelker said in a statement on Feb. 13.   ABLV said in a statement on Feb. 14 that the Treasury allegations were based on ""assumptions."" The bank said its employees have never engaged in ""any act of bribery regarding any official.""   The ECB, where Rimšēvičs has served on the rate-setting committee since Latvia adopted the euro at its currency in 2014, declined to comment on his status.   Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis said there were ""no signs of a threat"" to the country's financial system and Latvia's central bank said it would resume normal activities on Monday.   ""All usual services will be provided to businesses and the general public and also to the Latvian economy in general,"" it said in a statement.   Related: North Korea may be making a fortune from bitcoin mania   ABLV said the ECB's decision would give it time to stabilize its situation.   ""The structure of the bank's assets is balanced, yet given the unfolding events currently transfer and sale of assets may require longer time than it is in standard situations,"" ABLV said in a statement.

Investors appear to agree.   The country's benchmark stock index has surged 5% since Zuma stepped down late Wednesday. And the South African rand is trading at its highest level against the U.S. dollar in three years.   ""The optimism and energy in the country is contagious,"" said Byron Lotter, a portfolio manager at Vestact Asset Managers. ""Just a nudge in the right direction is all you need to spur confidence.""   It was a rough ride for Africa's only G20 economy under former President Jacob Zuma, whose nine years in office were marred by a series of scandals that eroded investor confidence.   Under Zuma's watch, the economy sank into recession twice -- in 2009 and 2017 -- falling behind its emerging market peers. Government debt now carries a ""junk"" rating.   Its annual GDP growth has averaged less than 2% since 2009, one of the weakest rates in sub-Saharan Africa. The unemployment rate is sitting around 27%, and inequality is high.   Related: This drone startup helps farmers beat disease and drought   Analysts say that Ramaphosa must move quickly from words to action to restore confidence. Changing the cabinet will be especially important.   Removing ""Zuma's cronies and restoring a more meritocratic approach,"" is a vital first step, said George Glynos, the managing director of ETM Analytics.   Lotter said that selecting a new finance minister will be crucial. He said there are many potential candidates, including Pravin Gordhan, who previously held the post but was ousted by Zuma.   ""There's no lack of expertise,"" Lotter said. ""If any of those guys were put in place as finance minister, it would instil huge confidence in global markets.""   Investors are hoping the incumbent minister -- Malusi Gigaba -- will be replaced before next week's budget.      Another important area: State-owned companies need to be overhauled following a string of corruption scandals and accusations of misused tax dollars.   Eskom, the state power company, and national carrier South African Airways may need to be partially privatized.

182,182,Olympic champion speed skater Ted-Jan Bloemen paid in cryptocurrency,http://www.cnn.com/2018/02/10/sport/crypto-speedskater-ted-jan-bloemen-winter-olympics-intl/index.html,"Feb 10, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)There are almost 3,000 athletes competing at the PyeongChang Olympics, but there is only one who is paid in cryptocurrency.  Canadian Ted-Jan Bloemen, who took gold in the men's 10,000m long-track speed skating, became the first athlete to be paid in virtual money when he struck a one-year sponsorship deal with ONG Social, a social network and crypto community, and CEEK VR, a developer of virtual reality experiences. It's often not easy being a Winter Olympian, particularly in securing financial support to fund the pursuit of sport success, with Bloemen is exploring a ""whole new frontier,"" according to his agent. The double world record-holder set an Olympic record of 12:39.77 at the Gangneung Ice Arena, edging out Dutch rival Jorrit Bergsma. He had claimed silver in the 5,000m a few days previously.  Bloemen is sharing his Olympic journey on the ONG Social network and star in a 360° virtual reality experience on CEEK VR. In return, he will earn cryptocurrency rewards.  ""Speed skating success is all about progression -- building and building to peak at the right time,"" said Bloemen in a joint statement with CEEK VR and ONG Social last month to announce the deal. If it's a deal that provides exposure for ONG and CEEK VR, it could also be a smart move with Mary Spio, who is the CEO and founder of the virtual reality company, pointing out that athletes would increasingly use VR to improve their performance. ""Bloemen's support for cutting-edge technologies is reflective of his proclivity for pushing the boundaries,"" said Spio in a statement. ""We believe Virtual Reality isn't just great for our audience (Ceekers) but will ultimately be used for training and maximizing player performance and potential."" Wild fluctuations Although virtual currencies can fluctuate wildly, Bloemen said he was ""excited"" about his new endorsement, adding he felt like he had got ""two new teammates to help put me over the top, at the most important point in the season."" Bitcoin, the best known cryptocurrency, soared to close to $20,000 last year, before collapsing in December. It was trading at just over $8,573 at the end of the week. According to Kgazette.com, ONG Social has mined 300 million coins, worth a total of $138.69 million. The cryptocurrency was founded in June.  Although it's not known how many coins Bloemen stands to receive, he told Canada's National Post that the deal was ""a minimum amount in cash, but most in cryptocurrencies."" He added: ""For me, the real risk of not getting anything is not there, because I got a little (cash) out of it already. ""And that combination makes this sponsorship really fun, right. Because we're going to help each other. I'm trying to get them a little more exposure to make them succeed, and that would help all of us, right.""

He added: ""This is really a whole new frontier. It will be exciting to see how cryptocurrency can work for Ted-Jan, in particular, but also the impact it will have on the sport marketing industry as a whole."" Although Bloemen was born and raised in the Netherlands, he changed nationality during the 2014-15 season after he failed to make the Dutch speed skating team for the Sochi Olympics.

In November 2015, Bloemen set a new world record in the 10,000 meters, smashing the old record held by his former teammate from the Netherlands, Sven Kramer, by more than five seconds in Salt Lake City.  In December, he broke Kramer's 10-year-old 5,000m world record by 1.5 seconds, once again in Salt Lake City. After that race, he controversially took the label bearing Kramer's name and world record-mark off the wall of the arena and broke it into pieces.  At PyeongChang, the Dutchman finished sixth behind Bloemen in the 10,000m, but had previously bettered him in the 5,000m where Bloemen finished second.  "

184,184,Africa's first bitcoin exchange targets 1 billion users,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/14/technology/bitcoin-luno-billion-users/index.html,"Feb 14, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Luno, founded in South Africa in 2013, has plans to become one of the leading cryptocurrency traders in the world.   CEO and founder Marcus Swanepoel has a goal that would leave many bigger companies in the shade: 1 billion customers by 2025.   ""There are very few industries in the world for which you could say that is a reachable goal, but because bitcoin is so open and global, it is really an achievable goal. We're excited to pursue it,"" he said.   The company is planning to grow its team of 70 employees to 300 over the next six months.   Swanepoel, a former investment banker, say Luno was the first company in Africa to offer cryptocurrency trading.   It has enjoyed runaway growth since then, and now has 1.5 million customers in 40 countries, mostly emerging markets.   Related: What is bitcoin?   The company, backed by some big investors including Naspers, was created by a small group of people with backgrounds in tech and finance who, like Swanepoel wanted to give up their corporate jobs.   The atmosphere in Luno's Cape Town offices is casual -- some of the staff walk around barefoot. But the relaxed approach ends when it comes to protecting Luno against hackers who have made off with bitcoin worth millions from other exchanges.   ""We take security as seriously as big banks do but when we're at the office we're about working together and creating a collaborative environment,"" Swanepoel said.     The firm has developed substantially over the last five years. It began building systems for banks before switching its focus to consumers.   ""We realized the banks were going to take too long to embrace the technology, and they were getting confused about what the technology can do,"" the CEO said.   His team has developed a mobile wallet, exchange and merchant integration services for bitcoin and one of its biggest rivals, ethereum.   Related: Cryptocurrency regulation is inevitable, says IMF chief    Luno is now headquartered in Singapore, partly because of the importance of markets in southeast Asia.   But the company attributes much of its early success to its South African roots and experience in countries like Nigeria where most internet users are mobile.   ""Unlike other companies, because we set up in Africa originally, we built truly mobile-first products,"" Swanepoel said. He believes that has given Luno an edge, particularly over European competitors. "

""It's inevitable,"" she told CNNMoney emerging markets editor John Defterios. ""It's clearly a domain where we need international regulation and proper supervision.""   ""There is probably quite a bit of dark activity [in cryptocurrencies],"" she added at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Sunday.   Lagarde said that the IMF is actively trying to prevent digital currencies from being used to launder money or finance terrorism. But she argued that regulators need to focus less on entities, and more on activities -- who is doing what, and whether they're properly licensed and supervised.   Digital currencies have largely operated in a regulatory vacuum since bitcoin's debut in 2009. But governments and central banks are starting to pay closer attention, warning investors about potential scams.   In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation started to crack down on alleged fraud in fundraising by some cryptocurrency companies and traders.   In Asia, where cryptocurrency is particularly popular, China and South Korea have both cracked down on cryptocurrency trading. Concerns about new restrictions, and rumors over a potential ban in India, have fueled volatility in digital currency prices.   Related: Two bitcoin traders charged with fraud   Top government officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos also signaled that more regulation could be on its way.   ""We encourage fintech, we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure that all of our financial markets are safe and aren't being used for illicit activities,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month at the conference.   British Prime Minister Theresa May echoed that sentiment, saying that her government would look ""very seriously"" at cryptocurrencies ""because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals.""

186,186,China's unwanted bitcoin miners may move to Canada,http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/09/technology/bitcoin-mining-china-canada/index.html,"Feb 9, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   After cracking down last year on exchanges where digital currencies are traded, the Chinese government has recently been moving quietly to evict the country's vast community of bitcoin miners. That's forcing them to look into moving to other countries, with Canada attracting a lot of interest.   Unlike traditional currencies like the dollar, the creation of bitcoin isn't controlled by central banks. Instead, it's ""mined"" by computer algorithms that solve increasingly complex math problems.   People can earn money unearthing cryptocurrencies from the digital deep by running the mining software on computer systems of varying sizes, a process that requires a lot of electricity.   Related: What is bitcoin?   About 60% of all cryptocurrency mining takes place in China, according to a study last year by the University of Cambridge. The country is a good fit for the activity because of the cheap electricity and land available in provincial areas.   But the industry is feeling unwelcome these days.   ""It's a hard time for the mining business in China,"" said Jack Liao, who owns several bitcoin mines in the country.   He said in a recent interview with CNNMoney that he's thinking about moving some of his operations overseas, with Canada, the U.S. and Iceland among the top candidates. Liao is the CEO of cryptocurrency mining firm Lightningasic, which is based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.   Five other owners of bitcoin mines in China also told CNNMoney in the past month that they were considering moving operations out of the country because of pressure from the government. Most declined to be identified by name for this article due to the sensitivity of the situation.   Related: Bitcoin's 'many problems' puzzle regulators   The Chinese government wants cryptocurrency miners to make an ""orderly exit"" from the industry because their operations are bad for the environment, don't pay tax and can be a fire hazard, Liao said, citing reports in Chinese state-run media.   China has shown its willingness to crack down on other aspects of the cryptocurrency industry.   It forced exchanges inside the country to shutter trading operations in September. And it's now reported to be moving to block the websites of overseas trading platforms.   The Chinese government didn't respond to requests from CNNMoney for comment on its stance on bitcoin mining and trading.   Experts say the Chinese government, which imposed controls in recent years aimed at stopping too much money from flowing out of the country, is wary of how cryptocurrencies can enable people to move funds outside of the traditional financial system and potentially put them to nefarious uses.   Efforts by governments around the world to take an increasingly hard line on cryptocurrencies have contributed to the recent sharp decline in their prices. After getting close to $20,000 in late 2017, bitcoin tumbled below $6,000 this week.  This is a modal window.     For the people running bitcoin mines in China, the big question at the moment is figuring out where to go.   Running a bitcoin mine has a very specific list of requirements. The energy needs are huge for one thing. Digital currency website Digiconomist last year reported that one bitcoin mine it visited in Inner Mongolia used the same amount of power that's needed to continuously fly a Boeing 747.   ""You need a country that can provide such a big capacity at a reasonable price,"" Liao said.   Miners also want a government that's going to take a hands-off approach to regulating cryptocurrencies.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned   Canada ticks a lot of boxes. The country has cheap, reliable energy sources, as well as a chilly climate. The latter helps servers keep cool to prevent them overheating.   Interest from Chinese bitcoin miners is already being noticed in the country.   Hydro Quebec, a big electricity supplier in eastern Canada, is receiving ""new requests every day"" for its services from bitcoin mining firms, said spokesman Marc-Antoine Pouliot.   He added that the majority of these requests were coming from China and that demand had ""risen significantly"" since the end of last summer, when Chinese authorities stepped up their crackdown on bitcoin exchanges.   Hydro Quebec has about 30 projects from bitcoin miners in its pipeline, Pouliot said.   Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment    Hydro Manitoba, a power provider in central Canada, said it had also been approached by a number of North American brokers representing Chinese bitcoin miners in recent months.   Among their requirements was the reassurance that their mammoth energy demands could be met and that they could get operations up and running quickly, said Bruce Owen, a Hydro Manitoba spokesman. Unlike more everyday business ventures, bitcoin mining gobbles up energy all day and all night.   ""There is little time variation in their electric requirements -- it is nearly constant 24/7,"" Owen said.   Related: It's getting harder to buy bitcoin with a credit card   Other Canadian companies also see potential business opportunities from bitcoin miners' interest in the country.   Resolute Forest Products is one of Canada's biggest manufacturers of tissues and paper products. The company, based in Montreal, has ""received multiple calls"" from bitcoin miners who want to use spare space in its factories, said spokesman Seth Kursman.   The company is still in the process of figuring out what kind of services it can provide, he said.   Uprooting an entire bitcoin mine is no easy feat, however.   Liao said it can take months to find a new location, buy computer equipment and hire new staff to help you run the facility.   The costs can be eye-watering, too. He claimed they can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on the size of the operations.   Liao and other mine owners will have to make their big decisions on where to go while watching bitcoin's volatile price rising and falling by thousands of dollars on an almost daily basis.   -- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.

In this week's (barely) profitable moment, a reality check for investors has come like a slap in the face to Wall Street.   On the surface, the sell-off isn't one for the history books. A Black Monday it is not. Normally, when the Dow drops by 2.5% to 3%, it doesn't ruffle the feathers of the hardened traders I've come to know down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.    My daily routine for ""Quest Express"" has me spending hours on the floor with the traders and market makers at the NYSE. They've been at this a long time, and even they say this week's volatility is like nothing they've ever seen.    Investors have seemed to rush to the exit one minute, and run back into the market the next.    On Monday, the swing on the Dow was more than 1,600 points.    The Dow went on a roller coaster ride Tuesday, oscillating between a gain and a loss 28 times throughout the session. The Dow fell another 1,000 points Thursday.   Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox   Why? Well, that's anyone's guess. It could be the computer algorithms and high-frequency trading. Or maybe it's the fear of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and its new chair (only a week into the job). Some are blaming the latest Wall Street financial product that no one seems to understand.   Regardless of the cause, the simple fact is that the party is over. Say farewell to interest rates near zero, not just in the United States, but in the U.K., in Europe and maybe even Japan!    It was fun while it lasted. Now the lights have come on and the punch bowl has been removed. Yes, some may have quite a financial hangover to contend with, but Financial Armageddon this is not.      Fasten your seat belts. The stock market has gone from boring to bananas -- in the span of just two weeks. After months of unusual calm, fears about inflation and soaring bond rates have taken over Wall Street. After dropping by a spooky 666 points on Friday, the Dow plunged by a record 1,175 points on Monday. An attempted rebound was thwarted as stocks tumbled again on Thursday. The good news is the market turmoil doesn't mean the economy is in trouble. Growth still looks strong. A sell-off was long overdue. Extreme optimism about booming stocks made a tumble nearly inevitable. And here it is.    -- Matt Egan        Will the Federal Reserve have to raise rates faster this year? Investors seem to think so. Jitters over higher inflation and the Fed helped send stocks plunging this week. It'll now be up to Jerome Powell, the new Fed chairman, to carefully guide those rate hikes without sparking a U.S. recession.   -- Donna Borak        Americans are skipping out on the Winter Olympics this year. Flight bookings from the United States to South Korea in February were up 24% compared with the previous year, according to data from travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys. That figure would normally be in the triple digits for such a big event, said a ForwardKeys spokesman. Blame the lack of interest on high travel costs, a shortage of hotel rooms and a remote location: PyeongChang, where the games take place, is a two-hour train ride from the South Korean capital, Seoul. And rising tensions with North Korea don't help.   -- Danielle Wiener-Bronner      A large chunk of labor union IG Metall's 2.3 million members are getting more flexible working hours and a big pay raise. Workers at many of Germany's top engineering firms -- including Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler (DDAIF) -- can now choose to work 28 hours a week for up to two years before returning to the standard 35-hour week. IG Metall said it will help employees with children and older relatives. It is expected to have ripple effects across German industry.

A day later, the index briefly entered what's known as a correction -- a 10% decline from its recent peak.   Here's what's going on and what it means for your wallet:   WHY THE DOW IS PLUNGING   The Dow fell 800 points in 10 minutes on Monday.   CNNMoney's David Goldman explains why the index is going crazy:   1. Concerns the Fed will raise rates: If the economy gets much stronger, inflation could take off. That could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than planned.   2. Rising interest rates: When interest rates rise sharply, stocks often fall.   3. Worries about the bond market: Investors have been nervously watching the bond market, where yields have been creeping higher. As yields rise, bonds offer better returns, which makes them more attractive to investors compared with risky stocks.   4. Too far, too fast: Stocks have been rising pretty much in a straight line since November 2016, and that's not exactly healthy.   The tremors on Wall Street spread around the globe. Stocks in Europe and Asia posted heavy losses. Bitcoin briefly fell below $6,000 for the first time in three months before recovering most of its earlier losses.   DON'T PANIC (YET)   Many experts say this week's slump isn't cause for bigger concerns, reports CNNMoney's Daniel Shane.   The global economy is in good shape and there is no talk of recession among economists.   In the U.S., unemployment is at a 17-year low. Last month, average hourly wages went up the most in eight years. Consumer and business confidence are near record levels.   And given Wall Street's performance last year, the drop was expected.   WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU   What should the average investor do now? Probably nothing.   A 1,000-plus point drop sounds scary, but it's actually a smaller percentage of the market than previous one-day drops, thanks to Wall Street's recent run up.   A few tips to stay calm and carry on, according to CNNMoney's Kathryn Vasel:   1. Remain calm: Yes, that's easier said than done. But it's important to keep your eye on the big picture.   2. Play the long game: What are your investing objectives? If they're long term, you're probably fine. But worried investors could take the time to review their portfolios to make sure their exposure to stocks aligns with their goals, time frame and risk tolerance.   3. Don't try to time the market: While experts said it's not a good idea to panic and sell now, Monday's drop could present a buying opportunity for those with more money to invest.   READY FOR PAY DAY?   Now some good news: your paycheck might get a little fatter this month thanks to the new tax law.   But the pay bump might not be very much.   Any increase that you see in your take-home pay will depend on a lot of factors beyond your salary and how many allowances you take. And those other factors could undercut any increase in pay that you would otherwise see from the federal tax cuts, reports CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi. "

""There are many problems"" with the way bitcoin markets operate, testified Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on cryptocurrency oversight Tuesday.   Clayton and Chris Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, testified that tighter regulation and a more coordinated response between federal agencies were needed to protect investors from fraud and abuse in digital currency markets.   Securities and commodities laws protecting investors don't neatly apply to new online currency trading. Regulators have trouble enforcing the laws, because it's not entirely clear what bitcoin is or does. Is bitcoin a currency? A security? Something entirely different?   ""What's so challenging about bitcoin is that it has characteristics of multiple different things,"" Giancarlo said.   Although Clayton said it was too soon to know whether Congress needed to enact laws targeting cryptocurrencies, he said, ""We may be back with our friends from Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation.""   Clayton said investors raising money through initial coin offerings are similar to investors buying stocks. That makes bitcoin like a security, and it falls under SEC enforcement.   Related: Bitcoin was $800 a year ago. Now it's $17,000   Bitcoin's price skyrocketed in 2017 to above $19,000 on mostly unregulated trading platforms.

Two weeks ago, hackers stole $530 million from a Japanese currency exchange.   ""We must crack down hard on those who try to abuse [investors'] enthusiasm with fraud and manipulation,"" Giancarlo said.   Bitcoin tumbled as much as 13% during the day to below $6,000 for the first time in three months.   It clawed back losses during morning trading and was back up above $7,00. Bitcoin has lost close to two-thirds of its value since it peaked above $19,000 in December.   Related: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tank   Cryptocurrency investors have been alarmed by sharpened rhetoric around online currencies in recent weeks.   In Tuesday, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens called bitcoin a ""combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.""   Carstens' comments followed scrutiny Monday from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI started to crack down on alleged fraud in fundraising by some cryptocurrency companies and traders.   Digital currency had been operating in a regulatory vacuum since bitcoin's debut in 2009. But regulators started paying closer attention and warned investors about potential scams. The SEC created a Cyber Unit to go after suspected fraudsters.

""The recent spate of bad news continues for cryptocurrencies, with several important banks announcing a ban on the purchase of cryptocurrencies with credit cards,"" he said.   In Asia, where cryptocurrency is particularly popular, China and South Korea have both cracked down on cryptocurrency trading.   Concerns about new restrictions, and rumors over a potential ban in India, have fueled volatility in crypto prices.   Related: Dow drops more than 1,000 points   Bitcoin is the best known of virtual currencies and experienced a wild run-up in value last year to nearly $20,000 before plunging in December.   Hileman said the dramatic increase last year could also be contributing to the pullback in other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, which didn't experience the same level of volatility prior to the current comedown.

Unocoin said it had not faced any banking challenges, while Zebpay and Coinsecure did not respond to requests for comment.

Long Blockchain (LBCC), which used to be known as Long Island Iced Tea before it went all-in on cryptocurrencies, soared nearly 200% the day that it announced its new business model. But shares have plunged nearly 55% since then.   And it appears that the company is having a tough time making the transition from a maker of bottles of non-alcoholic Long Island Iced Tea (uhh, what's the point?) to blockchain powerhouse.   Long Blockchain said Friday it was abandoning a previously announced plan to buy bitcoin mining equipment and would focus instead on a merger with the UK-based firm Stater Blockchain.   But the decision to not go ahead with the purchase of the bitcoin mining rigs is a bit curious. After all, Long Blockchain said when it announced the Stater deal just a few weeks ago that the merger would ""complement"" its acquisition of the bitcoin equipment.   Shares of Long Blockchain actually rose a bit Friday, but it's worth noting that trading volume was extremely light. And the overarching trend for the stock over the past few weeks is still down.   Bitcoin prices have tumbled after nearly hitting $20,000 in December. The price briefly fell below $8,000 Friday due to fears of more regulation worldwide. Ethereum, litecoin, ripple, cardano and numerous other cryptocurrencies have plunged as well.   Related: Forget bitcoin.

None of this is good news for Long Blockchain, or other companies that decided to hitch their wagons to the cryptocraze, only to watch their stock prices plunge along with bitcoin and other digital currencies this year.   A company now called Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has plunged nearly 60% so far in 2018. Last year, the company changed its name from Bioptix and changed its business model from biotech to bitcoin.   LongFin (LFIN), a financial tech firm that recently went public, and initially skyrocketed after announcing that it bought a blockchain microlender, has lost more than a third of its value this year.   And shares of a small company called Nodechain (VPTK) have dropped by more than 40% this year as well. Nodechain recently got into the cryptocurrency mining business last December.

The South Korean company said it's ramping up production of computer chips used to mine digital currencies like bitcoin, cashing in on growing demand.   Samsung (SSNLF) mentioned in its latest financial report this week that rising sales of these chips are expected to help its earnings this year.   People ""mine"" bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by using computers to solve complex math puzzles. Those computers increasingly require more efficient chips to power them.   Experts have raised concerns about the environmental impact of the huge energy demands from bitcoin mining, much of which is located in China.   Related: Samsung is flying high. Here's what could bring it down to earth   The spike in prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past year has driven up interest in mining them.

The company already has a mobile wallet service called Line Pay, which lets users pay for goods and services using money stored in their account.   Line said Wednesday that it will also start selling other financial services, such as insurance and personal loans.   Investors were upbeat about the news. Line's stock rose gained 2.6% in Tokyo on Wednesday.   Related: So, why shouldn't I buy bitcoin?

Japan has emerged as a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity. About a third of all trading in bitcoin at any one time takes place in Japanese yen, according to data from industry website CryptoCompare.

One big change for those who report business income on their individual tax returns: a 20% deduction on business income for owners, partners and shareholders in so-called pass-thorugh entities.   But there are still many unanswered questions about who qualifies and what portion of their income the deduction applies to. Here are five basic questions anyone with pass-through income should consider.   Another big change is that 529 savings accounts can now be used for both college and private K-12 expenses. But not every state law automatically complies with the new rule. About 20 states must change the state code before K-12 withdrawals are exempt from state taxes.   Experts suggest taxpayers check with their state before making a K-12 withdrawal.   IS A TRAVEL REWARD CARD WORTH IT?

If confirmed, it's expected to rank as the biggest such theft on record, eclipsing the estimated $400 million in bitcoin stolen from Mt Gox in 2014.   Coincheck said the hackers stole customer deposits of NEM, a less well known digital currency.   The exchange promised to use cash from its own funds to pay out ¥46.3 billion ($426 million) toward covering its users' losses. That's about 20% less than the total value of the virtual tokens that were stolen.   Related: What is bitcoin?

Coincheck didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on how exactly it will fund the customer refunds.     A Japanese government spokesman said Monday that Coincheck would be asked to improve its business practices following the hack. Financial authorities are supervising the company's response to the theft, he said.   The Coincheck hack is the latest in a series of attacks targeting digital currency exchanges. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage of security weaknesses at young, often unregulated businesses that are handling huge sums of other people's money.

Mt Gox went bankrupt shortly afterward and affected users still haven't been compensated.   The meteoric rise in the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past year or so appears to have intensified interest from thieves.   Last month, South Korean bitcoin exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy after being targeted by cybercriminals twice in the space of a few months.   In a separate incident last month, hackers made off with more than $70 million worth of bitcoin from NiceHash, a digital currency trading platform based in Slovenia.   Many exchanges have grown very quickly as trading has taken off but haven't focused on improving cybersecurity, Arslanian said.

""The central banks have been nurturing the [financial] system for centuries... we've got a good thing going on,"" Nobel laureate Robert Shiller said at a debate about the cryptocurrency.   Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of Sweden's central bank, said she had ""no problem with people using [bitcoin] as an asset to invest in.""   ""But it's too volatile to be used as currency,"" she added.

Bitcoin is not new to Bhatt and Robinhood co-founder and co-CEO Vlad Tenev, though.

That's compared with just 3% of those aged 45-54 and 55-64. Men were more interested than women in putting their money in crypto, with 14% of Millennial men saying they would opt for that over any other investment, compared with 9% of women.

You're certainly not the only person with a major fear of missing out on cryptocurrency.   The buzz is real. The prices of bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin, are skyrocketing. Kodak (KODK) is planning to launch a ""photo-centric cyrptocurrency."" You can now trade bitcoin futures, buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on blockchain technology, and even invest a self-directed IRA in a variety of cryptocurrencies.   (Blockchain, if you don't know, is the technology behind bitcoin that records all transactions made with cryptocurrencies.)   If you bought $1,000 of bitcoin three years ago, it would be worth about $39,000 today. That would have been nice.   ""But that's a scary way to think about your investments,"" said Adam Grealish, senior quantitative researcher at Betterment.   Related Bitcoin bounces back   It's much more important to think about how the investment will do in the future, rather than how it did in the past, he said. And it's more difficult to put a value on bitcoin's future than that of a more conventional investment.   So, is it worth it to dip your toes into bitcoin? It certainly depends on your financial situation. But here are three reasons why it's generally not a good idea.      Your chances of seeing a big payout from buying bitcoin ""is almost lottery ticket-like,"" said Grealish.   You could also think of buying bitcoin the same way an angel investor thinks about investing in a start-up, he said. They hope it will be successful, but there are a ton of unknowns. Most of the time angel investors expect to lose money, but the payout is big if one actually performs as promised.   ""You have to be OK with losing everything,"" he said.   Related: I'm 23. How do I start investing?      Bitcoin is a currency, not a company. So there are no cash flows to analyze or financial reports to review when deciding to invest. That's one of the reasons it's more risky than buying a company's stock.   Those who believe in its value are betting that it will become widely adopted as a new way money is exchanged, Grealish said.   It's hard to know if that will happen. While several companies are trying to attach themselves to the bitcoin surge, the future doesn't look completely rosy. Wall Street banks have warned that trading bitcoin futures could be dangerous. And Stripe, an early advocate for bitcoin, will stop processing transactions in April because of its wild volatility.   Even if cryptocurrencies prove valuable, there's a chance bitcoin won't survive and another coin will -- and you could have picked the wrong one.   ""This is a very nascent field pushed up by speculation. We urge an incredible amount of caution,"" Grealish said.      So you've heard the warnings. But you still want to put a little play money into bitcoin.   Northwestern Mutual CFP Chantel Bonneau says that for many people, the money could be invested or saved in a better place. That could be an emergency savings fund, maxing out a 401(k) to receive your full company match, or taking advantage of the tax benefits offered by an IRA.   Related: Robinhood trading app introduces cryptocurrency   ""So unless you have infinite dollars, you're giving up some to a very risky, speculative investment, that could be allocated to another financial position,"" Bonneau said.   Even if your finances are in perfect shape, remember that you'll be in for a wild ride. It can be mentally stressful to deal with all the volatility we've seen from bitcoin.   ""Just because something is not that exciting doesn't mean it's not a great approach,"" Bonneau said. "

The price is back above $11,000, just a day after it briefly dipped below $10,000. And millennials could be the reason for the rebound.   It's been a wild ride for bitcoin over the past year. The price surged more than 1,400% in 2017, topping out at nearly $20,000. But that led to worries that bitcoin may be a bubble and that investors are ignoring many risks.   Bitcoin has plunged nearly 20% this year because of concerns about a possible crackdown by South Korea and China and because of a warning from the SEC about its extreme volatility.   The big price fluctuations have also led Stripe, a digital payments company, to announce that it will soon stop processing bitcoin transactions.   Related: What is bitcoin?   A Stripe executive said in a blog post that bitcoin is now ""better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange"" -- a concern many analysts share. Currencies like the dollar, euro and yen don't move as wildly as bitcoin does. They are much more stable.   And UBS chairman Axel Weber told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the Swiss investment bank won't trade bitcoin because he is concerned that more regulations could cause a ""massive"" drop in the price.   That's a lot of bitcoin doom and gloom. So why has the price bounced back this quickly? Tim Hockey, the CEO of discount brokerage firm TD Ameritrade (AMTD), has an interesting theory.   Hockey said during the company's earnings conference call Tuesday that there has been increased interest in ""blockchain related securities, as well as cryptocurrencies in general"" from its average investors, many of which are now younger millennials. Blockchain is the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   ""Bitcoin and blockchain-related stocks have been more frequently among our clients' top traded stocks since November,"" he said. (Hockey said cannabis stocks were growing increasingly popular with traders as well.)   Related: Forget bitcoin -- here come the blockchain ETFs   Others think bitcoin will continue to rebound -- and even hit new highs. Dan Ciotoli, a software engineer and blockchain analyst with the research firm Bespoke Investment Group, told CNBC on Wednesday that the price of bitcoin could soar to $30,000 by year's end.   His rationale? Transactions for purchases involving bitcoin should continue to get faster and cheaper. So bitcoin will become a more viable form of payment, not just a hot momentum trade for what he called ""get-rich-quick investors.""   Still, bitcoin could be supplanted by other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and ripple if the processing kinks aren't worked out soon.   ""There are signs that perhaps bitcoin is the victim of its own success,"" Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance with Warwick Business School in Britain, said in an email.   ""Rising fees and longer transaction times are the natural consequence of the widespread increasing demand following the public hype and excitement surrounding it,"" Bianchi added. ""This is bad news for the use of Bitcoin as a pure method of payment.""   But he also said he doesn't believe there will be ""epic crash"" in the entire crypto world.   ""The truth is that the increasing costs and processing times will spur interest in alternative coins and developments, rather than killing the aggregate demand,"" Bianchi said.   And that seems to be the consensus view of most on Wall Street -- even bitcoin bears. Few would deny the growth potential for digital payments and blockchain technology broadly. But bitcoin may not necessarily be the crypto that wins out in the end. "
206,206,Major payments firm to stop accepting bitcoin,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/24/technology/stripe-ends-bitcoin-payments/index.html,"Jan 24, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Leading online payments company Stripe said it will stop processing bitcoin transactions in April.   Stripe, which works with more than 100,000 businesses around the world, said it made the decision because huge volatility in bitcoin's price has made it pretty impractical for making and receiving payments.   ""Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange,"" Stripe executive Tom Karlo wrote in a company blog post Tuesday.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Stripe's withdrawal of support comes on the back of bitcoin's wild ride over the last year or so.   Over the course of 2017, its price surged from under $1,000 to more than $19,000 at one point. It's plunged back to around $10,000 during tumultuous trading this month.   Experts say that the violent swings make bitcoin less useful as a currency and more of a vehicle for speculators to bet on its future value.   Stripe was one of the first payments companies to throw its weight behind bitcoin, introducing transactions in the virtual currency in early 2015.   But since then, transaction fees for processing bitcoin payments have risen, Stripe said. That has made the currency less and less popular with businesses that use Stripe.   Related: Bitcoin mania: What the big finance names are saying   The company said it would stop processing all bitcoin transactions on April 23.   Gaming company Steam stopped accepting bitcoin payments for similar reasons in December.   However, Stripe said it couldn't rule out adopting bitcoin again at some point in the future. It added that it was also looking into using other virtual currencies, such as ethereum and lightning. "
207,207,Infant Social Security numbers are for sale on the dark web,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/22/technology/infant-data-dark-web-identity-theft/index.html,"Jan 22, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The personal details of children -- including dates of birth and mother's maiden names -- have been sought after for years. Now, researchers have found an ad on a forum for the sale of data claiming to be from infants.   The cost: $300 worth of bitcoin for each baby's data set.   An infant's personal information can provide cybercriminals access to a clean credit history. This can be used to take out mortgages, apply for credit cards or receive government benefits.   Because child identity theft schemes can go undetected for years, often until they're old enough to open up a credit card account, their data is considered especially valuable.   The ad read ""get em befor tax seson [sic]"" -- a nod to the busiest time of year for identity theft.   Related: Cybercriminals can take a class on stealing credit cards   It was posted on a dark web marketplace only accessible through software called Tor. The dark web refers to networks of websites that require specific software to access. Some dark web sites are known for criminal activity.   On some dark web forums, cybercriminals can take classes on how to steal credit card data. Members of these forums also sell ""fullz,"" a slang term for full sets of people's personal information.   The listing for infant data was discovered by researchers at Terbium Labs, a dark web intelligence firm. The cost and age of the alleged victims came as a surprise to Emily Wilson, the company's director of analysis.   Although the firm has seen child data for sale before, this was the first time it has seen infants' data for sale.   ""It's unusual to have information specifically marked as belonging to children or to infants on these markets,"" Wilson said.    The interest is not surprising. According to a 2011 report from Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab, the rate of child identity theft is 51 times higher than for adults (whose data sets cost about $10 - $25 on dark web markets).   Related: Identity thieves used stolen data 9 minutes after it was posted online   Identity theft can have a lingering effect on a child's financial history.   Christina Warren -- a former reporter who now works for a large tech company -- was about 12-years-old when she started receiving credit card bills. After collection notices piled up, her parents had to convince creditors her identity had been stolen.   Credit reporting agencies said they fixed the issue, but she later had trouble getting her first credit card.   ""It was a massive headache,"" Warren told CNN Tech. ""I didn't realize until six years later that it was still ongoing.""   Even now, Warren, 35, doesn't know how her identity was stolen. Before the internet became a playground for hackers, low-tech methods included mail theft, burglary, phone scams or taking advantage of lost or stolen wallets, said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.   Now, it's easier than ever for criminals to steal personal data, thanks largely to the growth of sophisticated phishing attempts, major data breaches and more credit card applications and taxes filed online. In 2017, the Equifax breach alone exposed Social Security numbers and other personal information of more than 145 million people.   Lisa Schifferle, an attorney with the FTC's Division of Consumer and Business Education, said Social Security numbers are the main component of child identity theft.   ""It [doesn't always have to be in] in the child's name,"" Schifferle said. ""Sometimes thieves use Social Security numbers in connection with a made-up name or their own name.""   When personal data is dumped online, it takes only a few minutes before people try to exploit it, according to a FTC report conducted last year.   The FTC currently provides resources for parents who think a child's identity may have been stolen, and tips for keeping their information safe, starting from the time he or she is a baby.    Velasquez said parents should keep an eye out for signs that their child's information has been stolen. This may include receiving an alert when a Social Security number has credit history when you file your taxes or if a child is receiving a jury summons.   After numerous phone calls and verifying documentation, Warren and her parents eventually straightened out the issue.   ""[One thing I learned is to] keep documentation and paperwork for everything,"" said Warren, noting identity theft victims may be asked to prove the situation was sorted. "
209,209,Two bitcoin traders charged with fraud,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/19/technology/cftc-feds-bitcoin-fraud/index.html,"Jan 19, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed civil charges against two alleged cryptocurrency fraudsters, one in New York and the other in Colorado. These are not criminal charges; they are lawsuits filed in federal court in New York seeking restitution for victims as well as financial penalties and trading bans.   The alleged schemes started in April 2017. That was shortly before bitcoin began its stratospheric rise in value from slightly more than $1,000 to a peak of $19,343 on December. 16, according to Coindesk.com. The rise of bitcoin created a frenzy among investors who wanted to get in on virtual currency.   ""Increased public interest in bitcoin and other virtual currencies has provided new opportunities for bad actors,"" James McDonald, enforcement director for the CFTC, said in a statement.   The federal agency accuses a New York bitcoin trader, Patrick K. McDonnell of Staten Island, of taking money to conduct trades and impart market tips. He is accused of absconding with the funds instead.   The CFTC charged McDonnell and his company, known variously as CabbageTech and Coin Drop Markets, with fraud and misappropriation in their trading of bitcoin and litecoin, which also experienced a meteoric runup last year.   CNNMoney was unable to contact McDonnell. The CFTC said McDonnell and his company convinced customers to give them money and also virtual currency in exchange for conducting trades and providing crypto-market tips. But the CFTC complaint says that McDonnell and his company just took the bitcoin without providing anything in return, wiping clean their Internet and social media presence ""in an attempt to conceal the scheme.""   Related: Litecoin, not just bitcoin, had a crazy spike last year   CFTC enforcement director McDonald said that McDonnell and his company ""preyed on customers interested in bitcoin and litecoin, promising them the opportunity to get the inside scoop on the next new thing and to benefit from the trading acumen of a supposed expert."" They allegedly promised a 300% return on investment within one week.   The CFTC also accuses a Colorado man, Dillon Michael Dean of Longmont near Boulder, and his British-registered company The Entrepreneurs Headquarters Limited, of fraudulently soliciting bitcoin from customers which it put into a pool described as investment funds, but which was allegedly a ""Ponzi scheme.""   The CFTC says that starting in April 2017, Dean allegedly solicited more than $1 million in bitcoin from more than 600 people, promising to use their virtual funds as ""an investment vehicle for trading commodity interests."" But the CFTC says he ""misappropriated"" the funds, using them to pay other customers ""in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.""   CNNMoney was unable to contact Dean. A spokeswoman for the CFTC said it doesn't have attorneys listed for either defendant.   Related: Feds ramp up focus on ICOs    The feds ramped up their interest in cryptocurrencies late last year. The Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors to be on the lookout for ""potential scams"" involving Initial Coin Offerings, a form of raising funds that sometimes involved cryptocurrencies while avoiding the regulatory scrutiny of other forms of corporate fundraising.   The SEC also created its new Cyber Unit to seek out ""pump and dump"" schemes involving ICOs and cryptocurrencies. In December the SEC froze the assets against PlexCorps, a company running an ICO for its own cryptocurrency, and filed charges against the Canadians who were allegedly running it. Their lawyer said they would fight the charges.   In November the Federal Bureau of Investigation charged a Brooklyn businessman with fraud for allegedly bilking investors through a real estate ICO scam called REcoin. He pleaded not guilty. "
210,210,Forget bitcoin. Here come the blockchain ETFs.,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/19/investing/new-blockchain-etfs-bitcoin/index.html,"Jan 19, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   So it should come as no surprise that there are now two exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, focused on blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.   The Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) and Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETFs both launched this week. ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks, and these two each own shares of the increasing number of companies that use blockchain.   But note that the words bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain are not in the names of these funds.   That's intentional, according to the CEOs of Reality Shares and Amplify ETFs.   Both told CNNMoney that the SEC was worried because some stocks have skyrocketed lately simply because they said that they were using blockchain technology.   Riot Blockchain (RIOT) used to be a biotech firm. Long Blockchain (LBCC) is the company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Co. And Kodak (KODK) just launched its own KodakCoin cryptocurrency.   ""Investors have been buying blindly, and there has been some abuse,"" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs. ""The SEC has to protect investors.""   But make no mistake. These two funds are set up to take advantage of the growing interest in blockchain.   This is not the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a fund that only owns bitcoin and is run by Cameron and Tyler, of Facebook and ""The Social Network"" movie fame. The Winklevii want to launch an ETF with the ticker symbol COIN, but the SEC has yet to approve it.   In fact, the SEC seems unlikely to greenlight any funds that just want to invest in cryptocurrencies. Dalia Blass, director of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, wrote in a letter Thursday that it had many questions about these funds.   And she said that until they are addressed, ""we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products.""   Related: Jamie Dimon regrets calling bitcoin a 'fraud'   That edict does not apply to the new blockchain funds, though. Those ETFs don't own any bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, ripple or any of the other numerous cyrptocurrencies out there. Instead, they are buying shares of companies that are embracing blockchain.   Both funds own Overstock (OSTK), the online retailer, which has made a big push into blockchain through its Medici Ventures unit and tZero digital coin exchange.   They also own IBM (IBM), which recently partnered with shipping giant Maersk to track and manage supply chains using blockchain technology. Intel (INTC), whose chips and software are used to encrypt cryptocurrency transactions, is a top holding in both ETFs, too.   Each is betting on financial firms that could benefit from blockchain. The Reality Shares fund owns shares of Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Barclays (BCS) for example while the Amplify fund has stakes in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS).   But there are some key differences between the two ETFs. Reality Shares is based on an index of blockchain-related companies that it recently launched with Nasdaq. That index -- and hence, the fund's holdings -- are rebalanced twice a year.   The Amplify ETF, on the other hand, is actively managed and free to make changes to its holdings more frequently.   Related: Why everyone is talking about Ripple   Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares, said his firm's ETF is taking a rigorous look at just how much exposure to the blockchain business a company has before adding it to the index and fund.   ""We're not going to accept Kodak just because it's suddenly decided to do something with blockchain,"" Ervin said.   He said the company also doesn't own MoneyGram (MGI) in the fund, despite a recent partnership with Ripple, or Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), which is letting people buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app.   But Amplify's Magoon said his fund has bought a small stake in Kodak. And Square is a top-10 position in the fund. Still, he's wary of smaller companies trying to ride the blockchain and bitcoin wave. ""We don't want scam stocks,"" he said.   So far, each of the ETFs is up a bit in its first few days of trading. But neither has exploded like bitcoin often has.   And Magoon said that's just fine with him.   ""Bitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn't need bitcoin,"" he said. ""The crash in cryptocurrencies is good and healthy."" "

The price of the volatile digital currency briefly dipped below $10,000 around 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday, its lowest level since late November, according to data from CoinDesk.com.   Bitcoin has dropped nearly 30% this week and has lost almost half of its $19,343 peak value on December 16. Bitcoin approached its record as it launched on futures exchanges in the United States. But it has since fallen sharply.   Other popular cryptocurrencies ethereum and ripple also have posted double-digit losses. One virtual currency exchange, Bitconnect, dived 93% late Monday.   It's unclear why bitcoin has had a rough week. Cryptocurrency is a murky market with frequent swings.

Previous reports from cybersecurity firms and South Korean government officials said North Korean hackers had targeted cryptocurrency exchanges in the summer of 2017.

The university is a high-profile institution where scions of the North Korean elite study.   North Korea may be making a fortune from bitcoin mania   The revelations of the latest attacks on South Korean investors come as the country's government is considering whether to clamp down on cryptocurrency trading within its borders.   If the South Korean government tightens regulations and exchanges in the country step up security, North Korean hackers may ""look to exchanges and users in other countries,"" the Recorded Future researchers said.

217,217,Venezuela president offers pregnant women $3.83 a month,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/15/news/economy/venezuela-maduro-pregnant-women/index.html,"Jan 16, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Emphasis on ""a little.""   Maduro announced during his annual address to the nation that pregnant women would receive a payment of 700,000 bolivars a month. It sounds like a lot, but Venezuela's runaway inflation means that sum is worth just $3.83 at the current exchange rate that millions of citizens follow closely.   Once the child is born, mothers will receive an additional 1 million bolivars, or $5.48.   Maduro didn't give a specific reason for the new handouts. Despite the fact that the sums aren't worth much in reality, he received a standing ovation from his supporters after announcing them.   Amid the country's collapsing economy, Venezuelans suffer from extreme shortages of medicine, food, toiletries and other essential items. The payments for pregnant women are unlikely to help them get hold of those things.   And the paltry sums will almost certainly be worth less in a matter of days as Venezuela's hyperinflation devours people's paychecks and salaries.   One dollar currently equals about 182,000 bolivars, according to a widely followed unofficial exchange rate. That's up from just over 41,000 bolivars in November.   The vast majority of citizens don't follow the government's official rate because it's believed to overvalue the bolivar.   Related: Venezuela's oil production plummets    Inflation in Venezuela last year rose above 4,000%, according to Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on hyperinflation.   The new handouts for pregnant women highlight Maduro's enthusiasm for announcing plans to dish out the country's rapidly devaluing cash.   He has raised Venezuela's monthly minimum wage several times in recent years. In November, he gave out a ""Christmas voucher"" worth 500,000 bolivars (roughly $12 at the time, but about $2.74 now) to 4 million families.   Maduro has also tried to control prices in the economy. Earlier this month, he ordered private supermarkets, which set their own prices on most items, to slash food prices, causing confusion among customers.   Related: Venezuela plans its own version of Bitcoin    The president often claims he's trying to aid Venezuelans as the United States and other nations wage what he calls an ""economic war"" against his regime. Independent economists say government mismanagement, unsustainable policies and widespread corruption have crippled the nation of 30 million people.   One key rub to the payment for pregnant mothers is that they must have Venezuela's new national ID card. It's seen in the country as a symbol of support for Maduro, and many citizens opposed to the government don't carry it. It is unclear if pregnant women without the card will still receive the government handouts.   Maduro estimated that about 151,000 pregnant women would soon receive the monthly payments.   -- Stefano Pozzebon contributed reporting to this article from Caracas  "
218,218,Will U.S. shale ruin the oil party (again)?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/15/investing/oil-prices-shale-fracking/index.html,"Jan 15, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   It has surged 7% so far in 2018 and hit a three-year high of $64.81 a barrel on Monday, reflecting confidence that an epic supply glut may finally be over because of production cuts by OPEC and Russia.   ""The market has gone really high, really fast,"" said Michael Tran, energy strategist at RBC Capital Markets. ""The oil market has reached the healthiest state in several years.""   But is the infamously boom-and-bust oil industry setting itself up for disappointment? Crude is so high that it could trigger a ""drill, baby, drill"" mentality from U.S. shale oil producers who will once again flood the market with supply and drive down prices.   That's exactly what happened in early 2017, derailing a rally in crude and setting up months of pain.   U.S. shale producers need oil to be expensive enough to give them incentive to pump, and prices have once again reached that sweet spot.   The U.S. Energy Information Administration was already forecasting record high U.S. oil production in 2018. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian research firm. is even more optimistic, predicting America will surpass Russia and Saudi Arabia later this year as the world's No. 1 oil producer.   ""Significant growth from U.S. production can play spoiler and torpedo the oil market,"" Tran said.   That would be good news for American drivers. The average gallon of gasoline fetched $2.53 on Monday, compared with $2.34 a year ago, according to AAA.     Related: America could become oil king of the world in 2018   The smart money seems unfazed by the fracking threat and thinks oil will go even higher. Bullish bets on crude oil as measured by the CFTC hit a record high last week, while bets against oil tumbled to their lowest since June 2014, according to research firm JBC Energy.   ""No one wants to miss out on this rally,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.   But Smith and JBC Energy warned that extremes in financial positioning can quickly reverse.   The bullish bets are a ""clear red flag"" that could lead to a ""snowballing effect"" where selling begets more selling, JBC analysts wrote.   For now, the oil bulls are clearly in control. The big driver: Oil stockpiles have shrunk significantly, relieving the overarching concern that caused crude to crash to $26 a barrel in early 2016. U.S. oil inventories have dropped by 13% over the past year, according to the EIA.   The diminished stockpiles make oil prices more susceptible to sudden disruptions in the oil market. Late last year, crude soared because of temporary supply outages in Libya and the North Sea. In the past few years, those types of disturbances had little impact because the supply glut acted as a cushion.     Another positive for oil prices: The appetite for crude oil is strong. The U.S. and global economies are growing faster, driving demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.   Crude has also benefited from a paradigm shift in the oil market. In late 2015, Congress repealed a 40-year ban on oil exports, which meant American producers suddenly had customers around the world to buy their excess supply. U.S. oil exports soared to record highs, further easing the oversupply problem.   Related: Big Apple to Exxon: Pay us billions for climate change   Now everyone is wondering whether U.S. frackers in Texas, North Dakota and elsewhere will unleash another flood of shale oil that keeps a lid on prices.   The bulls are hoping that U.S. shale companies have learned their lesson and will show more discipline. They also note that the sharp drop in oil stockpiles means it would take a lot more shale to disrupt the market this time.   After speaking to a range of oil producers, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Singer said many are signaling caution about ramping up output aggressively. ""Most emphasized the importance of discipline,"" Singer wrote in a recent report.   JBC Energy, on the other hand, said it expects U.S. crude to ""overwhelm the market"" once again. The firm pointed out that the Baker Hughes tally of active U.S. oil rigs jumped last week by the most since June.   Tran, the RBC analyst, predicted a ""very strong production response from U.S. producers"" because they've become ""anti-fragile.""   Each time U.S. shale gets knocked down, Tran said, ""it comes back faster and more efficient than ever before."" "
219,219,Why the U.S. dollar isn't so mighty anymore,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/15/investing/weak-dollar/index.html,"Jan 15, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The U.S. dollar has already lost nearly 2% of its value against other currencies and is trading at its lowest level in more than three years. This follows a 10% decline for the dollar in 2017.   What's going on? At first blush, the drop is a bit of a mystery because the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for the past year.   Rate hikes usually boost the dollar's value because they cause more foreign investors to buy American assets. They also help keep inflation in check.   The U.S. economy has enjoyed two consecutive quarters of solid growth as well, and strong holiday sales suggest that trend continued at the end of the year. Many experts are predicting even more momentum for the economy from the recent tax cuts.   But take a step back and it shouldn't be a surprise that the dollar is slumping. Nor should it be a major concern just yet.   Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, an online currency brokerage firm, wrote in a report Monday that signs of life in Europe's economy, particularly Germany and France, are causing some investors to flock to the euro instead of the dollar.   Sayed added that the resurgence in Europe even has more investors betting that the European Central Bank will unwind its massive bond-buying program, similar to the Fed's after the 2008 financial crisis, sooner than expected.   Related: Dollar starts 2018 on the wrong foot   That would push up European bond yields and make the euro even more attractive compared with the dollar. Some even speculate that the ECB could start to raise interest rates later this year or early next year.   So the dollar's ""weakness"" may be only relative. Europe is on the mend, and investors are betting on that.   But the dollar's slide can't be pinned entirely on what's happening overseas. Some analysts suggest that political dysfunction in the United States is also pushing the dollar down.   Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a report Monday that ""there is more to dollar weakness than just the global feel-good story.""   Schlossberg said more investors are starting to believe there is a real chance of a government shutdown in Washington later this week. That would happen Friday unless Congress passes a short-term funding resolution to keep the government open.   ""The weakness in the buck suggests that the move is political as well as economic as global investors grow increasingly concerned about the chaos in Washington DC,"" Schlossberg said in his report.   It's unclear whether a deal can be reached given Republican opposition to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program. Under DACA, undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children are protected from deportation.   President Trump has hinted that he might be willing to make a deal with Democrats, but only if they back his plan for tougher security measures on the Mexican border. That may be a non-starter.   The growing controversy about Trump's reported reference to El Salvador, Haiti and African nations as ""shithole countries"" has only made things more uncertain. Trump has even taken the unusual step of denying that he's a racist.   ""After the rancor of the past few days, the risk of the government shutdown has increased and that factor could be weighing on the dollar as well,"" Schlossberg added.   Related: The dollar's Trump bump has vanished   But will the dollar's weakness actually hurt the U.S. economy or stock market? So far that doesn't seem to be the case. In fact, it might even help.   Trump said on several occasions in 2017 that he thought the dollar was too strong and wouldn't mind if it lost some of its value -- despite his ""America First"" agenda.   A weaker dollar lifts the value of foreign sales and profits for U.S. multinational companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG) once they are translated back into dollars.   And many of those giant U.S. firms have helped lead the market to numerous record highs in the past year.   It's true that a continued (and steeper) decline in the dollar could eventually become a problem. A massive dollar dump could bring about a big surge in inflation that nobody would want.   But that scenario seems unlikely anytime soon. Despite the wackiness in Washington, most global investors still view the dollar as the world's most stable reserve currency. The euro, China's yuan, gold and bitcoin are unlikely to replace the greenback just yet. "

President Donald Trump is going to Davos for the World Economic Forum -- and he's taking many members of his cabinet with him. Davos is famous for being a gathering of heads of state as well as CEOs and other high-powered corporate executives. Considering Trump's ""drain the swamp"" platform, it is a bit eye-raising that he will be attending an event that personifies global elites.   The White House says President Trump will be there to discuss his ""America First"" policy. What this means exactly is not clear. I think it is safe to assume there will be some carrots and some sticks in his approach. The visit will be part victory lap...reminding the participants that his election was a rejection by U.S. voters of what Davos is all about. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted that would be the case, saying before the trip that the president was not there to rub elbows with the rich.   Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox   I will be watching for evidence of hypocrisy at Davos. CEOs may like the lower tax rates and deregulation Trump has brought about. But many of his policies -- reversing efforts to combat climate change, restricting immigration, and putting up trade barriers -- are antithetical to what Davos attendees support.   If Trump wasn't going to Davos I bet he would have been excoriated by many business leaders and heads of NGOs from liberal Europe. Let's see how many of them raise a voice over Trump's stances on Iran and Russia now that he is attending. Or will they instead ""play the game"" and keep quiet, happy to be able to brag they are at Davos, with the president, improving the state of the world?        China is the biggest foreign holder of Treasuries. That's why a Bloomberg report which suggested China may halt its purchases of U.S. debt sent the bond market into a tailspin. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury spiked to their highest level in nearly a year.   The stock market is shrugging off these concerns for now. But can that last?   Some worry that inflation pressures will return later this year and force the Federal Reserve to raise rates more quickly than expected. That could make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money, slow down the economy and put a damper on corporate profits.   -- Paul R.

And Buffett himself is now worth more than $87 billion, according to estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg.   But Buffett is 87-years old. He won't be CEO of Berkshire Hathaway forever. That may be the reason why the company decided to name two top Berkshire Hathaway lieutenants to the company's board Wednesday: Greg Abel, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, and Ajit Jain, executive vice president of Berkshire Hathaway's National Indemnity Company insurance subsidiary.

The century-old camera brand said Tuesday it is investing in blockchain technology and plans to launch a ""photo-centric cryptocurrency"" called KODAKCoin.   Kodak (KODK)'s stock surged as much as 125% in trading after the announcement.   With the price of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and other digital currencies skyrocketing, an eclectic mix of small, unrelated businesses has attempted to ride the wave of investor interest by teasing cryptocurrency pivots.   Long Island Iced Tea Corp. changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp (LBCC). Bioptix rebranded as Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and shifted its business model from biotech to bitcoin.

Oil production fell in December to one of its lowest points in three decades, further depriving the cash-strapped country of its only major source of revenue and adding to the suffering of its people.   Venezuela produced 1.7 million barrels of oil a day, according to S&P Global Platts, which polled industry officials, traders and analysts and reviewed proprietary shipping data.   That's the lowest since 2002, when a failed coup temporarily took hold of the government-run oil company, PDVSA.   Other than that, oil production is the lowest in 28 years. It's down 27% just since 2014, when the country's economic crisis took hold, according to OPEC and S&P figures.   Related: Venezuela plants its own version of bitcoin   The decline in oil production is prolonging the misery for 30 million Venezuelans.   People there are losing weight because of food shortages, and children are dying in hospitals because basic medicine and equipment aren't available.   Malaria, infant deaths and maternal deaths have all increased significantly, official figures show. The government uses money from oil exports to buy what little food and medicine actually make it in.   It's also a sign of mismanagement by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who succeeded the late Hugo Chavez in 2013. And it couldn't come at a worse time: Venezuela has defaulted on some of its debt and owes a lot more.   In total, Venezuela has defaulted on $1.2 billion, according to Caracas Capital, a firm in Miami that tracks the country's debt. That's a relatively small sum in the world of bonds. The trouble is that it's a sign of what's to come, experts say.   Venezuela and PDVSA owe bondholders more than $60 billion. So far, Wall Street is waiting to get paid instead of fighting a long legal battle with Maduro's administration.   Experts say a default on all Venezuela's debt would spell immediate trouble for Maduro's regime. If enough investors of the defaulted debt trigger an ""acceleration"" clause, meaning they want immediate repayment, investors holding all other Venezuelan bonds can make the same claim.   Related: 'Death spiral': 4,000% inflation in Venezuela    Investors are used to late payments from Venezuela, which is notoriously behind schedule. They wait because Venezuelan bonds pay hefty returns, with rates as high as 12.75%. By comparison, a typical 10-year U.S. bond pays 2.5% interest.   But Wall Street is starting to sour on Venezuela's lucrative bonds. PDVSA's bond maturing in 2022 is trading at 25 cents on the dollar, down from 48 cents in early November, according to MarketAxess BondTicker.   If investors give up and trigger the acceleration clause, they have the right to seize Venezuelan oil that's in the United States or on tankers in the ocean as collateral.   That would cut off the government's ability to bring in what little revenue it has. And that would cause more suffering for ordinary Venezuelans struggling to live through severe shortages of food and medicine. "

Nvidia (NVDA) provides critical technology for some of the hottest sectors out there, including self-driving cars and bitcoin mining.   During a nearly two-hour event at CES in Las Vegas on Sunday night, Nvidia announced a laundry list of new big-name partners, ranging from Volkswagen (VLKAF) to Uber and Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU).   Nvidia is blossoming -- and shows no signs of slowing down. There are 320 companies using its products for self-driving vehicle technology. Wall Street has noticed: Nvidia's share price has doubled in the past eight months.   ""It's amazing how they started with such humble beginnings,"" Amitabh Varshney, a University of Maryland computer science professor, told CNN Tech. ""At first, they were targeting literally teenagers and gamers.""   Related: CES kicks off with oddball gadgets   Founded in 1993, Nvidia started off selling computer cards that improved the performance of video games. But it's since expanded into bigger and pricier areas. Today, one Nvidia product, the DGX, can cost as much as $149,000.   Nvidia's secret sauce is its computer chips, called graphical processing units (GPUs).   The company's breakout moment came about a decade ago when researchers experimented with using its GPUs for artificial intelligence. The results were a game-changer.   ""What's happened to Nvidia is amazing,"" Pedro Domingos, a University of Washington computer science professor, told CNN Tech. ""Once Nvidia realized its chips were popular with artificial intelligence researchers, it seized the market.""   As the first company to develop GPUs for artificial intelligence, it enjoyed an advantage over competitors that it still holds today. The chips use parallel processing, which is ideal for tasks such as image recognition.   According to Gartner analyst Michael Ramsey, Nvidia has smartly invested in helping other businesses find ways to use its technology.   ""CEO Jensen Huang reminds me of a less crazy Elon Musk,"" Ramsey said. ""Nvidia seems to be setting a new curve of dramatic improvement where every year they come out with something smaller, faster and more efficient.""   Its latest product is called Xavier, which has a huge amount of computing power. It includes 9 billion transistors and delivers 30 trillion operations per second. It is the product of more than $2 billion in research and development.

""Nvidia won the first round,"" he said. ""But they and Intel and the others know there will be more rounds after this."" "

""Investors are starting to feel a little too overconfident for my liking,"" Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in a recent report. ""There is a clearly a confidence I haven't seen in 10 years.""   Cox added that his clients seem more willing to make big purchases like second homes and new cars and to spend more on travel.   You could twist FDR's famous quote and say that the only thing investors have to fear right now is the lack of fear itself. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index, a measure of seven indicators of market sentiment, is close to Extreme Greed levels.   It's true that the market's epic run does little to help many everyday Americans. A lot of people got out of stocks after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. And if they didn't get out then, the 2008 financial crash scared many away for good.   But for the traders and other investors who have stuck with stocks, the market's recent surge has them dreaming about (and chasing) more speculative investments.   Related: The Dow is off to its best start since 2003   Vincent Catalano, global investment strategist with Blue Marble Research, said that he's getting more calls from people looking to get rich quick on really risky stocks like cryptocurrency companies tied to bitcoin as well as cobalt miners in Alaska and China.   ""There's increased interest in pump-and-dump-type stocks,"" Catalano said. ""Sentiment is quite ebullient.""   In a tweet last week, Catalano noted some research from the well-regarded investment firm The Leuthold Group that shows that the broader market tends to pull back a bit following periods of extreme investor optimism.  and here's what typically follows such readings. pic.twitter.com/KLzsb8skcO  Catalano isn't worried that a major crash or bear market is coming. He said continued low interest rates should be good for stocks. And market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are all expected to keep posting strong earnings.   But stocks are getting more expensive and reflect much of this optimism already.   ""You may want to be cautious right now,"" Catalano said. ""Fundamentals are good, but that's priced in. I'm a little uneasy. The music is playing and I'm dancing, but I'm staying close to the door to get ready to exit.""   Related: The Dow tops 25,000 for the first time    Others are starting to get a little more nervous, too.

231,231,A 3-step plan to a secure retirement,http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/03/pf/secure-retirement/index.html,"Jan 3, 2018","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," You're already off to a good start in that you're at least aware you need to have an actual plan in place if you want a shot at a comfortable retirement. Too many people approach the whole retirement planning thing haphazardly, throwing whatever money they think they can spare at the moment into whatever investments happen to be popular at the time with no overall strategy.   Small wonder that recent research shows that far too many people simply don't have a very accurate sense of whether they're actually on track to a secure post-career life.   Fortunately, it's not all that difficult to put together a simple-but-effective plan that can place you on the path toward a successful retirement and, just as important, help you periodically assess whether you're making sufficient progress toward that goal.   Here are the three main steps you need to take to put such a plan in place:   1. Set a realistic annual savings target -- and try to raise it over time. It's impossible to know exactly how much you need to save each year to ensure you'll have a nest egg large enough to support you throughout a retirement that can last 30 or more years. There are just too many unknowns (how the financial markets will perform, how much income you'll actually need in retirement, how long you'll live) for such precision.   Generally, though, many financial advisers recommend setting aside a minimum of 10% of pay in retirement accounts each year and preferably shooting for 15%, which is the figure cited for a typical household in a Boston College Center For Retirement Research study titled ""How Much Should People Save?""   Those percentages may seem daunting if you're not used to saving regularly. But remember, to the extent you save for retirement through a 401(k) or workplace plan, your employer may kick in matching funds that also count toward your savings goal.   Related: How much income will you actually need in retirement?   Of course, setting a reasonable savings target and hitting it can be two different things. As a family with two young kids, you and your husband no doubt already have plenty of competing financial demands on your income even before factoring savings into the equation. So how can you meet your regular expenses while also saving for retirement?   Basically, you do the best you can. Start by saving a percentage of your salary you think you can manage -- whether it's 5%, 8%, 10% or whatever -- and then work on increasing that amount gradually, say, by one percentage point a year. This strategy of starting small and boosting your savings rate year by year can dramatically increase the eventual size of your retirement accounts. The most important thing, though, is to start saving some amount now, as the sooner you begin stashing money away, the more time it will have to compound and grow, and the bigger the nest egg you'll have to help fund your retirement.   2. Keep your retirement investments -- and your investing strategy -- simple. One of the biggest mistakes people make when investing their retirement savings is trying to do too much. They scan the performance charts in hopes of identifying hot investments that will continue to generate outsize gains. Or they snap up every new mutual fund, ETF and ""alt"" investment Wall Street churns out, figuring that the more investments they own, the better diversified their portfolio will be and the better it will perform.   Unfortunately, this approach can backfire, as today's top performers may be tomorrow's laggards and the more you expand your investment options beyond an essential core, the greater the risk you'll end up with an unwieldy jumble of overlapping holdings that's difficult to manage.   Related: Why you shouldn't add Bitcoin to your retirement portfolio   All of which is to say you're better off keeping it simple. Start by setting a target mix of stocks and bonds that jibes with your needs and risk tolerance. The younger you are, the more you'll probably want to tilt your mix toward stocks, as more equity exposure should generate higher returns over the long run. So a couple your age will likely want to invest 70% or more of its assets in a diversified portfolio of stock funds and the rest in bond funds. But you can more accurately gauge how to divvy up your retirement portfolio between stock and bond funds by checking out Vanguard's asset allocation-risk tolerance tool.   As for which stock and bonds you should own, ideally you want investments that give you exposure to a wide swath of the stock and bond markets. That means funds that invest in both large and small and growth and value shares in the case of stocks and both government and high-quality corporate issues in the case of bonds. While I wouldn't say it's an absolute necessity, it's also a good idea to include international stocks, and possibly international bonds, in the mix.   The simplest -- and cheapest -- way to do this is to build a portfolio of broadly diversified stock and bond index funds. If you're investing through a 401(k) or similar plan that doesn't offer such funds, you can try to emulate that broad exposure by putting together a group of actively managed stock and bond funds that provide similar exposure to the broad stock and bond markets. But if the whole idea of investing your retirement funds makes your brain freeze and your eyes glaze over, you can go with an option like a target-date retirement fund or managed account -- or, for that matter, seek help from an adviser.   Your aim, though, is to assemble at a portfolio of funds that will give you exposure to the stock and bond markets at a reasonable cost and allow you to grow the value of your retirement savings throughout your career. Once you have that portfolio, you largely want to stick with it regardless of what's going on in the financial markets, although you'll likely need to rebalance every now and then to maintain your target stocks-bonds mix.   3. Monitor your progress -- and stay flexible. Even the most meticulous retirement plan can't predict the many twists, turns and pitfalls you may run into on the road to retirement: severe market setbacks that can put a major dent in your account balances, bouts of unemployment that may derail your savings regimen, financial reversals or health issues that might force you to dip into your savings, etc. Which is why you'll want to periodically re-assess whether you're making progress toward a secure retirement and, if necessary, make adjustments to your plan.   You can do that by going to a retirement calculator that uses Monte Carlo simulations to make its projections and entering such information as your age, income, current savings balance, the amount you're saving each year and when you plan to retire. The tool will then estimate the probability that you'll be able to retire on schedule with enough income from Social Security and your savings to support you the rest of your life if you continue with your current plan.   Related: How should I invest my retirement savings for safety and income?   If your chances of being able to retire on schedule with the income you'll need are too low for comfort -- say, a projected success rate of less than 70% to 80% -- or if your chances have declined since the last time you went through this exercise, then you'll probably want to re-run the analysis to see how much such tweaks such as saving more, investing differently or postponing retirement a few years can improve your prospects.   Just to be clear: Such projections and estimates of your chances of success aren't guarantees. No calculator or software, no matter how sophisticated, can predict the future, or know whether you'll stick to your savings and investing regimen throughout your career. But creating a plan and checking ever so often to see whether you're making progress toward a secure retirement is certainly better than winging it, which is to say having no plan at all. "

In recent weeks, ripple's value has spiked, making it the second most valuable digital currency and bringing it newfound attention.   The relatively obscure cryptocurrency, also known as XRP, is now worth about $2.60 with a market cap of more than $100 billion, according to Coinmarketcap. In early December, it was trading at just 25 cents.   Even with the spike, ripple is worth considerably less than bitcoin. After a tumultuous December, bitcoin was trading around $15,000 late Tuesday with a market cap of more than $250 billion.   Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment   What's different about ripple is its supply is largely controlled by just one company, San Francisco-based Ripple. There are reports of current and former Ripple executives becoming cryptocurrency billionaires from its recent boom.   Ripple launched in 2012 to facilitate global financial transactions. It differentiates itself from other digital currency platforms by its connections to legitimate banks. Companies that use the Ripple platform include Santander (SANPRA), Bank of America (BAC) and UBS (UBS).  This is a modal window.     In recent weeks, financial services companies in Japan and South Korea have adopted Ripple's technology, helping boost the price of the cryptocurrency.   Related: What the big names of finance are saying about bitcoin   According to Stephen Powaga, head of research at investment firm Blockchain Momentum, ripple and other some other cryptocurrencies have relatively low transaction fees, which made them popular when people began looking for alternatives to bitcoin.   But unlike Bitcoin, ripple isn't created, or ""mined,"" by users. The company has control.   It created 100 billion ripple coins initially, and 38 billion of them are in circulation at the moment. Ripple management can release up to 1 billion coins per month, which Powaga predicts could oversaturate the market.  This is a modal window.     ""It's somewhat concerning for me because if they chose to release them as quickly as possible, within a little over four years, you'd see more than a doubling of supply of ripple,"" he said.   That could put pressure on its price.   ""I'm not certain that some of the newer market participants are fully appreciating the potential for inflation,"" Powaga said.   Related: Hackers take advantage of bitcoin's wild ride   Cross-border payments that can take hours with bitcoin or days with traditional financial transactions can go through in a matter of seconds with ripple, the company says.   Like bitcoin, ripple's payment network, RippleNet, uses blockchain technology.   A blockchain is a public ledger containing transaction data from anyone who uses the service.

Just as bitcoin has skyrocketed in value and popularity, so has the attention given to the digital currency by law enforcement agencies, making it a less attractive method of payment in the criminal world.   Europe's top law enforcement official -- Europol executive director Rob Wainwright -- tweeted Tuesday that there will be a ""progressive shift in 2018 towards criminal use of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin.""   That shift makes it ""more challenging for law enforcement to counter,"" he added.   Experts say bitcoin is becoming too mainstream, and therefore too risky, for criminals.   Related: Bitcoin mania: What the big names of finance are saying   ""The fact that bitcoin is constantly in the spotlight makes it more valuable for investors, but certainly less valuable for its earliest fans -- criminals -- giving rise to interest in other alternative cryptos designed to avoid tracking,"" said Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.   The number of cases where criminals have been identified through bitcoin tracing is increasing, according to Europol. Companies such as Elliptic and Chainalysis specialize in tracking bitcoin transactions, linking them to companies and individuals, and they work closely with law enforcement agencies.     Bitcoin may be challenging to track, but each transaction provides investigators with information that can lead them to the IP addresses of the computers sending and receiving the payment, the amount of bitcoins transferred and a timestamp, according to a Europol spokesperson.   That could be enough to identify those behind the transactions.   ""This is, however, not true for some cryptocurrencies, which purposefully make the transactions hidden,"" the spokesperson added.   Related: Why everyone is talking about ripple   Europol highlighted several cryptocurrencies it says are growing in popularity among criminals: monero, ethereum, dash and zcash.   According to Europol data, bitcoin used to account for roughly 90% of the cryptocurrency market until 2016. It now stands at 36%.   Monero, which was launched in 2014, offers even higher levels of privacy than bitcoin. Its technology makes it impossible to attribute transactions to any particular user or IP address.   Europol said monero is being accepted on several darkweb markets and has already been used in a ransomware attack.   Monero is currently trading at around $400 a piece. It was worth just $16 a year ago.   Bianchi explained that monero units are indistinguishable from one another, meaning that every unit of the currency can be substituted by another.   ""This makes monero different from public-ledger cryptocurrencies, where [IP] addresses previously associated with undesired activity can be blacklisted and refused by network members,"" he added. "

But as we wrote at the beginning of December, the booming stock market and rock-bottom unemployment rate mask enormous lingering distress, with household net worth still a fraction of what it used to be.   Many readers wrote in about their journeys since the recession. Although some had rebounded from a lost job or a drained retirement fund, many have been permanently knocked off their financial course. Some feel the tax bill won't meaningfully change their standard of living, and that wealthy people have gotten more help from both the Trump and Obama administrations.    Here are a few of their stories.      Landscape architect Dan Donohue and his wife, who ran marketing and accounting for their small firm in Batavia, Illinois, had been through downturns before in his 25 years of experience. But the Great Recession, which brought to a halt the real estate development they counted on, knocked them out.   Related: 10 years after the recession began, have Americans recovered?   With no business and four young kids to feed, Donohue says he applied to hundreds of jobs. At various points, he commuted 153 miles each way for a part-time teaching position at Purdue University that paid $16,000 per semester, worked as an aide in a middle school for $11 an hour, and even took a landscape architectural internship for a park district.   The fall from middle class life to near-poverty was swift, and forced the family to forgo even the smallest of luxuries. Donohue recalls explaining to a frustrated teacher that he couldn't afford to pay for his daughter's field trip.   ""The teacher stated: 'But it's only $6,'"" recalls Donohue, 57. ""And I said, 'yes, it is only $6, but it's $6 I don't have for a field trip.'""   After going back to school for a master's degree in special education, Donohue now makes about $55,000 a year as an elementary school teacher, and his wife works for a state-run science and math boarding school. They managed to keep their house with the help of an 18-month mortgage assistance program, but the schooling has left them with a pile of debt.   To Donohue, it all feels a little unfair.   ""Jamie Dimon, and many others on Wall Street took bailout money and gave themselves million-dollar bonuses,"" he says. ""But thousands of others like myself are now indentured servants to credit card debt and school loans.""      After 35 years as a contractor for NASA, electrical engineer Peter Young was starting to imagine his retirement party.   It had been a good career: Young met his wife Joan at Goddard Space Flight Center, where he worked on the construction, testing, debugging and launching of satellites. They had two kids and a house in the Maryland suburbs.   But by 2011, with the end of the space shuttle program, work available to contractors started to dwindle as spacecraft construction at Goddard nearly ceased. The public's appetite for big spending on space exploration faded as the federal budget came under strain, and budget cuts forced cutbacks NASA-wide.   ""I spent those two years conducting an intensive job search outside of NASA, which yielded nothing,"" says Young, 66. ""I couldn't even give my services away.""   By 2013, unemployment paid more than the few hours of work Young was able to get. The Youngs drew down their 401(k) accounts to keep paying the mortgage, but still ended up losing their house to foreclosure, and moved into their adult son's apartment. They received food stamps and frequented food banks — something they never expected to need.     Within a year, Joan came into a small inheritance, allowing them to buy a small house in central Maryland. There, Pete started a small business repairing radios and amplifiers, finding customers through Facebook. It's been a tough go — with his credit ruined, he's working with no startup capital, and can only slowly accumulate the equipment needed to take on bigger projects.   Starting over again, in a very different financial state than what he'd planned for, has given new importance to intangible kinds of wealth.   ""We have always felt that as long as we had each other, everything else, all the material possessions are relatively unimportant and can be replaced,"" Young says. ""Life knocked us flat and, like many people, the process of getting back on our feet changed our outlook on life and made us better people.""      When you start at the bottom, there's nowhere to go but up — especially if you have a few lucky breaks along the way.   That's what John Diltz learned, in his journey from working a $24,000 non-profit job to becoming a successful banker who now lives in a tony Orlando suburb that is also home to the likes of Shaquille O'Neal.   After marrying and graduating from college in 2003, Diltz and his wife Erica got their real estate licenses and started selling houses in Florida. They did alright, but had no retirement accounts and no stock portfolio and they were still shopping with coupons and eating at McDonalds.   In 2007, they moved to rural Alabama to be closer to family, buying a house on five acres for $190,000. As the recession loomed, the real estate market there was bad and getting worse, and so Diltz decided to get an investment license and try something else.   ""Banking kind of came just because of the misfortune of my career,"" he recalls. ""At the moment, it was like, 'oh gosh this is scary.' But It opened my eyes to a whole new career.""   Related: 2017 was a great year to be rich   The new job in business lending came with a steady salary, plus health insurance and a 401(k). Their house in Alabama hadn't appreciated very much during the bubble, and didn't depreciate in the crash. Diltz saw friends and family go through tough times all around him — like the uncle who sold his stocks at the bottom of the market and bought gold as the price peaked — but he and Erica were just getting started.   In 2010, he took a job at JPMorgan Chase in Orlando, making a relatively comfortable $72,000 a year. Now 36, Diltz' retirement account has grown steadily, riding the stock market's long rise from its nadir in 2009.   But he still keeps about 40% of it in cash and treasuries, just in case.   ""I've always been so risk averse because of all that that happened,"" Diltz says. ""You know your retirement's 20 years away, don't act like it's your first day, when you can put everything in bitcoin.""      Among the industries hardest hit by the Great Recession, nonprofits ranked near the top.   As charitable donations dried up, so did Linda Maddox's job as a grant writer for an organization supporting at-risk youth in Atlanta. She was laid off in 2012, and even after half a dozen interviews, couldn't find another steady position for two and a half long years.   During that time, Maddox lost her apartment and became a transient, moving five times between friends' houses. Unemployment benefits ended after a year, and she picked up odd jobs, from dog walking to working the flower stand at Costco. Meanwhile, she had to care for her father, who had just been diagnosed with cancer and dementia.   ""My dog died, my dad died, my car blew up,"" remembers Maddox, now 59 and childless. ""And I'm wearing myself out, because I'm exhausted.""   With her savings drained and credit card debt racking up, she was relieved in late 2014 to land another grant writing position at a non-profit that provides healthy meals to the sick and the elderly, making about as much as she had been before.   Maddox has saved enough to pay off most of her debt and put a down payment on a condo, which is cheaper than renting in Atlanta's hot housing market. At this point, she thinks she'll be able to retire when she's 70. But she hasn't put the experience behind her.   ""It feels like PTSD,"" Maddox says. ""You have to feed yourself, and you're afraid it's going to happen again. Emotionally, it's not over when it's over, because you have this paranoia. If it hadn't been for my friends, I don't know that I'd be here.""      Allan Fawcett lost about half his net worth in the stock market crash — not atypical for the American household. His recovery, however, wasn't typical at all.   As a computer consultant working for Warner Brothers in Burbank, California, through the 2000s, Fawcett made $65 an hour and had excellent job security, since the company needed him for a set of large, critical projects. As the financial crisis unfolded around him, even as his stock portfolio shriveled, he realized that steady income allowed him to qualify for loans that few others could get.   ""I was just fortunate to have a very good job that allowed me to buy into any real estate that I wanted,"" Fawcett remembers. ""Everybody else went into protective mode, but a lot of us said 'it'll turn around.'""   Related: Most Americans aren't benefiting from the stock market boom   Fawcett bought two condos in San Diego, which generated steady rental income, and a house in the Burbank hills. With no children, he had no other mouths to feed. Meanwhile, he changed his stock strategy, taking advantage of market volatility to generate higher returns. By 2014, he says his net worth had tripled.   At that point, the consulting work had become harder to come by, but Fawcett figured he could make enough from his investments to live on. While traveling around Europe, he fell in love with a woman in Barcelona. They married last year, and he moved to Spain to live with her. Now 61, he's a year away from being able to claim Social Security — and so far, so good.   ""We've had a bull market for the past 10 years,"" Fawcett says. ""I keep thinking it's going to drop really soon and I need to find work again, but I've got a lucky star somewhere."" "

The jackpot's now at $418 million. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. North and South Korea The North and South are talking again, on a hotline they hadn't used for two years. The North Koreans made the call this morning (on Kim Jong Un's orders), talking with their South Korean counterparts for about 20 minutes. We don't know what they said, but it's a welcome sign and a big diplomatic breakthrough that could jump-start more talks in the future. Meanwhile, President Trump communicated with Kim the old-fashioned way -- via Twitter. After Kim warned the US that ""the nuclear button is always"" on his desk, Trump boasted he has one, too, and that it's ""much bigger & more powerful."" Well, of course. CNN's Jake Tapper was kind enough to remind us (once again) that none of this is normal, just in case we'd forgotten. 2. Politics With Orrin Hatch calling it quits in the Senate, don't be surprised if Mitt Romney makes a run at the seat. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee hasn't said if he's running, but his Twitter account just happened to be updated the same day to note that he calls Utah home. Coincidence? Romney in the Senate would be quite interesting, since he's become one of the most prominent so-called ""never Trumpers"" on the political right. And it's beginning to look a lot like 2012 in these early days of 2018, with other prominent 2012 GOP presidential rivals -- former Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Rep. Michele Bachmann -- both said to be mulling jumping into the race to permanently replace Democrat Sen. Al Franken in Minnesota. 3. Iran protests A new set of demonstrators hit the streets in Iran -- pro-government counter-protesters. These protesters waved Iranian flags and held signs voicing support for the government and its rulers. This comes after a week of anti-government demonstrations across the country, sparked by economic concerns and overall dissatisfaction with the government. These latest demonstrations are not a total surprise, since counter-protests are a common reaction to dissent against the government there. More than 20 people have died in the demonstrations, and more than 450 people have been arrested. 4. Joshua Boyle Joshua Boyle, the Canadian who spent five years in captivity with his family in Afghanistan, has been arrested. Boyle faces 15 charges, including assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement. All the charges are connected to incidents which allegedly happened after Boyle and his family returned to Canada in October. Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in Afghanistan by terrorists in 2012. Coleman was pregnant, and the couple had two more children during their five years in captivity. The family was freed in a mission carried out by Pakistani forces based on intelligence from US authorities. 5. Weather Oh yeah, this winter weather mess is about to get a whole lot worse. Already, there have been 11 cold-related deaths, and much of the nation is now due to stay in the deep freeze through the weekend. Now, the East Coast will have to deal with what meteorologists are calling a ""winter hurricane"" (it's technical name is even scarier: ""bombogenesis."") It'll bring hurricane-force winds and snow. Great. It'll start in Florida, of all places, where residents of places like Tallahassee -- which hasn't seen measurable snow in almost 30 years -- could get as much as an inch of snow and ice today. Coastal Georgia and the Carolinas will get some snow, too, before the storm plows up to the Northeast. NUMBERS OF THE DAY 1,500 The number of security barriers going up in high-profile locations in New York to help ward off terror attacks $1.6 billion That's the value of damages sought in a lawsuit that a music publishing company has filed against streaming giant Spotify.

The digital currency's price soared more than 1,300% last year, easily outgunning the returns from many traditional financial assets like stocks, bonds and gold.   But while bitcoin has gained greater mainstream acceptance in recent months, it still has a lot of critics. They warn about issues like its volatile price, absence of underlying assets and lack of regulation.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Here are some of the most memorable quotes from high-profile figures in the financial world:         ""If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold, it has a great potential left,"" billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said at an investment conference in October.   Thiel, an early investor in Facebook (FB), said he thinks people were ""maybe underestimating"" bitcoin. ""It's just a store of value, you don't actually need to use it to make payments,"" he said.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin: Here's what I learned      ""Long-term, directionally, it is a multitrillion-dollar asset,"" Cameron Winklevoss, who founded bitcoin exchange Gemini with his twin brother Tyler, said in December.

Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment      ""This is the greatest technology since the internet. This is a sociological transformation, it's a movement,"" Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper said in November.   Draper has previously backed the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Skype. He invested in bitcoin three years ago, buying thousands of the virtual coins, which are now worth more than $13,000 each.  This is a modal window.           ""If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day,"" Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), said in October, predicting governments would eventually ""crush it.""

He'd previously dismissed it as a ""fraud"" and threatened to fire any of his bankers who trade it -- although he has admitted his daughter owns some.

""You can't value bitcoin because it's not a value-producing asset,"" renowned investor Warren Buffett said in October. He added that its unpredictable price makes it a ""real bubble in that sort of thing.""   The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) CEO is a long-term skeptic. He labeled the digital currency a ""mirage"" back in 2014, when its price was a little over $600.   Related: Looking to sell bitcoin? It's complicated      ""Something that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud,"" Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in November.   He said Goldman (GS) didn't have a bitcoin strategy at that point. But he did leave the door open for the bank to trade the digital currency in the future if it becomes less volatile.   Related: Hackers take advantage of bitcoin's wild ride      ""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention. It doesn't serve any socially useful function,"" Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said in November.   The former World Bank chief economist warned that bitcoin ""ought to be outlawed."" "

242,242,"So, you got a tax cut. Now what?",http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/22/news/economy/spending-your-tax-cut/index.html,"Dec 22, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   So, how are people planning to spend their windfalls, which the Joint Tax Committee says will be worth $264 billion over the next two years?   It's an important question for the economy. Companies determine who benefits from tax cuts by whether they choose to put their extra cash into payouts to shareholders, wages and hires, or new investment. But spending by individuals accounts for more than two thirds of gross domestic product, so their decisions are arguably more important.   We know a few things from past tax cuts.   One, individuals don't always notice the change — it's just one of many factors that influence the amount of money in their pockets, including wages, rent, the price of gas, the cost of college. President Barack Obama passed a tax credit as part of the 2009 stimulus bill worth $400 per person, for example, but polls showed later that few people realized it.   Related: 34 things you need to know about the incoming tax law   Two, we know that people spend tax cuts differently depending on how much money they make. Economic theory generally says that lower-income people are more likely to spend any extra cash they get, while upper-income people are already spending as much as they want or need to spend, so they just sit on the money.   University of Chicago economist Owen Zidar found in a recent study that the theory holds: Places with a higher concentration of wealthy people saw less of an economic boost from tax cuts in the last 30 years than places with more poorer people.   By that logic, this tax cut isn't structured for growth. According to the Tax Policy Center's calculations, people in the bottom 90% of the income spectrum will see less than a 2% tax cut in 2018, while people in the top 5% see about a 4% cut.   We don't know what's going to happen with this tax bill. Consumer spending is already very healthy, with today's report showing 0.4% inflation-adjusted growth in November, driven by car purchases, recreation, and utility bills.   But when we asked readers, many of them said they'll save the extra money, or use it to pay off loans. That makes sense. Consumer debt is now at an all-time high. Delinquency rates are creeping upwards for auto loans and credit card debt, while people are behind on their student loans at almost as high a rate as ever.   If taxpayers decided to save the money, they'd be reversing a longstanding trend that only turned around for a short time after the recession, and putting themselves in a better position in case the economy stumbles.     Either way, research shows that consumers probably won't do much until the extra money actually shows up in their paychecks. For some people, that might happen as soon as February, after the IRS issues new rules for federal withholding. Others may need to wait until next tax season to see the difference.

243,243,Dow poised for best year since 2013,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/24/investing/stocks-week-ahead-dow/index.html,"Dec 24, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   It's been a merry year in the markets, with the Dow up an impressive 25%. That would be the best annual performance since 2013.   If a Santa Claus rally during this holiday-shortened week lifts the Dow above 26.5% on the year, it would be the strongest gain since 1995, when the blue-chip index spiked 33%.   It's not just the 30-stock Dow that's on fire. The broader S&P 500 has zoomed 20% this year, similarly on track for its best performance in four years. And the Nasdaq has left both behind, with surge of nearly 30%.   Unlike the chaos in turbulent bitcoin, the stock market chugged along all year without any real hiccups. Market freakouts proved to be fleeting -- and terrific buying opportunities. The S&P 500 hasn't even suffered a 3% pullback (over one or multiple days) since prior to the election. That's the longest stretch on record. Extreme calm has sent the VIX (VIX) volatility index to all-time lows.   The euphoria on Wall Street was driven by a combination of very healthy fundamentals -- strong economic and profit growth -- along with excitement about the Republican tax overhaul. The lowered corporate tax rate and incentives to return overseas profits could spark a wave of share buybacks that make stocks look even more attractive.     A critical question for 2018 is whether this experiment of adding stimulus to an already-healthy economy will have unintended consequences. The winning formula of the eight-year bull market in stocks has been steady growth, mysteriously-low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates from the Federal Reserve.   But what if the tax overhaul finally awakens inflation, forcing the Fed to accelerate rate hikes?   That could upset the ""goldilocks"" environment that has underpinned the bull market, making 2018 a more difficult year for investors to navigate.

247,247,Hackers take advantage of bitcoin's wild ride,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/22/technology/bitcoin-hackers/index.html,"Dec 22, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The hype around cryptocurrency is only growing, fueled by the massive rise of bitcoin, the digital currency created in 2009. Its value has skyrocketed by thousands of dollars in the last year, but the price fluctuates regularly.   As the hype grows, so does interest in acquiring digital currency -- both from the general public who might not know much about the technology and hackers who want to profit off it.   ""Whenever something gets this much publicity and popularity and there's a potential to make what appears to be free and easy money, the criminal aspects of the world are going to take advantage of it,"" said Mike Murray, vice president of security intelligence at mobile security firm Lookout.   In order to use bitcoin, you need a digital wallet to receive, send, and store cryptocurrencies. By creating fake wallets, hackers can take advantage of people new to bitcoin and other digital currencies who might not realize the difference between legitimate companies and fake apps.   Lookout recently discovered three fake bitcoin wallet Android apps in the Google Play Store that trick people into sending cybercriminals bitcoin. Some of the apps had thousands of downloads.   Google has since pulled them from the store.   Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment   ""They were clearly targeted at people who don't know anything about bitcoin, went on the Google Play Store, and started installing bitcoin stuff on their phone,"" Murray said.   In addition to fake apps, cybercriminals are creating malware that uses people's computers to generate cryptocurrencies in a process called ""mining.""   By hijacking a stranger's computer or phone, a hacker puts the work on those devices -- a typically costly and complicated process. Mining requires a lot of computing power to solve complicated math problems, verify transaction records and ultimately receive digital coins.   It's no longer feasible to mine bitcoin with personal computers, but you can do so for other currencies like Monero and Ethereum. Candid Wueest, principal threat researcher for security firm Symantec, said the explosive popularity of bitcoin is further sparking interest in other currencies, and malware creators are exploiting tools to mine them.   According to a report from Symantec, malicious mining activity is on the rise. A hacker can hide malicious code on a website and the site's users become digital currency miners without realizing it.   It can be a lucrative scheme. This week, hackers targeted websites using the Wordpress content management system to infect them with Monero mining malware. The attackers reportedly made at least $100,000.   Digital currency exchanges are also a popular target for hackers. On Wednesday, hackers compromised EtherDelta, a place for buying cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, South Korean bitcoin exchange Youbit said this week it was filing for bankruptcy after criminals stole almost one-fifth of its clients' holdings in the second major cyberattack on its systems this year.   Carles Lopez-Penalver, intelligence analyst at security firm Flashpoint, said phishing campaigns from hackers posing as cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, or other websites try to trick people into forking over currency or personal information. Some of these campaigns appear as advertisements on search engines and websites, or in Slack chatrooms where people discuss digital currencies.   Malicious attacks targeting digital currencies and users are only going to get worse, he said.   ""The will and drive to target cryptocurrency-oriented industry is here to stay because of the absurd money that has been pumped into it in the past couple of months,"" Lopez-Penalver said. ""It is one of the most targeted industries right now -- it's what cybercriminals are looking for."" "

Some experts note the economy is doing fine already and that the boost to the deficit that will likely come with the tax cuts could create problems down the road.   Cynics argue lower taxes may only help shareholders. FedEx said its profits could be boosted by $1.5 billion next year.

But 2018 could be a much different story.   Trump and his trade team are expected to announce the results of a few rare investigations into steel and aluminum imports. Experts say both cases are aimed at punishing China for what the Trump administration views as unfair trade practices.   There's another, separate, ongoing investigation into Chinese intellectual property theft.   And if Trump's Commerce Department steps up its tariffs on China next year, many believe China will respond with the same medicine.   -- Patrick Gillespie        The frenzy over bitcoin and blockchain doesn't seem to be going away.

The companies that have built a business out of taking adventurous travelers into the isolated country have been hit by a series of grim events.   President Trump has engaged in an unsettling war of words with Kim Jong Un as North Korea has ramped up its nuclear and missile tests; an American student detained in Pyongyang died soon after his release; and the U.S. government banned its citizens from visiting the country.   Business ""is down at least 50%"" since June, said Nicholas Bonner, one of the founders of Koryo Group, the biggest tour company taking Westerners into North Korea.   ""Bizarrely, you think it would be more, but a lot of people are still fascinated by what is going on in the country,"" Bonner, who has been taking tourists to North Korea for about 25 years, told CNNMoney.   Related: Report: 49 countries have been busting sanctions on North Korea   Since 2013, about 4,000 Western tourists a year had been traveling to North Korea.   The number of Chinese tourists, which make up the bulk of visitors to North Korea, is also reportedly down.      The U.S. government banned its citizens from traveling to North Korea after Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American student, died in June following a 17-month detention in North Korea. Americans are estimated to have accounted for about a fifth of Western tourists traveling to the country.   Despite Warmbier's death, Bonner, a British citizen, doesn't think travelers from other countries should shy away.   ""It's safe, provided you stand by the rules,"" he said. Brits, Germans, Australians and Canadians make up the majority of Koryo's clients.     Koryo, which is based in Beijing, gives all its customers an hour-long briefing before they go into the country, and staff stay with them throughout their travels.   ""Providing you understand it's not a holiday, it's an experience ... you can avoid any problems,"" Bonner said.   Related: Singapore Airlines changed U.S. route because of North Korean missiles   Koryo also vets potential tourists, trying to weed out people who may be visiting North Korea for reasons other than tourism.   In 2014, North Korean authorities detained an American citizen traveling with Koryo, Jeffrey Fowle, for five months. They accused him of leaving a bible at a club for foreign sailors, an act that they said violated North Korean law.      Companies like Koryo also face questions about the ethics of bringing business to one of the world's most repressive regimes. Western travelers often pay premium prices for organized tours.   Koryo's five-night New Year's Eve package invites customers to ""Celebrate into 2018 in style, in the DPRK!"" for €1,650 ($1,950). That's more than a North Korean's estimated average annual income, which stood at $1,300 in 2016.   Related: North Korea may be making a fortune from bitcoin mania   Tour package prices are set by the North Korean regime, which gets most of the money. Foreign tour operators just determine their own markup.   Bonner says Koryo only takes a modest cut from the final price.  This is a modal window.     And he defends his company's business from criticism that tourist dollars funnel hard currency to the North Korean regime, saying the amount of money involved is small.   ""We run a company of 12 people, we've taken half the tourists going in, and we've survived -- just,"" he said.   Related: What Americans will miss about going to North Korea   Bonner also insists that interactions between Westerners and North Koreans, however limited, are worthwhile.   ""I believe very strongly in engagement,"" he said. ""If you don't believe in engagement and soft power, fine -- then don't come on a trip, don't come and see much more.""   Besides tourism, Koryo has produced three documentaries on North Korea, and Bonner made a fictional film two years ago set in Pyongyang.   Related: Beyond propaganda posters: Everyday design in N.

A publicly traded company named Long Island Iced Tea Corp. (LTEA) -- which as the moniker implies is based on Long Island and makes iced tea -- is changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. and wants to buy some firms in the cryptocurrency business.   The stock surged nearly 200% on the news.   This is madness, pure and simple.   While it's clear that blockchain technology is important and that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, litecoin and ripple are not going away, there is now too much hype surrounding bitcoin and blockchain.   It's eerily similar to the internet stock craze in the late 1990s when several companies that weren't destined to become the next Amazon simply added a dotcom suffix or ""E"" prefix to their name and watched their stocks soar.   Long Island Iced Tea is just the latest small company to change its business model in an attempt to latch on to the bitcoin and cryptocurrency wave.   A company now called Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has soared since it changed its name from Bioptix and changed its business model from biotech to bitcoin.   LongFin (LFIN), a financial tech firm that recently went public, has skyrocketed after announcing that it bought a blockchain microlender.

It didn't say what the new symbol would be.   ""We view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry,"" said Long Island Iced Tea Corp. CEO Philip Thomas in a statement.   Here's the thing though. Long Island Iced Tea Corp. currently has no actual businesses tied to blockchain.   The company said it is in ""preliminary"" discussions to buy a blockchain software developer working on infrastructure for the financial services industry, as well as a London-based provider of foreign exchange services that is building blockchain and cryptocurrency technology solutions.   Related: Overstock is turning into a bitcoin tech firm   Long Island Iced Tea added that it ""does not have an agreement with any of these entities for a transaction and there is no assurance that a definitive agreement with these, or any other entity, will be entered into or ultimately consummated.""   In other words, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. hopes to one day become a crypto powerhouse.   But for now, it remains a tiny beverage company based in Farmingdale that reported total sales of just $1.6 million in its latest quarter and whose stock was down more than 40% this year before it decided to become a blockchain player.

Under Kim Jong Un, the country's totalitarian regime is overseeing a quiet consumer revolution. Long used to the state controlling how they eat, dress and travel, North Koreans have recently been getting more of a taste of Western-style capitalism.   ""People have access to more consumer goods and business opportunities than at any point in the past,"" said Curtis Melvin, a senior fellow with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.   Melvin, who studies North Korea's economy, says privately run pizza parlors, coffee shops, bars and gas stations have mushroomed in Pyongyang, the country's capital.   Related: Where North Korea's elite go for banned luxury goods   President Trump is pushing for increasingly tough international sanctions aimed at squeezing the life out of the North Korean economy. The sanctions are part of Trump's efforts to pressure Kim into backing down on the regime's rapidly developing nuclear weapons program.   But on the ground in North Korea, the government is allowing more entrepreneurial activity and even encouraging competition between small private firms.   ""In North Korea, now you can found your own company,"" said Andray Abrahamian, an Asia-Pacific research fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""A shop, a makeup company -- you can run it as your own, and keep most of the profit.""

North Koreans also have a choice in which taxi company they use, and which brand of toothpaste they buy.   That might not sound like a big deal to Western consumers used to an ever increasing choice of goods and services. But it's a huge change for North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries and a place where the state has historically controlled most aspects of citizens' lives.   Related: North Korea's economy: What's left to sanction?   Experts say that reflects how much the country's economy has changed under the rule of Western-educated Kim Jong Un, who took over as North Korea's leader after the death of his father Kim Jong Il six years ago.   ""He is more accepting of market activities"" compared to Kim Jong Il, said Kim Byung-yeon, an economics professor at Seoul National University who studies the North Korean economy.   The changes seem to have coincided with an economic uptick.     The regime doesn't publish any data, but an estimate from South Korea's central bank puts the North's economic growth at 3.9% in 2016, its fastest pace since the turn of the millennium.   That healthy figure comes despite more than a decade of international sanctions.   ""The economy is in a much better shape than 20, 10 and even five years ago,"" said Rudiger Frank, an economics professor at the University of Vienna who specializes in North Korea.   Related: How North Korea is hacking companies and governments   The flurry of entrepreneurship is believed to be providing a boost to the coffers of Kim's regime.   Most of those running these new shops and restaurants are likely to be privileged North Koreans with close ties to the government who are required to kick up a portion of profits to the regime.   ""The government and the party are probably making more money than ever"" because of them, Melvin said.  This is a modal window.     But there's a lot of uncertainty about whether the rise in private business activity will continue.   So far, it appears to be concentrated in Pyongyang, a showcase city for the regime that gets the lion's share of resources. Much of the rest of the country remains decades behind in wealth and technology.   Related: A journey into the heart of North Korea   And none of the market-friendly changes have been put into law, which means traders are still subject to the regime's whims.   For example, a botched currency reform by the government in 2009 stripped many North Koreans of their personal savings.   Experts also think North Korea is unlikely to follow the path of other centrally planned economies that have embraced capitalism, such as Russia and China.   Frank points to the example of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, who was booted from power shortly after implementing wide-scale reforms.   ""Kim is thus very cautious,"" he said.   Related: North Korea's mystery ship: The curious case of the Hao Fan 6   The intensifying sanctions, meanwhile, could throttle the amount of money and goods coming into the country.   They have targeted North Korea's major exports like coal, iron ore and seafood, nearly all of which were being sold across the border into China.   ""They are very effective in stifling the market economy,"" Frank said of the sanctions.  This is a modal window.     He told CNNMoney he has heard reports of a number of North Korean businesses shutting down as a result.   But many experts are still skeptical that the U.S.-led economic pressure will convince the North Korean government to change tack on its nuclear program.   Related: Why an oil embargo won't stop North Korea   Abrahamian said it's everyday citizens who are likely to suffer the most from sanctions that hurt North Korea's major industries.   ""The authorities are willing to pass along the economic pain to their citizens for a long time,"" he said. "

The cryptocurrency website Coinbase said it was looking into price movements that occurred shortly after Coinbase launched bitcoin cash on its exchange.   Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a message posted to his blog that it suspended trading of bitcoin cash after seeing a wild price increase on other exchanges before its launch.   ""If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies — directly or indirectly — I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action,"" said Armstrong in his blog.   Bitcoin cash is an alternative form of bitcoin that emerged in August. It features a change in the digital software that was designed to speed up the efficiency of transactions as the value of bitcoin ballooned.   Armstrong said that all Coinbase employees and contractors were ""explicitly prohibited"" more than a month ago from trading in bitcoin cash and from revealing launch plans.   Coinbase did allow some trades for bitcoin cash on Tuesday. But just minutes after opening, Coinbase suspended trades and eventually canceled orders.   The price of bitcoin cash soared to $9,500 as trading began on the Coinbase exchange, GDAX, according to coinmarketcap.com, which tracks transactions. Coinmarketcap placed a red flag on that price and refers to it as ""excluded,"" noting there was an ""outlier detected."" Coinbase does not recognize the $9,500 price on its exchange.   On other exchanges, such as Kraken, bitcoin cash traded at about $3,600 on Wednesday.   Coinbase is a trading site popular with digital currencies like ethereum and litecoin as well as bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency which was trading at about $17,000 on Wednesday. Coinbase tends to drive up prices for cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, when it includes them in its exchange.   The company, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment about the price increase to CNNMoney. Attempts to contact the creators of bitcoin cash were unsuccessful.

255,255,Why you shouldn't add Bitcoin to your retirement portfolio,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/retirement/alternative-investments-retirement/index.html,"Dec 20, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding financial advisers who will encourage you to dramatically broaden your investing palette in the name of diversification, higher returns or both.   I'm also confident those advisers will have no trouble coming up with a long list of alternative investments for you to consider, ranging from the usual suspects like commodities, precious metals, hedge funds, private equity and absolute-return funds to more arcane vehicles like equipment leases, tax lien certificates, structured settlements and fishing rights, to name a few.   Some might even suggest taking a flier on Bitcoin, the wonder investment whose price has soared from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year to almost $20,000 recently (although, who knows, it could have risen or fallen by several thousand dollars in the time it took to read this sentence).   But I'm not part of the ""more is better"" chorus. I'm a ""less is more and simpler is better"" kind of guy. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that once you start expanding your investment horizon beyond a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds (or stock and bond funds or ETFs), you also run the risk of ending up with jumble of investments that are costly and difficult to manage. In short, you may wind up ""di-worse-ifying"" rather than diversifying.   That's not to say that adding a few well-placed alt investments may not be able to better diversify a portfolio while simultaneously boosting its return potential (although, at this point, I wouldn't put any serious money into Bitcoin, given the difficulty of estimating its fundamental value).   Related: How should I invest my retirement savings for safety and income?   But if you hope to improve your portfolio's return without simply ratcheting up risk, you can't just throw more investments into your portfolio willy-nilly. You've got to consider each investment's expected return, figure out how your various investments will interact with one another and determine what percentage of your portfolio's assets each of your investments should represent.   Even for investment pros using sophisticated software, this is no simple task, nor is there any guarantee that the results will come in as projected. I think it's fair to say that most individual investors would have trouble doing all this in a systematic and disciplined way on their own.   Of course, there's no shortage of advisers who will claim that they can skillfully integrate any number of alt investments into your portfolio and manage it so your portfolio performs like a charm. And maybe after doing some research on their track records, you'll be able to identify ones who can actually do so (or at least have managed it in the past). But you'll have to pay them a yearly fee to create and monitor your various holdings. Add that charge to the underlying costs of the investments themselves -- which in many cases can be quite hefty in the case of alt investments -- and the overall costs can seriously erode any potential benefit.   Given the difficulty and the cost of putting together a complicated portfolio and the possibility that it may not perform as well as you hope, I think the vast majority of investors -- by which I mean people who aren't investing tens of millions of dollars or more -- are probably better off just sticking to a broadly diversified portfolio of stock and bond funds or ETFs.   Which brings us back to your situation. You say you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds, but you aren't pleased with the returns you're earning. I find that puzzling. In the nearly nine years since the market hit bottom in the financial crisis, stocks have been going gangbusters. In fact, returns have been so strong -- nearly an annualized 20% since March, 2009 -- that many investment pros are wondering how much longer this bull market can last. And while bonds haven't kept us with stocks' torrid pace, their performance over that time has been respectable, just under 4% a year.   So if you've had anything close to a decent dollop of stocks in your portfolio, I would think you should have enjoyed some pretty decent gains. That makes me wonder whether the reason you're not pleased with your portfolio's performance is that you have unrealistic expectations. If that's the case, you need to re-set them.   Fact is, many investment pros believe returns over the next decade or so will be several percentage points lower than they've been in the past. That's not to say you can't search for investments that will buck the trend. But the potential for higher returns always comes with higher risk. And even if you're okay taking on that heightened risk, there's no guarantee the loftier returns will materialize.   If, on the other hand, the problem isn't with your return expectations and the returns you're earning are actually subpar, then maybe there's something about your portfolio or the way it's being managed that accounts for its anemic performance. Perhaps it's not properly diversified or you're paying too much in costs and fees, or maybe you've lost out on returns by moving your money in and out of the market at inopportune times.   If that's the case, then I'd say the right way to address your dissatisfaction isn't to launch a search for alternative investments, but to re-assess your holdings with the aim of creating a portfolio of stocks and bonds that can actually give you a better shot at reaping whatever gains the market delivers.   Start by determining whether your portfolio is truly diversified. Basically, you want to make sure you have exposure to virtually all sectors of the stock and bond markets. That would mean owning large-, mid- and small-cap stocks as well as growth and value shares and a broad swath of investment-grade bonds, both government and corporate issues.   For even broader diversification, you can also add foreign stocks and bonds, including those of developed and emerging markets. You could build such a broadly diversified portfolio on your own, but it would be much easier to simply invest in a total U.S. stock market stock index fund and total U.S. bond market index fund for domestic exposure and a total international stock index and total international bond index fund for exposure to the rest of the world.   Related: Do you need a managed retirement account?   Next, you'll want to make sure your portfolio reflects your tolerance for risk. Generally, the more you invest in stocks, the greater your portfolio's return potential. But you also want to have enough of your money in bonds so that when the market goes into one of its periodic meltdowns, you'll be able to weather the setback without panicking and selling your stocks when prices are depressed. There's no stocks-bonds mix that's ideal for everyone, but you can get a good idea of what blend may be right for you by completing Vanguard's free risk tolerance-asset allocation questionnaire.   Finally, hold the line on investment fees. I can't say that every dollar you save in costs translates exactly into an extra dollar of return, but Morningstar research shows that fees are the best predictor of fund performance and that funds with low annual charges tend to deliver higher returns than those with more onerous levies. You can search for funds with low fees by going to Morningstar's Fund or ETF screener. Or you can simply stick as much as possible to broad low-cost index funds or ETFs, many of which have annual expenses of less than 0.20%, or well below half the amount many actively managed funds charge.   If after going through the assessment I've outlived above you still feel the need to expand into alternative assets, then at least hold the amount you invest to a small percentage of your overall holdings and try to keep costs down. Otherwise, you may end up writing me again, only next time to ask how to go about restoring order to an unwieldy portfolio that's difficult to manage and expensive to boot. "

The bill now heads back to the House for one more vote before landing on President Trump's desk.   The plan drops the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, nearly doubles the standard deduction for individuals and restructures the way pass-through businesses are taxed.   The bill keeps seven personal income tax brackets. It lowers tax rates for most of the brackets, including dropping the top rate to 37% from 39.6%.   Critics say the bill is heavily weighted to ease the tax burden of businesses rather than the middle class. It has also been criticized for being at odds with international trade laws.   2.

Seoul-based Youbit said it was filing for bankruptcy after cyber-thieves stole nearly a fifth of its clients' holdings in an attack Tuesday.   It's the second time this year that Youbit, which allows customers to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies, has been hit by hackers.   In April, thieves made off with 38 billion won ($35 million) in digital currencies. The company didn't say how much was taken in the latest heist or how exactly it happened.   Related: What is bitcoin?   South Korea's Korea Internet and Security Agency said Wednesday that it was working with police to investigate this week's Youbit hack, but that it didn't yet know who was responsible.   Youbit said that its customers would get back about three-quarters of the value of the digital currencies they had stored in accounts with the exchange. The rest will be refunded after bankruptcy proceedings, it said.   Bitcoin's history is littered with cases of trading platforms coming under attack.   Earlier this month, hackers stole more than $70 million worth of bitcoins from digital currency platform Nicehash. Last year, Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex was briefly shut down after hackers stole more than $60 million in bitcoins.   Related: More than $70 million stolen in bitcoin hack   Tim Wellsmore, director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm FireEye, said bitcoin exchanges had been slow to respond to the threats posed by hackers.   ""As the prices of bitcoin and similar virtual currencies continue to appreciate, we expect greater interest from attackers seeking to steal it,"" he said.   Bitcoin's price (XBT) is now more than 15 times as high as it was at the start of the year.  This is a modal window.   Suspicion for this week's Youbit hack could fall on North Korea.   South Korean police have accused North Korean hackers of targeting at least four different exchanges this year that trade bitcoin and other digital currencies in South Korea.

The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading Tuesday of The Crypto Company until January 3, citing ""concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information"" about compensation paid to promote the firm and plans for insider sales.   The Crytpo Company describes itself as a business that ""offers a portfolio of digital assets, technologies, and consulting services to the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets"" with plans for a ""rollout of a full scale, high frequency cryptocurrency trading floor.""   Shares of The Crypto Company (CRCW) have surged nearly 160% in the past five days, more than 1,800% in the past month and 17,000% in the past three months, as investors and traders have bid up the price of bitcoin (XBT) higher and higher.   That stunning rise has lifted the company's market value to more than $11 billion. To put that in perspective, that's higher than the market value of well-known brand name companies like Macy's (M), The New York Times (NYT) and Under Armour (UAA).   Related: Regulators worried about bitcoin euphoria   The SEC move comes shortly after The Crypto Company announced plans to split its stock 10-1 to try and push the price lower and make it more affordable for average investors.   Shares had surged to a price of $575 before the SEC suspended trading. A 10-1 split would have increased the number of total shares by a factor of ten and lowered the price to $57.50. So the value of the company would not have changed.   The Crypto Company CEO Mike Poutre said in a release about the split that the company wanted to ""see orderly market activity"" for the stock and added that the split was ""the responsible thing to do.""   He noted that many blue chip companies, including MasterCard (MA) and Apple (AAPL), have done stock splits to keep their prices more accessible to mom and pop investors.   Poutre also referred to ""the euphoria"" surrounding bitcoin, and added that ""we want people to pay attention to the business we are building, not the hype of a stock or the cryptocurrency world.""   The Crypto Company was not immediately available for comment about the SEC action.   But the SEC has taken steps lately to crack down on potential frauds and scams surrounding bitcoin and other digital currencies, particularly with initial coin offerings or ICOs. With an ICO, a company sells a digital currency or token to investors instead of stock.   Several cryptocurrency executives are nervous about the industry getting a bad reputation too.   Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, a company that developed the Ripple XRP cryptocurrency and also works to license blockchain technology with banks, says he wants to cooperate with agencies like the SEC to weed out bad actors.   ""Many of the ICOs are more frauds than real businesses. The industry needs to work with regulators and not be in the shadows,"" he said. ""ICOs are taking advantage of grey areas in securities law. What worries me the most is some of the hype in the system.""

She said that there is ""a lot of speculation"" in the crypto area and that she ""welcomes scrutiny from the SEC.""   Still, there are signs that investors aren't listening to these warnings.   Another small financial tech company that just went public called LongFin (LFIN) has skyrocketed from a low of $4.69 a share in the past week to a high of $142.82 after it announced it was buying a blockchain microlending company named Ziddu.com   And then there's Riot Blockchain (RIOT), a company that up until recently was a biotech firm and has decided to get into the crypto business. Its stock is up more than 300% in the past month and 1,200% this year.   Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, wrote in a report that this reminded him clearly of the dotcom and tech stock mania of the late 1990s. That did not end well for investors chasing the most speculative of stocks.   O'Rourke pointed out that one widely hyped business-to-business software company called Commerce One went public in 1999 at $21 a share and surged to around $1,000 by the end of the year. Commerce One filed for bankruptcy five years later.   Now this is not to say that bitcoin itself is a bubble. There is a real trend towards digital payments using blockchain technology.

Amtrak crash At least three people are dead and more than 100 others injured after an Amtrak train derailed yesterday in Washington state. The train was on its first trip on a new route between Seattle and Portland when 13 of its cars jumped the track. Several of them fell from an overpass onto a busy interstate highway. None of the reported fatalities involved people on the highway. Positive train control -- which uses GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding, derailing or speeding --  was not activated at the time of the crash, a rail line spokesman said.  The train reportedly was traveling 80 mph in a 30-mph zone, which will be one of the main details investigators will look at in the coming days. They may also look at the so-called black box, or event data recorder, to get more information about the train's braking and other operational details. The federal go-team will also interview the engineer, conductor and the other three crew members. 2. Trump nominee Matthew Petersen, President Donald Trump's district court nominee, has withdrawn his nomination just days after his bizarre confirmation hearing went viral. In a video of the hearing, Petersen, who now serves as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, was peppered with questions about how many depositions he had worked on, how many jury trials he had tried and the last time he had read the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It's safe to say, he had a bit of a hard time landing the answers. In a letter to the President, Petersen said the hearing amounted to ""my worst two minutes on television."" 3. Austria Austria's new coalition government, which includes the far-right Freedom Party, was sworn in yesterday amid protests. Though the Freedom Party will argue it has modernized, it was founded in the 1950s by actual former Nazis. Also raising some eyebrows is the country's new Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. He is the leader of the center-right People's Party and, at 31, is the youngest major leader in the world. Protesters shouted in the streets, bearing signs with pleas like, ""Don't let Nazis govern."" 4. Libya British lawmakers used a debate yesterday to express their outrage at the revelations about the slave trade in Libya exposed by a CNN report last month. One member of Parliament described the crimes as ""violations of human rights and human dignity that are on an unthinkable scale."" Video footage released last month shows migrants being sold into slavery in the north African country, some for as little as $400 each. Another MP called the crimes depicted in the video ""atrocious,"" acknowledging that ""nobody really knows the extent of the problem."" He argued that the power vacuum in Libya and the root causes of migration need to be addressed before any solutions can be found. 5. ESPN ESPN staffers and personalities around the world of sports are reeling after the surprise resignation of ESPN President John Skipper. Skipper resigned on Monday, citing a substance addiction. ""I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,"" Skipper said in a statement. ""I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem."" According to an ESPN source, the announcement was solely because of addiction and was unrelated to last week's announcement that Disney would acquire most of 21st Century Fox.

260,260,Overstock is turning into a bitcoin tech company,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/news/companies/overstock-ico-ceo-byrne/index.html,"Dec 18, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Well, bigger than he already has.   Patrick Byrne, who runs Overstock.com (OSTBP), an online retailer that competes with Amazon (AMZN), is launching a $250 million Initial Coin Offering on December 18 to raise funds to reshape the business. That figure would just about match the largest ICO to date.   The company is one of the first retailers to accept bitcoin and will make the coin offering through its exchange, tZero. Its stock has tracked closely to bitcoin's wild rise -- Overstock's stock rose 4-fold between July and December as bitcoin grew more than 7-fold.   So maybe it's no surprise that Byrne is considering going in whole-cloth on cryptocurrencies.   Byrne told CNNMoney he wants to possibly sell off the retail business and focus on Overstock's ownership of 10 blockchain companies -- the technology behind cryptocurrency -- through its venture capital subsidiary, Medici Ventures. He has also formed a joint venture with Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto called De Soto, Inc., a company that would use blockchain technology to form a property registry providing land rights to people in the developing world.   Overstock's move comes at a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission is ramping up its scrutiny of the fast-growing, multi-billion dollar ICO industry. But that doesn't worry Byrne.   ""I'm actually quite supportive of the SEC cracking down,"" said Byrne in an interview with CNNMoney. ""The ICO craze this year has led to a lot of people being fleeced. There's been a lot of people bringing coins public with no business plan.""   Related: Bitcoin: What's driving the frenzy?   ICOs have raised a total of $4 billion in 2017, according to Autonomous Research, a financial research company in London. That's compared to $226 million in 2016, and to $14 million in the year of their inception, 2014.   This one could be among the biggest crowdsales to use digital currency. A crowdsale is crowdfunding for ICOs.   ""Overstock would be the largest existing company to launch an ICO to date,"" said Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge who studies cryptocurrency.   Garrick said the biggest ICO was from Filecoin, a storage data network that raised about $250 million, also in September.   ""Blockchain is going to change the world more, I think, than the internet has,"" said Byrne, who believes that many people will gradually abandon government-backed currencies if more countries encounter currency failures like in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.   Digital currencies are far from universally accepted. Earlier this month, the SEC shut down one ICO and froze the assets of another, while warning investors about the lack of regulation and protection.   The top cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has been trading at stratospheric heights, recently peaking at more than $18,000 on some exchanges.

The index has nearly quadrupled since the financial crisis low, with most of the gains occurring prior to Trump's election.   U.S. stock futures were pointing higher on Monday.   2. Bitcoin futures: CME, the derivatives marketplace, kicked off electronic bitcoin futures trading on Sunday, a week after futures trading began on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.   Investors see the involvement of top financial institutions as a sign of growing mainstream acceptance -- even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn against investing in it.   The digital currency is still extremely volatile. It jumped to within a few hundred dollars of the $20,000 mark on Sunday before slipping back sharply. By early Monday, it was trading well below $19,000.   3. Brexit decisions: What kind of relationship does Britain want with the EU, its biggest export market?   Prime Minister Theresa May will discuss the vital question with cabinet members on Monday. There are two camps: Those who want to negotiate continued easy access to EU markets, and those who want to break free from EU regulation even if it means accepting new barriers to trade.   Both scenarios come with risks and consequences that are likely to upset factions within May's Conservative party.   The pound edged up to trade above $1.33.   4.

262,262,Bitcoin futures trading just got a lot bigger,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/investing/bitcoin-cme-futures/index.html,"Dec 18, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The red hot digital currency hit new highs over the weekend -- and it's now got the weight of the world's biggest exchange operator behind it.   Financial market giant CME Group (CME) launched bitcoin futures trading on Sunday evening in the U.S., a week after a similar move by its smaller rival Cboe Global Markets (CBOE).   The involvement of top financial institutions in the bitcoin market underscores its growing mainstream acceptance even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn people against investing in it.   Related: What is bitcoin?   The CME launch ""adds considerable legitimacy"" to bitcoin trading, said Shane Chanel, an adviser at Australian investment services firm ASR Wealth Advisers.   Bitcoin's price (XBT) hit a record high earlier Sunday before the futures trading started on CME. It climbed to within a few hundred dollars of the $20,000 mark before slipping back. By early Monday, it was trading around $19,000.   Investors were betting it will go higher. The January futures price on CME was about $19,500 Monday morning, down from an earlier high of $20,650.   Futures are contracts that let investors buy or sell something at a specific price in the future. But unlike traditional commodities such as oil or agricultural products, bitcoins aren't physical assets. And unlike traditional currencies, there isn't a central bank that backs bitcoin. The virtual coins are created on computers using complex algorithms and recorded in a digital ledger.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned   Bitcoin has had an incredible year. Its price has skyrocketed more than 1,700% since the start of January, partly on the expectation that more and more mainstream investors will begin trading it.   That's prompted some high-profile figures in finance and economics to sound the alarm, cautioning that the currency's boom is simply a huge, speculative bubble.   But their warnings contrast with moves like those of CME and and Cboe to start bitcoin futures trading.  This is a modal window.     CME is home to about three times as much trading per day than Cboe. With CME's futures contracts, investors have to trade bitcoin in blocks of five, versus just one at a time with Cboe.   The two also price their bitcoin contracts in different ways. Cboe bases its price on one exchange, Gemini, whereas CME takes an average from multiple exchanges.   ASR's Chanel said that the launch of futures on CME should eventually help iron out some of the wild gyrations in the price of bitcoin.   Related: Bitcoin vs history's biggest bubbles: They never end well   And more big names in finance are also planning to get involved.   New York's Nasdaq is expected to launch its own bitcoin futures trading sometime next year.

Next up: Dow 25,000. It could happen any day now, especially if Congress passes the massive package of tax cuts that has seriously fired up Wall Street.   Whenever the Dow tops 25,000, it'll be an incredible feat. Not just because it's another milestone in a year of milestones (Dow 20,000; 21,000; 22,000; 23,000; and only three weeks ago 24,000), but because it shows just how far the stock market has come from the crisis.   Consider that the Dow crashed to just 6,443 in March 2009 during the Great Recession. The world's most famous market barometer has nearly quadrupled from that crisis low, with most of the gains occurring prior to President Trump's election.   There's no question that Trump's promises of tax cuts and deregulation has lit a fuse under the stock market. But the market would likely be up a bunch even without Trump's stimulus agenda.   That's because economies are strong, in the United States and around the world. The good times mean record-high profits should be able to keep going, even without the windfall that would come from the tax overhaul that the GOP is on the verge of enacting.   No wonder the business community is euphoric. Confidence among small businesses, manufacturers, homebuilders and consumers is the strongest in aggregate since the early 1980s, according to a recent report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That optimism is ""consistent with 5-6%"" GDP growth, the firm said.   That's why BofA is calling for the S&P 500 to race to 2,863 in the first quarter. That would be a 7% advance from already elevated levels.   But could the post-election surge then finally mellow out? BofA is warning that early 2018 will likely bring a ""Big Top in risk assets"" (read: stocks and junk bonds), especially if inflation finally rears its ugly head.   ""Excess bullishness won't take long,"" BofA concluded.   2. And here come the tax votes: House and Senate Republicans are on track to deliver a tax reform plan to Trump by Christmas.   GOP leaders agreed on the final text of the bill last week and revealed it to the public on Friday. The House will go first: It's expected to vote on Tuesday, and the Senate will follow soon after. Then it will go to the president's desk.   Related: What's in the GOP's final tax plan   The plan, which has been rushing through Congress, has been criticized by some experts -- including outgoing Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. During her final press conference, Yellen warned last week that the deficits the bill will bring -- about $1.46 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation -- could make it harder to fight a future recession.   Related: Janet Yellen: Tax plan's deficits could make it harder to fight a recession   The bill drops the corporate tax rate down from 35% to 21%, repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and restructures the way pass-through businesses are taxed.   3. Consumer brands report earnings: Americans are spending. Retail sales rose 0.8% in November, confounding expectations and showing that U.S. shoppers aren't cutting back this holiday season. That's good news for the consumer brands that report earnings in the coming week -- most of which could use a boost.   Related: News flash! U.S. economy already looks strong   Shares of FedEx (FDX), which plans to report on Tuesday, dipped in October following news that Amazon (AMZN) may launch its own delivery service.

And North American sales for Nike (NKE), scheduled to announce earnings on Thursday, fell by 3% last quarter compared with 2016.   4. Bitcoin trading kicks off on CME: CME, the derivatives marketplace, kicks off electronic bitcoin futures trading on Sunday, a week after futures trading began on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

264,264,Twitter is soaring as takeover talk resurfaces,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/15/investing/twitter-goldman-sachs-lloyd-blankfein-jack-dorsey-takeover-rumors/index.html,"Dec 15, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Blankfein tweeted a picture of himself with Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey Wednesday along with the following joke: ""And they say I don't know jack!""   Blankfein was at Twitter headquarters to be interviewed by Dorsey. But since that tweet, there has been increased chatter about whether Twitter might be considering putting itself up for sale -- and if Goldman Sachs (GS) would be its merger advisor.   Twitter shares have surged more than 6% this week and are up nearly 40% this year -- despite the fact that many analysts remain concerned about slowing user growth, the lack of profitability and increased competition from Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP).   So the merger speculation makes sense. Some have suggested that Twitter would be better off as the part of a larger company.  And they say I don't know jack! pic.twitter.com/RkKgJdjnb0  There has been frequent chatter about whether Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) would want to buy it, especially since former Google executive Omid Kordestani left Google to become Twitter's executive chairman in October 2015.   Disney (DIS) was reportedly looking at Twitter last year as well, and Goldman Sachs was said to be advising Twitter at the time.   Apple (AAPL) and cloud software firm Salesforce (CRM), run by frequent tweeter Marc Benioff, have also been cited as possible Twitter acquirers.   There's also the argument that Dorsey would be better off giving up control of Twitter so he can focus even more on the other company he runs -- mobile payments firm Square.   Shares of Square (SQ) have soared nearly 175% this year and a recent rally has been fueled by the fact that Square has started to let users of its Cash app buy and sell bitcoin.   Flash forward to this week. Disney just bought a big chunk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA). And that has reignited talk of more consolidation throughout the media world, including social media companies like Twitter.   Related: Trump talked to Rupert Murdoch about Disney deal   A Twitter spokesperson said the company does not comment on rumors but added that Blankfein was at Twitter headquarters ""to speak to Twitter employees about leadership and his use of Twitter.""   ""We have a wide range of guests who come speak to our employees as part of a larger Q&A series with well known Twitter users,"" the spokesperson added.   Goldman Sachs had no comment.   Still, there are some reasons to be bullish on Twitter that have nothing to do with a possible takeover.   Some hope that engagement -- and hence, advertising revenue -- may increase now that Twitter has doubled its character count to 280.   Related: The case against 280-character tweets   There was some initial skepticism about the change, but that has largely died down. In fact, even Blankfein seems to be a fan after showing some reservations at first.   Blankfein tweeted on November 7 that he likes ""the discipline of 140. Makes you commit. No room for ""on the other hand...."" #280characters is practically an essay!"" That tweet took up just 137 characters.   But he quickly changed his tune, writing in a 173 character tweet on November 20 that ""I'm using up to #280characters now because the room is there. Just like I know the 140 calorie yogurt is better for me but can't resist the 280 calorie cake if it's there.""  New at this but like the discipline of 140. Makes you commit. No room for ""on the other hand...."" #280characters is practically an essay! I'm using up to #280characters now because the room is there. Just like I know the 140 calorie yogurt is better for me but can't resist the 280 calorie cake if it's there. https://t.co/TdqhZEVg1J  Twitter also has a new partnership with news organization Bloomberg that is set to launch Monday. Bloomberg will debut a 24 hours/7 days a week social news network on Monday called TicToc that will stream live on Twitter.   This is just the latest effort by Twitter to show Wall Street that the service is not just about the famous people using Twitter, such as President Trump, but that it can also be a viable platform for live news and sports programming.   In addition to the deal with Bloomberg, Twitter also has live video deals with BuzzFeed, streaming financial news network Cheddar, Major League Baseball and golf's PGA Tour.   The jury is still out though as to whether or not Twitter will still be an independent company at this time a year from now. A lot of that will depend on whether Twitter's new video efforts can really boost user growth, ad sales and profits.   But that's probably something Blankfein and Dorsey will talk about in private as opposed to sharing those thoughts with Blankfein's 75,000 followers and Dorsey's more than 4 million devotees. "

As the U.S. economy picks up speed, with low unemployment and rising consumer confidence, some of you have written to me criticizing that we are not giving enough credit to President Trump for this economic nirvana.   There is a good reason: According to most private economists, this is not yet Donald Trump's economy. The landscape we are currently enjoying is the handiwork of Janet Yellen's Federal Reserve and Barack Obama's White House.   Those who write to me don't agree. Their argument is that companies are bringing back investment, creating new jobs and there is new confidence because of the prospects of lower taxes, massive deregulation and stronger trade protections for American companies. In other words, President Trump has created this environment and he deserves the credit for its benefits.   Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox   I can see the merit of this argument. Unfortunately, most private sector economists, like Professor Ken Rogoff at Harvard, a former chief economist at the IMF, don't agree with it. Time and again, these economists say, yes, Trump has had an effect, but it's too soon to give him full credit.   The debate will continue. I won't take sides. Instead, we will just bring you both arguments, allowing you to make up your own mind. Anytime you want to write to me, my email address is below.        Disney's purchase of the movie studio assets of 21st Century Fox makes Disney a more formidable player in Hollywood.   It gives Disney the rights to Marvel characters such as the X-Men that Fox owned. It will boost the chances of success for the Disney and Fox-backed Hulu and Disney's own streaming service that it plans to launch to fight Netflix.   But Disney may inherit a mess in Europe as Fox tries to buy Sky. The deal may also complicate the legacy of Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch while bolstering the reputation of Disney CEO Bob Iger.   Prophetically enough, Fox's ""The Simpsons"" predicted a deal in 1998.   -- Paul R. La Monica        In a move that surprised nobody, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time this year Wednesday.   It's a sign of a healthy economy, which was further confirmed Thursday after the government reported a drop in the number of people filing for unemployment claims and strong retail sales for November.   Still, outgoing Fed chair Janet Yellen warned that President Trump's tax plan will boost the deficit and could make it tougher for her planned successor Jerome Powell to deal with future crises.   Yellen also urged people to be careful when buying bitcoin, which she referred to as ""a highly speculative asset.""   -- Paul R. La Monica        Bitcoin mania continues to heat up.   In just the past week, bitcoin futures launched and regulators warned investors to be wary. Kim Jong Un could be making a fortune on the boom because North Korea has recently been ""mining"" bitcoin, stealing it and demanding it as ransom payment.   Bitcoin has really taken off in South Korea, where trading has gone mainstream.   One threat to bitcoin -- something newer that could replace it. With that in mind, keep an eye on litecoin, the smaller cryptocurrency that has surged by more than bitcoin over the past month.   -- Matt Egan        A top U.K. ethics panel said Wednesday that Facebook, Twitter and Google should take ""more responsibility"" for illegal content on their platforms. The Committee on Standards in Public Life, which advises Prime Minister Theresa May, said the situation calls for new legislation.   Meanwhile, the head of a parliamentary committee investigating the role of fake news and online misinformation in the U.K. said Wednesday that Facebook needed to look harder for Russian meddling before the Brexit vote. Facebook said a Russian troll farm that spent $100,000 in the U.S. had spent only $0.97 in Britain.   -- Julia Horowitz      The fight for the future of the internet: What the end of net neutrality means   Get the popcorn ready!

266,266,What's the Treasury doing about bitcoin? A senator wants to know,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/14/news/economy/senator-treasury-bitcoin/index.html,"Dec 14, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Senator Ron Wyden sent his questions in a letter to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on Thursday.   FinCEN, as the unit is called, tracks money laundering and uses sensitive U.S. government intelligence to spy on illicit banking worldwide.   CNN received an early copy of the letter. In it the senator says he worries the computerized currency ""could be laundered through trades that occur outside the regulatory framework that applies to current financial transactions.""   Wyden is asking asked FinCEN to explain its ""authority and capabilities to identify the... owners of virtual currencies,"" as well as its ability to ""trace and seize"" this digital money.   FinCEN declined to comment to CNN about the letter Thursday morning. But the agency pointed to a previous statement by acting director Jamal El-Hindi that said: ""We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. anti-money laundering laws.""   Related: Fed chair calls bitcoin 'highly speculative'   Bitcoin (and other digital currencies like it) are independent, self-sustaining and not backed by any government. They do not identify users by name. And Bitcoin's groundbreaking technology for tracking transactions, a concept called the ""blockchain,"" is quickly gaining recognition. Blockchain is the innovative way bitcoin creates new units of currency and keeps a decentralized, public, and secure record of all transactions.   The value of a bitcoin has skyrocketed from $900 to more than $16,000 on some exchanges this year. And while it was already a preferred online currency for hackers and criminals, that rise in price has drawn additional attention from the underworld.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Hackers tied to the North Korean regime have been caught infecting computers and demanding bitcoin as ransom payments. Bitfinex, the world's largest online market for bitcoins, and several other website exchanges have been hit by cyberattacks seeking to steal bitcoin accounts.   ""I believe that we should look to support financial innovation, but that we should ensure new technology companies comply with existing [anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing] laws,"" Wyden wrote.   Related: Regulators on bitcoin: buyer beware   It's unclear what effect this news could have on the bitcoin market. Since its inception, interest in bitcoin has been largely limited to techno-libertarians who view it as an alternative to state-controlled inflationary currencies. To them, the specter of government regulation is viewed negatively. Whenever a government has moved to regulate or ban bitcoin, and fears have temporarily pushed down prices sharply.   But current interest by major banks and industry into bitcoin's core technology could hold that back, as they welcome regulation that legitimizes this mysterious and volatile technological experiment.   FinCEN has taken some action on bitcoin in the past.   In 2016, it warned financial companies in the bitcoin exchange business that they're still required to follow the same ""know your customer"" and anti-money laundering rules as banks. It followed that up in July with its first major legal action against a ""money services business,"" hitting the internet-based BTC-e exchange with a $110 million civil penalty for ignoring those rules.   The senator expressed concern that Russia and Venezuela view digital currency as a way to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions put in place to punish them for their violent authoritarian behavior.   Earlier this month Venezuela announced plans to launch its own digital currency, dubbed ""the Petro"" and backed by the nation's oil and gas, to specifically evade the blockade.   ""While this is unlikely to be a credible plot to evade U.S. sanctions, it is an example of how this promising new technology could be used for nefarious purposes,"" Wyden said in his letter.   Wyden also asked FinCEN how it monitors a related phenomenon: the sudden rise of ""initial coin offerings,"" in which startups are offering digital currencies in a sometimes dubious attempt to raise investor money.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned the public about the potential for ""ICO scams,"" and this week regulators stopped food review app Munchee from raising $15 million this way.   The senator's letter, addressed to acting FinCEN director El-Hindi, asked for a public response by Dec. 29.

Google's annual list of the most popular searches is here, offering a peek into what people are really thinking about. Like 2017 itself, this year's top searches skew a little darker than usual, but are punctuated with some whimsy and positive moments.   The top trending searches in the U.S. were Irma, Matt Lauer, Tom Petty, the Super Bowl and the Las Vegas shooting.   To determine the most popular trending searches, Google looked at its trillions of queries, filtered out spam and repeats, and identified searches that had the highest uptick in traffic compared with the previous year. It breaks them into categories like news, memes, and recipes (beef stroganoff was a hit).   Related: The most downloaded iOS apps of 2017   While ""#metoo"" didn't show up on the lists, the movement's impact certainly did.   High profile men who have been accused of sexual misconduct were among the most searched for people in the U.S., including Lauer, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Bill O'Reilly.   Lauer topped global searches, as well, and Louis C.K. was one of the most searched for actors.      Donald Trump isn't anywhere to be found on Google's lists, but that's because he was just as searched for last year and therefore not ""trending.""   Politics were everywhere, though. Among the top ""What is ...?"" searches were DACA, antifa, net neutrality, covfefe and the Paris Climate Agreement. France had the most googled election, followed by Germany and the U.K.     Google also broke out the most searched for protests in the U.S. The top query was the NFL national anthem protests, followed by Charlottesville.   Money was on everyone's mind. People wanted to know what bitcoin is, how to buy it, and the latest bitcoin price. They also asked how to freeze their credit, a common concern after the year's enormous Equifax hack.   Related: Google's new photo apps   There was plenty of joy, too.   The solar eclipse trended in multiple categories. People wanted to know how to make their own slime and how many calories were in Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino (410 in a Grande). April the giraffe was the ninth most popular news story in the U.S.      Meghan Markle, the American actor who got engaged to Prince Harry, was a popular search topic. In addition to being the second most searched for person and first most searched for actor, she also made an appearance on the celebrity hair list.  This is a modal window.     To the surprise of no one with a radio, ""Despacito"" was the most searched for song. The Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee hit was also the most watched music video of the year on YouTube. And like astronaut Scott Kelly, many Google users were looking up Cardi B. and her hit Bodak Yellow.   Intriguingly, the iPhone 8 was more searched for than the iPhone X. Apple's newest devices were the most popular consumer tech searches of the year, followed by the Nintendo Switch and the Samsung Galaxy S8.   Related: The top tweeted political account in 2017 was @realDonaldTrump and the top hashtag was #resist   The most googled movie was ""It,"" Stephen King's horror classic about a menacing killer clown.   The Netflix show ""13 Reasons Why"" was a top TV show search in the U.S. and around the world, and sixth most popular overall search globally, likely because of controversy over the show's depiction of teen suicide.      People also turned to Google for help with their love lives.   According to the list of top relationship questions, they wanted to know how to make long distance relationships work, how to change their Facebook status, what it meant to be polyamorous or in an open relationship, and how to know when it's all over.   Google users weren't just worried about their own relationships. The top celebrity breakup search was for Bachelor stars Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell.

In recent months, experts and officials say North Korea has been ""mining"" bitcoin, demanding it as ransom payment and outright stealing the digital currency.    ""It is a fact that North Korea has been attacking virtual currency exchanges,"" said Lee Dong-geun, a director with South Korea's state-run Korea Internet and Security Agency. ""We don't know how much North Korea has stolen so far, but we do know that the police have confirmed the regime's hacking attempts.""   Related: What is bitcoin?   North Korean hackers targeted four different exchanges that trade bitcoin and other digital currencies in South Korea in July and August, sending malicious emails to employees, according to police.   Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency that lives on computer servers. The virtual coins are ""mined"" by complex algorithms and recorded in a digital ledger.   Experts say it's unclear how much bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies North Korea has amassed.   ""It's reasonable to assume some -- and the value is increasing significantly at the moment,"" said Bryce Boland, Asia-Pacific chief technology officer for cybersecurity firm FireEye.   Related: Bitcoin rally continues as futures forecast even higher prices   Experts say the attacks are likely to continue as bitcoin's price skyrockets. It started the year below $1,000 but has soared more than 1,500%, crossing $17,000 for the first time last week.   It's not just bitcoin's dizzying gains that make it appealing to North Korea.   The digital currency was designed to operate outside of the control of governments or banks. That's likely to appeal to North Korea at a time when the U.S. is stepping up efforts to cut the country out of the international financial system over its nuclear weapons program.     It has also proved popular in the past with criminals because of the amount of anonymity it allows. Bitcoin isn't tied to any central bank, and payments can be made anonymously without using banks as middlemen.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   That could help North Korea convert its stash into money it can more easily use.   Bitcoins are often held in accounts with online exchanges. But Boland points out that hackers can easily swap them into more obscure cryptocurrencies, move them to other exchanges and eventually withdraw them in traditional currencies like dollars.   ""They could do those transactions very quickly ... and avoid traceability of the cash,"" Boland said.  This is a modal window.     North Korea has repeatedly denied involvement in international hacking attacks. But it has made no secret of its interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   Last month, the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology touted a lecture from a bitcoin expert who came to North Korea to teach students about the technology behind the digital currency. The university is a high-profile institution where scions of the North Korean elite study.   ""Many excellent technical questions were asked about the inner working of bitcoin, its risks, and the measures taken to ensure security,"" the university said.   Related: More than $70 million stolen in bitcoin hack   Boland said FireEye believes North Korea is ""developing a significant number of people who understand bitcoin so they can expand their operations.""   That's likely to mean more attacks on exchanges and other cryptocurrency targets.   -- Taehoon Lee contributed to this report. "
271,271,Looking to sell bitcoin? It's complicated,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/12/technology/how-to-sell-bitcoin/index.html,"Dec 12, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   On Monday, a little more than a week after buying $100 worth of bitcoin to distract myself at an airport, I decided I'd had enough. Every hour, both day and night, brought wild price fluctuations.   A friend strongly warned me to move my bitcoin to an alternative digital wallet to avoid being hacked after publishing an article about my holdings. And the sage advice of my two investment gurus -- Warren Buffett and my wife -- continued to ring in my ear: ""stay away.""   But the only thing more nerve-racking than buying bitcoin right now may be trying to get your money out.   The same surge in demand for bitcoin that has caused the price to spike from $1,000 at the start of this year to more than $17,000 this week has also put a strain on various bitcoin exchanges, causing sudden outages.   I experienced this firsthand on Monday when using Coinbase, a leading service for trading bitcoin. The exchange suffered a brief crash just as I was gearing up to sell.   Coinbase reminded its users of this risk last week on the day it became the most popular app in the U.S. ""Access to Coinbase services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume,"" the startup wrote in a cautionary blog post. ""This could result in the inability to buy or sell for periods of time.""   Worse still: the skyrocketing price and interest in bitcoin has made it a greater target for attacks. Bitfinex, another large bitcoin exchange, said Tuesday it was trying to deal with a ""heavy DDOS"" attack.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned   Even when the exchanges are functioning properly, selling can be stressful.   Once Coinbase recovered from its outage, I watched as the price shot up above $17,000, approaching a new high. I took that as a sign to sell. But actually submitting the transaction can feel like rolling the dice. Wait 30 seconds (or if the app is simply slow to load) and the price may rise or fall hundreds of dollars.   For those who own large sums of bitcoin, there's an added complication: Services like Coinbase impose varying weekly buy and sell limits to protect accounts. But the limits, which can be as low as $2,500, may make it hard to dump all your holdings at once.     Or as the company put it in the blog post last week, ""Due to the rapidly changing price of digital currencies, some customers may not have sell limits that are sufficient relative to the value of total digital currency they are storing on Coinbase.""   And then there are the delays. Several days after I bought the original $100 worth of bitcoin, I purchased another $150 worth before deciding to put an end to my brief life as a bitcoin trader. It took a full week for the first transaction to go through. The second transaction is still pending.   Put another way: If the price of bitcoin were to plunge 50% this afternoon and I wanted to sell, I would be unable to sell the second batch I'd purchased because technically I still don't have it.   As for that original $100, I ended up netting about $50 in profit after various fees for buying and selling. When that money finally hits my bank account on Friday, I intend to take my wife out to a dinner to make up to her for all the bitcoin talk this month. "
272,272,Regulators on Bitcoin and other digital currencies: Investors beware,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/12/investing/bitcoin-regulators-warning-risk/index.html,"Dec 12, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   As investors rushed to amass Bitcoins this week, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman Christopher Giancarlo reissued similar cautionary messages to Main Street investors and those who advise them: Buyer beware.   ""If a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost,"" said Clayton in a statement after U.S. markets closed on Monday.   Related: Bitcoin vs history's biggest bubbles: They never end well   Clayton spelled out his concerns over cryptocurrencies and so-called initial coin offerings. Startups sometimes raise money by selling virtual currency in exchange for a stake in the company. They are also sometimes redeemed for future services.   But to avoid getting duped he reminded investors that not a single initial coin offering had been registered with the SEC. Nor had the agency approved any listing and trading of any exchanged-trade products holding digital currencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.   ""If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary,"" said Clayton.   The CFTC's Giancarlo quickly endorsed Clayton's statement Monday evening, while also issuing his own advice to investors.   ""Virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC,"" Giancarlo said. ""Investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in these markets.""   The alerts came less than a day after the first Bitcoin futures began trading on an exchange run by Cboe Global Markets Inc. Its larger rival CME Group Inc. will introduce its own Bitcoin futures next week.   Related: Bitcoin: What's driving the frenzy?   The price of Bitcoin soared to $17,478 in futures trading on the Cboe market on Tuesday. A year ago, one Bitcoin was worth less than $1,000.   Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's regulatory czar, stepped up his concerns last month over the virtual currency's price run-up.   ""While these digital currencies may not pose major concerns at their current levels of use, more serious financial stability issues may result if they achieve wide scale usage,"" he said during a speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland conference.   Earlier this month, the two exchanges cleared a regulatory hurdle with the CFTC after ""extensive discussions,"" which included making significant changes to their proposals on how to reduce potential market manipulation.   Futures are a way for traders to bet on whether the price of a commodity, such as oil or gold, will rise or fall. Having a futures contract provides retail investors with an easier way to trade Bitcoin. It also allows Wall Street banks and trading firms to protect themselves against price swings in digital currency.   Despite the CFTC's approval of the deal, Giancarlo has repeatedly said it does not equal an endorsement of the product. He's also warned investors that the ""underlying cash markets and exchanges for Bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets"" which the agency has ""limited statutory authority"" over.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin: Here's what I learned   It's not the first time the agencies have raised red flags over cryptocurrencies. Each agency has issued investor alerts, bulletins and statements on initial coin offerings and digital currency investments.   And while the SEC doesn't regulate Bitcoin per se, it has flexed its muscles on initial coin offerings.   Several start ups have used the tokens to raise money. Earlier Monday, the agency shut down plans by a food review site, Munchee, that was trying to raise $15 million in a digital coin offering to improve its app.   While the SEC chairman didn't completely shut the door on investing in such innovative products, he urged Main Street investors to ask the right questions before taking the leap.   ""Who is issuing and sponsoring the product, what are their backgrounds, and have they provided a full and complete description of the product? Do they have a clear written business plan that I understand? What specific rights come with my investment?"" Clayton suggested as part of more than a dozen questions investors should ask before making any Bitcoin investment. "

It's called litecoin, and it has nearly doubled in just the past 24 hours and has surged more than 250% in the past week according to digital currency brokerage site Coinbase. Bitcoin, by way of comparison, is up ""only"" about 45% in the past week.   Litecoin is on an even crazier tear over the past month and year, skyrocketing more than 500% in the past 30 days and 10,000% in the past 12 months. (Prices change so fast though that these figures may be woefully out of date by the time you read this!)   Litecoin is one of several alternative cryptocurrencies that have cropped up to rival bitcoin. Ethereum, ripple and dash are some others.   Litecoin is much smaller though. The combined value of all the litecoins in circulation is about $18 billion, compared with nearly $300 billion for bitcoin. It is also created, or mined, by people solving complex mathematical puzzles on computers.   You don't have to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to buy them though. Coinbase and other brokerage sites let you set up an account to buy and sell virtual currencies. Mobile payments company Square is testing bitcoin purchases on its Cash app too.   Litecoin, founded by former Google engineer and former director of Coinbase Charlie Lee, is said to be faster and cheaper to mine than bitcoin.   Lee, amusingly enough, goes by the name of @SatoshiLite on Twitter -- a reference to Satoshi Nakamoto, the nickname used by the still anonymous inventor of bitcoin.   Related: South Korea is going bitcoin crazy...   There are rampant rumors about who Nakamoto might be. Some think it's a group of people. There was even speculation recently that Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk is actually Satoshi Nakamoto. Musk has denied it.   But no matter who created bitcoin and launched the crypto revolution, it is clear that investors can't get enough of virtual currencies.   Some experts are nervous that this can't end well though, and that bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies are a bubble destined to burst in spectacular fashion like tech stocks in 2000 and housing prices just before the Great Recession of 2008.   The problem with bitcoin and litecoin is that they are so volatile. Paper currencies like the dollar, euro and yen don't tend to move in such wild fashion. Neither does gold for that matter.   So it may be hard for cryptos to be used as a substitute for cash until the prices start to settle down. They also are not as available to the mainstream as old-fashioned paper money backed by governments.   SEC chairman Jay Clayton even sounded the alarm bell on bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings this week, saying ""there is substantially less investor protection"" than with stocks and bonds and ""correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.""   Related: ...and North Korea may be making a fortune from bitcoin too   But others argue that bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies will continue to gain in popularity for both spending purposes and as investments.   To that end, the Chicago Board Options Exchange launched futures trading for bitcoin on Sunday, a move that makes bitcoin potentially more attractive to large institutional investors in the same way that oil, sugar and other physical commodities are.   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is set to begin trading bitcoin futures on December 18 as well. And the Nasdaq is said to be considering following in the footsteps of the CBOE and CME too and could start to trade bitcoin futures next year. "

In South Korea, students are checking the price between classes, workers are trading it as they line up for coffee, and grandparents are playing the market at home.   Virtual currencies might be a fringe play elsewhere -- but in South Korea, they're mainstream. The country is home to three of the world's biggest bitcoin exchanges. On any given day, South Korea accounts for as much as 20% of all bitcoin trades around the world.   ""First, it was just tech people.

Here's what I learned   Bitcoin's value has jumped 1,500% so far this year to $17,000 as more and more people have bought into it.   It's in such high demand on Korean exchanges that South Koreans often end up paying a premium of between 15% and 25% over global prices. Local traders call it the ""kimchi premium,"" referencing the country's popular fermented cabbage dish.   Mom-and-pop investors are willing to pay a higher price in the hope that bitcoin will continue its dizzying rise.   ""They see it as gambling in some ways, they try to earn more money by using exchanges,"" said Kim Duyoung, a manager at bitcoin brokerage Coinplug.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Bitcoin exchanges like Bithumb have moved beyond their online beginnings, opening storefronts and customer service bays to make trading in virtual money even easier.

""I had someone I know who told me that this is good and that I should try it. That's why I'm doing it.""

The company told investors that they could expect the tokens to increase in value, and the company said it would help create a secondary market for the tokens, the SEC said.   The SEC said it would not seek a penalty against Munchee because the company shut down the coin offering quickly and returned the proceeds to investors without issuing tokens.

The panic of 2008-2009 sent the S&P 500 crashing to 666, wiping out trillions in wealth.   Fear is playing a less-obvious role helping to fuel today's red-hot stock market. In this case, it's fear of missing out, or FOMO, as Americans watch the stock market smash record after record.    ""You're seeing more people jumping in because they fear they are missing out on the bull market,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research.   Of course, it's never a good reason to buy something -- stocks, bonds or bitcoin -- just because everyone else is doing it. Investing should be backed up by solid fundamentals, not irrational emotions.   At its extremes, FOMO can cause real problems. It led many Americans to flip condos in Florida last decade, sparking an epic housing bubble that eventually burst. FOMO also drove the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s on the Nasdaq.   ""I remember one of the guys running the newspaper kiosk on Broadway asking me if I can print him stock reports on Intel and Cisco,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""That should have been an signal to me.""   To be sure, today's stock market looks much healthier than those notorious booms. Profits are at record highs, inflation is low, hiring is steady and economic growth at home and abroad is projected to accelerate. All good reasons for soaring stock prices.   Stovall doesn't think FOMO has taken over the market, though he's watching carefully for signs. ""Bull markets are like incandescent light bulbs,"" Stovall said, ""they tend to glow brightest just before they go out.""   On the other hand, Yardeni does see evidence of FOMO in the rush of money pouring into ETFs. He worries it's a sign the market is in the early stages of a ""melt-up"" -- a dangerous market rise that often ends in tears.   Yardeni has set an ambitious S&P 500 target for the end of next year of 3,100, or roughly 17% above current levels. If anything, he worries the soaring market could eclipse that level long before it's warranted.   ""If we get there in the next three to six months, then we'd be in a melt-up for sure,"" Yardeni said.   Related: Most Americans aren't benefiting from the stock market boom   2. Yellen's goodbye: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will hold what's likely to be her last press conference on Wednesday after policy makers conclude their final two-day meeting of the year. It seems all but certain the central bank will decide to raise its key interest rate one last time.   Under Yellen, the Fed has moved at a slow, deliberate pace in lifting rates as it has kept an eye on inflation, which has been stubbornly low. The Fed raised rates twice this year, first in March and again in June. The current rate -- between 1% and 1.25% -- is low compared to prior decades.   Related: Jerome Powell says Fed likely to hike rates in December   Wall Street does not expect Jerome Powell, Trump's nominee to lead the Fed, to stray far from Yellen's approach when it comes to setting monetary policy. But if the new tax plan jump-starts the economy, Powell may steer the Fed to raise rates faster to keep up with the pace of inflation.   3. Bitcoin futures debut on Chicago exchange: The Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, plans to launch bitcoin futures trading on Sunday at 6 p.m. ET. CME (CME), the derivatives marketplace, has said it will start trading bitcoin futures the following Sunday.   It's been a volatile week for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin surged above $17,000 for the first time on Thursday -- and plunged by more than $3,000 on Friday.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned   The bitcoin frenzy has ramped up, partially in anticipation of the start of futures trading on the CBOE, CME and other exchanges. But big banks have warned that bitcoin futures trading could be dangerous.   4. Net neutrality decision: The Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote on the repeal of Obama-era net neutrality protections on Thursday, despite calls from Democrats to delay the vote.   Currently, net neutrality rules bar internet providers like Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) from deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps, and prevents them from prioritizing their own content or the content of third-party services they strike deals with. FCC chairman Ajit Pai's plan would lift those bans -- and likely boost those companies. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring Time Warner, which owns CNN.)   Related: Trump FCC chair unveils plan to repeal net neutrality   Pai argues that the current laws micromanage internet providers, and that increased transparency will protect consumers. Critics worry that fewer regulations would let internet providers offer preferential treatment to companies that are willing to pay more.   5.

The numbers will reveal how well retailers performed during the Black Friday shopping period. Early estimates from ShopperTrak, a data analytics company that measures the number of shoppers at stores, said foot traffic was similar to last year.

In a blog post on his site, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sought to ""remind customers of some of the risks associated with trading digital currency"" -- which include wild price swings.   The price of a single bitcoin soared this week from under $10,000 to more than $17,000 before slumping back down to around $15,000, according to data from CoinDesk, which values bitcoin based on data from four exchanges, including Coinbase.   On Coinbase's exchange the price soared past $18,000 at one point.   Armstrong warned in his post on Thursday that the increased interest in cryptocurrencies, which was punctuated by a stunning bitcoin rally earlier this week, has led to ""extreme volatility and stress on our systems.""   Related: What's driving the bitcoin frenzy?   During the frenzy, Coinbase's valuation was consistently higher than the CoinDesk index -- at one point by a $2,000 margin. Even Saturday afternoon, Coinbase listed the price of a bitcoin around $15,000, while the CoinDesk hovered around $14,700.   Bitcoin's rise is mind-boggling considering just one year ago it traded for less than $800. At one point in 2011, it traded for about three bucks, according to CoinDesk.   Its stunning ascent was driven in large part by increasing attention from mainstream investors. And bitcoin's valuation has continued to balloon -- with a few sharp dips -- despite a smattering of warnings from top economists and business leaders.   Beginning Sunday, investors will be able to trade bitcoin futures via the Chicago Board Options Exchange. And they'll debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange a week later.   --CNNMoney's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report. "
283,283,Feds start to crack down on fraud as Bitcoin soars,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/08/technology/bitcoin-ico-fraud/index.html,"Dec 8, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The premier digital currency, Bitcoin, crossed $17,000 in value Thursday before plunging back to $14,000. Others like it are gaining in popularity as prices climb to meteoric heights.   While these new digital currencies are helping some pioneering investors gain quick wealth, federal authorities are warning about their potential for fraud.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned investors to be on the lookout for ""potential scams"" involving Initial Coin Offerings.   ICOs are sometimes called ""crowdsales"" and function similarly to an Initial Public Offering on the stock market, but without the governmental regulation. They typically receive investments in the form of cryptocurrency in exchange for shares known as tokens. But ICOs can be for any sort of startup -- they don't necessarily have to be for cryptocurrency companies.    The SEC's newly created Cyber Unit has started to take action on ""pump and dump"" schemes where fraudsters lure investors, take their money, and run.   The agency declined to comment specifically about the prevalence of fraud, but Todd Kornfeld, an attorney with Pepper Hamilton who specializes in financial regulations as well as ICOs and blockchain technology, said the feds are looking for obvious fraudsters.   ""So far, the cases that have attracted regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions appear to be blatant, outright frauds where apparently there were never any intentions of actually delivering a product or service, or so it has been alleged,"" Kornfeld said.   On December 4, the SEC said it froze the assets of PlexCorps, a company that was running an ICO for its own cryptocurrency called PlexCoins. It marked the first action from a newly created Cyber Unit inside the SEC that's looking to combat digital fraud.   Related: Price of Bitcoin breaches $15,000   The agency filed civil charges against Dominic Lacroix, his partner Sabrina Paradis-Royer and PlexCorps, for ""misappropriating investor funds illegally raised through the fraudulent and unregistered"" offer of PlexCoin. Before they were shut down, the ICO had raised nearly $15 million from thousands of investors since August by allegedly making false promises for a 13-fold profit in less than a month.   ""We intend to contest this case not in the media but in a court of law,"" said Jason Gottlieb, a lawyer for Lacroix and Paradis-Royer. ""Once the court appreciates the facts and the applicable law, I am confident the court will come to see this case differently than the SEC has presented in its papers to date.""   The SEC complaint says Lacroix is ""the subject of numerous proceedings related to fraudulent securities activities in Canada.""   In cases that are not so obvious, the agency said that investors can run free background checks on ICO providers through BrokerCheck on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's website.   There are other clues for detecting questionable ICOs, he said, like amateurish websites, a lack of coverage on news sites and industry blogs, a lack of official documentation, and a puffed-up sales technique that fails to warn of potential risks.   ""Spotting a potentially fraudulent ICO is no different from spotting a fraud in anything you buy or a business arrangement that you enter,"" Kornfeld said. ""It's partly a look and smell thing. Do things look right?""   Despite its Wild West atmosphere this relatively new market, which operates outside the tenets of regulated national currencies, is becoming increasingly hard for Wall Street to ignore.   Related: Bitcoin hack of NiceHash might have stolen $67 million   Major exchanges are getting into the game. Starting this month, investors will be able to trade Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Nasdaq could join the list next year.   The feds continue to take notice. In November, the FBI charged Brooklyn businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud for allegedly bilking investors out of $300,000 through an ICO scam called REcoin which he claimed was ""the first-ever cryptocurrency backed by real estate."" He was also hit with an SEC civil complaint.   He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers, Jason Nagi and Mildred Whalen, said Zaslavskiy did not intend to defraud investors.   Spotting fraud may be easier than predicting cyber-security issues.   Are you trading bitcoins? We want to hear from you about your experience    On Wednesday, NiceHash, a marketplace for mining digital currencies, said it was temporarily suspending its operations because hackers stole as much as $70 million in cryptocurrency.   Other exchanges have collapsed or disappeared under questionable circumstances, like the infamous Mt. Gox incident of 2014, where a bitcoin exchange in Japan shut down and froze hundreds of millions of dollars in funds. Some of the money was eventually returned from a ""forgotten"" digital wallet, but the company filed for bankruptcy with $64 million in debt. In 2015, Japanese prosecutors charged Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpelès with embezzlement. He pleaded not guilty and went to trial earlier this year.   Related: What on Earth is going on with Bitcoin?   Garrick Hileman, a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, said that it's often hard to tell the difference between a failed ICO and a deliberate scam. But he said regulatory scrutiny is increasing, at the same time that the market is growing and Bitcoin's price is soaring sky-high.   ""I think the regulators have signaled very clearly that they're watching the space very closely now and this is going to scare off some of the more blatant ICOs,"" he said. ""I think the ICOs we do see will be much better disguised. I think they'll have to be, to avoid scrutiny."" "
284,284,Bitcoin vs history's biggest bubbles: They never end well,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/08/investing/bitcoin-tulip-mania-bubbles-burst/index.html,"Dec 8, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The digital currency's massive surge this year -- it's up more than 1,400% -- has all the hallmarks of a huge speculative bubble, according to people such as Warren Buffett.   And if it bursts, the results are likely to be spectacular.   ""In terms of how it ends, bubble history suggests it will be with a bang, rather than a whimper,"" said Sharon Zoller, an economist at ANZ. ""I can't think of any reason why this time would be different.""   To better understand what may lie ahead, here's the lowdown on four famous financial bubbles in history:   Related: What is bitcoin?      In the early 17th century, speculation helped drive the value of tulip bulbs in the Netherlands to previously unheard of prices. Newly imported from Turkey, tulips were a big novelty at the time.   Hard data from those days is scarce, so it's difficult to gauge exactly how much prices soared. But people were putting up their homes as collateral, according to the Rijksmuseum -- the Museum of the Netherlands -- in Amsterdam.   Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin: Here's what I learned   Like many bubbles, prices were driven by greed or the fear of missing out. Speculators were buying bulbs in the hope that they could sell them on at an even higher price. Again, it didn't last. A flurry of sales caused a domino effect, and prices collapsed.   Stephen Innes, head of Asian trading at currency broker Oanda, believes bitcoin bubble could go the same way.   ""Prices will become so out of reach of the common man that ultimately demand fades,"" he said.  This is a modal window.      In the 18th century, shares in the South Sea Company, a British trading firm, soared on expectations it would soon reap bumper profits from trade with South America.   But the big money never materialized.   South America was controlled by Spain, which was at war with the British Empire at the time. That made a British trading monopoly in the region unlikely, according to the Encylopedia Britannica.   Related: Nobel winner says bitcoin 'ought to be outlawed'   Nevertheless, British mom-and-pop investors piled into the South Sea Company's stock, which popped about 900% in the space of a year.   Soon afterward, the shares began to plunge as speculators became sellers. The South Sea bubble's collapse left a trail of bankruptcies in its wake.  This is a modal window.        In the five years prior to October 1929's huge crash, stocks listed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed 500%.   Investors had become very bullish on the U.S. economy during the ""Roaring 20s,"" prompting them to keep bidding stock prices higher. Eventually cracks in the economy started to appear.   Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment   The crash didn't happen on just one day. The pain was spread out over several big plunges in the Dow, according to the Federal Reserve.   Making things much worse, many of the investors who had jumped on the bandwagon did so with borrowed money.   The crash led to the tremendous suffering of the Great Depression.   Wall Street didn't find its bottom until more than two years later, when the Dow languished 90% below its 1929 peak.      Investors were gripped by an internet frenzy in the late 1990s. They piled into web-focused companies, pushing the Nasdaq index up about 200% in the space of just over a year.   Those gains were fueled by a string of multibillion dollar stock floats during the era, many of which were unprofitable internet and software companies.   Are you trading Bitcoin? We want to hear from you.   The party didn't last. The bubble burst in early 2000, partly because higher interest rates made borrowing pricier. The Nasdaq plunged around 80% over the next couple of years.   But Shane Oliver, an economist at Australia's AMP Capital, said bitcoin's meteoric rise isn't quite like any previous bubbles he's seen before.   ""Bitcoin leaves them for dead."" he said. "

Its price has soared from less than $1,000 in January -- but with occasional sudden drops along the way.

Some have gone bust altogether and others have suffered cyber heists in which hackers have made off with huge sums. The latest example is digital currency site NiceHash, where bitcoins worth more than $70 million were stolen this week.      One factor driving bitcoin's price higher and higher in recent weeks is the expectation that big financial players like hedge funds and asset managers are set to wade into the market.

But first, there are two things you should know about me: I tend to be almost as afraid of losing money investing as I am of flying. On some level, I figured one fear might cancel out the other.   So last Thursday, while waiting for a flight to Nashville, I pulled up a popular application called Coinbase that can be used to buy and sell bitcoin. The virtual currency had hit $10,000 for the first time a couple days earlier, before retreating somewhat. News of bitcoin's rapid rise was everywhere, including on CNN.   Related: What is bitcoin?   For 15 minutes at the airport, I refreshed the price of bitcoin over and over, watching as it gained and lost hundreds of dollars in a matter of minutes. I called out the price fluctuations breathlessly to my wife, who gently encouraged me not to be an idiot, before returning to her magazine.   She was in good company. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently called bitcoin a ""fraud"" and suggested people who buy it are ""stupid."" Warren Buffett called bitcoin a ""mirage"" in 2014 and warned investors to ""stay away.""   Are you trading Bitcoin? We want to hear from you.   And yet bitcoin has climbed more than tenfold since Buffett's warning. Earlier this month, one college friend casually told me over drinks he'd made tens of thousands of dollars investing in another cryptocurrency. He said he hoped it would be worth enough one day to buy a house.   When I saw the price of bitcoin fall to $9,500, I pressed buy, defying the wisdom of two finance titans and my wife. One hundred dollars, or 0.0101 bitcoins. (A few days later, I bought another $150.) By the time we got to our hotel, my stake had already gone up 10%. One week later, it was (briefly) up 100%. My wife's opinion of me has reportedly decreased by the same amount.      It's an investing frenzy, plain and simple.   Bitcoin cracked $1,000 on the first day of 2017. By this week, it was up to $12,000, and then it really took off: The price topped $17,000 on some exchanges Thursday, and $18,000 on at least one. Other cryptocurrencies have seen similar spikes, though they trade for much less than bitcoin.   There's a long list of factors people may point to in an attempt to explain this. Regulators have taken a hands-off approach to bitcoin in certain markets. Dozens of new hedge funds have launched this year to trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The Nasdaq and Chicago Mercantile Exchange plan to let investors trade bitcoin futures, which may attract more professional investors.   Related: Bitcoin plunges more than $2,500 after hitting new record   Yet a key reason the price of bitcoin keeps going up is, well, because it keeps going up. Small investors like yours truly have a fear of missing out on a chance to get rich quick. And when the value of your bitcoin doubles in a week, as it did for me, it's easy to think you're a genius. But you can get burned assuming it will keep skyrocketing.  This is a modal window.     Some investors have likened the bitcoin hype to the dot-com bubble. Others, like Dimon, have said it's even ""worse"" than the Dutch tulip mania from the 1600s, considered one of the most famous bubbles ever.   As Buffett put it back in 2014, ""the idea that [bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."" Bitcoin is not backed by a company's earnings, or the strength of a government and rule of law. There's also no interest or dividends.      Bitcoin serves as a new kind of currency for the digital era. It works across international borders and doesn't need to be backed by banks or governments.   Or at least that was the promise when it was created in 2009. The surge and volatility of bitcoin this year may be great for those who invested early, but it undermines bitcoin's viability as a currency.   Related: Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environment   Right now, I can use my bitcoin holdings to pay for purchases at Overstock (OSTBP), or book a hotel on Expedia (EXPE). But if I use bitcoin to buy $25 worth of socks on Overstock today, and the price of bitcoin quadruples next week, I'll feel like those socks actually cost me $100. Then again, if bitcoin crashes, at least I'll always have the socks.   Rather than a currency, bitcoin is being treated more like an asset, with the hope of reaping great returns in the future.        Yes, the technology behind it.   Bitcoin is built on the blockchain, a public ledger containing all the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin. Transactions are added to ""blocks"" or the links of code that make up the chain, and each transaction must be recorded on a block.   Even bitcoin critics like Dimon have said they support the use of blockchain technology for tracking payments.      Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack.   Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product.   There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone.   Related: Millions of dollars stolen in bitcoin hack   With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer.   My original $100 bitcoin purchase won't officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won't be able to sell at the earliest until Friday.   If the price plummets before then, I'm out of luck.

That made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. It's also been adopted by businesses around the world as a way to pay for everyday things like groceries, train tickets and haircuts.   Exchanges, or marketplaces, allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. People can send bitcoins to each other using mobile apps or their computers. It's similar to sending cash digitally, and a fee is charged for every transaction.   Bitcoins are stored in a ""digital wallet"" — a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money.   This is a modal window.   Its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become more interested.

""There is admittedly a lot of speculation in this market,"" he said.  This is a modal window.     Bitcoin is also being driven higher by the hands-off approach many financial regulators seem to be taking toward the digital currency, Chapman said.   Japan's government, for example, gave bitcoin the seal of approval and started licensing bitcoin exchanges earlier this year.   The only black mark has been China, which has been cracking down on some uses of the virtual currency.   Announcements from some major financial institutions in the U.S. are helping bitcoin gain greater mainstream acceptance.

For much of this year, it's mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in.   Many are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts.   But the biggest gains from the virtual currency's massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors.

According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more.   Big institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they'll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.      Some industry insiders are incredibly bullish.   Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitmex, predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors ""pull the trigger"" on investing in the digital currency.   Octagon's Chapman is willing to stick his neck out even further. He thinks it will go above $100,000 before 2018 is over.

Just a small amount of mainstream investors' money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said.     But some finance industry veterans are wary.   Oanda's Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: ""Be fearful when others are greedy.""

Several of the world's most intractable problems rose up again this week -- for entirely new (and some would say, unnecessary) reasons.   Take a look at the issue of Northern Ireland and how to maintain an open southern border with the Irish republic, post Brexit. The failure of the U.K. and EU to agree on a solution acceptable to all parties threatens to dash Theresa May's hopes of moving the EU negotiations in the new year. This uncertainty over the Irish issue and what it means for Brexit took its toll on the pound as many commentators said there is no easy solution.     The Middle East is another geopolitical fault line.

There was a rotation out of technology stocks and into older industrials at first. But by week's end, that rotation had rotated, with the Nasdaq bouncing back. Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised. The end of the year is nigh. Big tech stocks are sitting on sizable gains that can be locked in while banks, industrials and energy firms offer more value.    I just wish that the outlook wasn't so unclear and that there weren't so many pitfalls ahead. Worries that many thought were cast aside could rise up and bite back once again.        Bitcoin is has topped $16,000, fueling fears of a bubble.   While it's true there is an element of tulip mania here -- even Venezuela wants to launch its own cryptocurrency -- it's worth noting that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Nasdaq are launching bitcoin futures. That may attract more interest from institutional investors.   But bitcoin is very risky. A leading digital currency marketplace was just hacked. Banks are warning regulators about fraud.   And there are concerns about the environmental impact of having massive data centers consuming tons of electricity to mine bitcoin.   -- Paul R.

One of the country's biggest state-owned firms has filed a lawsuit against Venezuela's oil company, PDVSA, in U.S. court.   Sinopec is accusing PDVSA of breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud, and is asking for $23.7 million plus interest and damages.

When does Musk sleep?   -- Paul R. La Monica        GE's epic cash crunch has been driven by bad bets on fossil fuels.   GE's power division is bleeding because utilities are moving to renewables like solar. That's painful for GE, which makes equipment that helps power one-third of the world. Worse: GE recently shelled out $9.5 billion on Alstom's coal business.   Now, GE's power business is slashing 12,000 jobs to cut costs and stabilize the depressed stock price. Germany's Siemens similarly cut nearly 7,000 jobs, mostly in its power business.

Environmentalists worry about another risk -- that it's seriously hurting efforts to combat climate change.

Related: What on earth is going on with bitcoin?   Unlike the dollar or the pound, these virtual ""coins"" aren't tied to a central bank. Instead, bitcoins are ""mined"" by computers in vast data centers that guzzle huge amounts of energy.   Bitcoin uses about 32 terawatts of energy every year, enough to power about three million U.S. households, according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index published by Digiconomist, a website focused on digital currencies.   By comparison, processing the billions of Visa (V) transactions that take place each year consumes the same amount of power as just 50,000 American homes, according to Digiconomist.   Related: Millions of dollars may have been stolen in bitcoin hack   More worryingly, Bitcoin's energy demands are set to explode.   ""As bitcoin grows, the math problems computers must solve to make more bitcoin get more and more difficult,"" which means more processing power is needed, Holthaus wrote.   And he made a startling forecast: Without a significant change in how transactions are processed, bitcoin could be consuming enough electricity to power the U.S. by the middle of 2019.   Six months later, that demand could equal the world's power consumption.   The fact that most bitcoin is mined in China is also fueling the environmental concerns.   Related: Bitcoin bubble brewing is it still a bargain?   The country's hinterlands have proved attractive for the data centers that bitcoin mining requires because ""electricity and land are very cheap,"" researchers at the University of Cambridge wrote in a recent study.

Big bitcoin miners have defended their operations, telling the Cambridge researchers that they believe their environmental impact pales in comparison with that of extracting natural resources such as oil.   And more eco-friendly power sources are being adopted. Vienna-based HydroMiner, for example, uses renewable hydroelectric power for its bitcoin operations   But some experts are very pessimistic about the future.

That is expected to prompt a flurry of interest from the big, professional money managers who have so far stayed on the sidelines of the bitcoin party. More demand for the digital currency is likely to push energy use even higher.   ""The CME futures may institutionalize bitcoin, which would be disastrous [for the environment],"" said John Quiggin, an economics professor at the University of Queensland.

299,299,Venezuela plans its own version of bitcoin as debt crisis worsens,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/04/news/economy/venezuela-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Dec 4, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   President Nicolas Maduro announced plans to create a cryptocurrency, dubbed ""the Petro,"" as a way to defeat the ""financial blockade"" imposed by U.S. sanctions on his regime.   Cryptocurrencies are virtual ""coins"" that are ""mined"" by computers using complex algorithms. The most famous and widely used cryptocurrency is bitcoin.   Maduro said the Venezuelan cryptocurrency would be backed by the country's oil, gold, gas and diamond reserves. Venezuela is home to the world's largest crude oil reserves, but its production has steadily declined to a 13-year low after companies halted some operations because of unpaid bills.   Related: 'Death spiral': 4,000% inflation in Venezuela    Its gold, gas and diamond holdings are few smaller and they're counted by the nation's central bank in its $9.7 billion of dwindling foreign reserves, a paltry sum for any country.   Maduro blames Trump administration sanctions for making U.S. banks unwilling to participate in financial transactions with the Venezuelan government, either as buyers or payment processors.   However, the cryptocurrency is unlikely to resolve the country's deep financial problems.   The Venezuelan government and its state-run oil company, PDVSA, both defaulted on certain bonds in November, according to ratings agencies. Many experts believe the missed payments mean the country is set to default on all of its roughly $65 billion debt due to bondholders. That would likely worsen the nation's already severe food and medical shortages.   In total, Venezuela owes about $141 billion to its investors. They include China, Russia, oil service companies and a slew of other entities, according to Moody's Investor Service. Russian leaders recently agreed to delay $3.5 billion of Venezuelan debt payments, but that break is unlikely to resolve the South American nation's debt crisis.   Related: Russia extends financial lifeline to Venezuela    Maduro's announcement also comes at a time of growing interest in cryptocurrencies.   Bitcoin has enjoyed a stunning rise, soaring more than 1,000% in value this year. It started 2017 at less than $1,000, but skyrocketed past $11,000 last week. But some high-profile figures in finance and economics have warned of a potential bubble.  This is a modal window.     What's also breathtaking is the collapse of Venezuela's currency this year. It took about 3,100 bolivars to buy one U.S. dollar at the beginning of the year. Now, a dollar is worth 103,000 bolivars, according to the unofficial exchange rate tracked by dolartoday.com. One expert says inflation is on track to hit 4,000% this year.    Maduro said Sunday that the new cryptocurrency would be used to make financial transactions. But it's unclear whether bondholders would exchange payments due in U.S. dollars -- the dominant global currency -- for a new and potentially unpredictable digital currency.   Maduro, whose regime has been widely labeled a dictatorship, didn't say whether the cryptocurrency would be used by ordinary Venezuelans to buy groceries, medicines or other basics.   Related: Venezuela just defaulted, moving deeper into crisis   It isn't the first time Maduro has been creative with Venezuela's cash. His government created a new exchange rate in 2015 then later got rid of it. The country's other two official rates are considered meaningless and heavily overvalued in light of the nation's economic collapse and lack of reliable data.   With soaring inflation, Maduro promised a year ago to print bills of bolivars with higher denominations to try to alleviate Venezuelans' financial pain somewhat. But there was such high demand for them upon arrival that cash shortages persisted. Venezuelans queue up daily outside ATMs, sometimes for over an hour. The maximum that can be withdrawn from an ATM in Venezuela is 30,000 bolivars (about 30 U.S. cents).   Maduro is known to make sweeping statements that are met with applause but don't produce any tangible results. In September, he announced a plan to give rabbits to families suffering from food shortages in order to help address widespread hunger.   So far, no further news of the ""rabbit plan"" has emerged. "
300,300,Quest: Bitcoin bubble brewing or is it still a bargain?,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/investing/quest-bitcoin/index.html,"Dec 1, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Once again we spent much of the week looking at bitcoin, as its price roared up and then dropped sharply. Many of us are bemoaning the fact we hadn't invested in this cryptocurrency, while others warned that this could be a bubble waiting to burst.   It's too easy to write off bitcoin as a deregulated scam, a Ponzi scheme, or a modern day version of tulip mania destined to end in tears -- although some of these warnings are probably warranted. Several stocks are surging on bitcoin hype as well.   But having visited a bitcoin mine in Iceland this summer, I saw the thousands of computers racing to authenticate bitcoin transactions. You can't just dismiss this as a fad.   Sign up for the weekly Quest newsletter in your inbox   Still, there's another (pardon the pun) side to the bitcoin. We should not just accept the notion that bitcoin is the new source of money for the future, replacing paper currencies and gold. The fact that bitcoin prices roared up to over $11,000 and then just as quickly fell back to $9,300 in a matter of hours shows all the hallmarks of pure speculation. Money is being invested purely on the possibility of making more money because other investors are pouring in and pushing the price higher. This is different from stocks where the price is led by the earnings of the company involved, dividends and other tangible financial measures.   Whatever happens to bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies are gaining ground and more respect. Ethereum, for instance, has far more transparency. So while this week reinforced the fact the crypto revolution is coming, it also showed you can lose your shirt buying and selling bitcoin.        A Trump administration official said the White House is ""very encouraged"" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reforms -- especially efforts to overhaul India's tax code and simplify regulations. The comments came as Ivanka Trump spoke at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad and encouraged India to boost the number of women in the workplace.   President Trump has a personal stake in India's success. The Trump Organization, now run by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, has five properties in development in India.   And India's economy is starting to rebound, but its growth rate still trails China's.   -- Paul R. La Monica        The Dow has rocketed through another milestone: 24,000.

Lofty price tags mean long-term returns are likely to be less explosive.   -- Matt Egan        President Trump is getting ready to turn up the heat on North Korea again. But after a heavy clampdown on Kim Jong Un's regime earlier this year, what options are left?   In short, North Korea's access to Chinese banking institutions, cutting down on oil exports to North Korea and putting more strain on the country's shipping industry, given its heavy reliance on trade.   Trump's challenge: Getting China and other countries to pressure North Korea, too. So far, their pressure hasn't amounted to the kind of regime change Trump wants to see.   -- Patrick Gillespie        On Wednesday, NBC fired Matt Lauer, the longtime co-host of the ""Today"" show, after the network received a complaint about ""inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.""   The program is broadcast to millions across the U.S. each day and is one of the most profitable franchises on television. It's also notable because Lauer led conversations on air about sexual assault and harassment.

""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention,"" he told Bloomberg TV. ""It doesn't serve any socially useful function.""   Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel for his work on bubbles, said the currency appeals to some investors because it has an ""anti-government, anti-regulation feel.""   ""It's such a wonderful story,"" he said at a conference in Lithuania, according to Bloomberg. ""If it were only true.""   Wall Street titans were getting in on the action, too.   Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that the currency serves as ""a vehicle for perpetrating fraud."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC that it ""seems like a bubble.""

Related: Bitcoin at $11,000: What the heck is going on?   The criticisms have done little to temper bitcoin's (XBT) meteoric -- if wild -- rise this week.   The virtual currency powered above $11,000 for the first time on Wednesday, capping a jaw-dropping rally of more than 1,000% since the start of the year. But it then plunged by more than $2,000, providing a stark reminder of its extreme volatility.   It was trading at $10,700 on Friday.   Some experts argue that the gains in recent weeks have been driven in part by the expectation that more major investors -- like hedge funds and asset managers -- are gearing up to start investing in the digital currency.   CME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Friday it will list bitcoin futures in mid-December. Nasdaq, meanwhile, plans to launch bitcoin futures next year. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies and metals.   Blankfein acknowledged that the currency could have potential if volatility drops.   ""If it works out and gets more established ... we'll get to it,"" he said.

Senate Republicans had hoped their tax bill would easily win approval this week, but there are now concerns over its cost.   Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, has made clear that he will not vote for a tax bill that increases the deficit.

303,303,"Bitcoin craziness spreads to Overstock, Square",http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/30/investing/bitcoin-overstock-square-stocks-cryptocurrency/index.html,"Nov 30, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Several stocks have recently seen their fortunes rise and fall along with the breathtaking moves in bitcoins. The leading cryptocurrency has captivated the finance world by skyrocketing to $11,000 this week after starting the year at less than $1,000. Bitcoin quickly plunged back down to around $9,000 after peaking Wednesday.   Check out the meteoric rise of Overstock.com, the e-commerce company that has cozied up to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. In recent months, Overstock has revealed plans to accept all cryptocurrencies on its platform and to open up a crypto exchange.   Overstock (OSTK) shares spiked a ridiculous 310% between the end of July and their peak on Monday. It's an unbelievable move that even bested bitcoin's spike during that period. Not bad for a stock that had been down on the year before that point.   But much like bitcoin itself, Overstock is vulnerable to sudden nosedives. The stock has collapsed 20% over the past two days, echoing bitcoin's retreat. Overstock didn't make any announcements that would explain its drop this week.   ""Bitcoin's a wild ride. If you've hitched your cart to that horse, you're going on a wild ride yourself,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.     Related: Bitcoin at $11,000: What the heck is going on?   Square, the popular mobile payments service run by Twitter (TWTR) boss Jack Dorsey, is also getting in on the bitcoin boom.   Square (SQ) was already having a terrific year when it announced on November 15 an experiment to allow some users of its Cash app to purchase bitcoin.   ""We're always listening to our customers and we've found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy bitcoin,"" a spokesperson for Square said in an email to CNNMoney.   News that Square is dabbling in bitcoin sparked a frenzy that lifted the company's stock by 24% in the span of 10 calendar days.   The bitcoin pop proved fleeting for Square though. The stock plummeted 16% on Monday after financial services firm BTIG downgraded it to ""sell."" Square retreated again in recent days as bitcoin dipped.   BTIG analyst Mark Palmer acknowledged that Square has suddenly become viewed as a ""play on a trendy cryptocurrency.""   It's ""not optimal from a risk standpoint"" for Square to have ""its fortunes tied to those of a cryptocurrency that has frequently displayed extreme volatility,"" Palmer wrote.   Besides, Palmer said that even if Square's bitcoin experiment succeeds and it can start charging a fee for trades, the cryptocurrency would only provide a ""marginal"" boost to the company's revenue.   Related: Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance    Here's another bitcoin mover: Riot Blockchain (RIOT). This very tiny company -- a market value of just $110 million makes it subject to violent swings -- has spiked 245% so far this year. It's nearly doubled this month alone.   Riot calls itself a ""first mover"" in blockchain, which is the technology that bitcoin is built on. Blockchain is a public ledger containing the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin.   It's clear the enormous potential of bitcoin has captured the imagination of investors looking for the next big thing.   The cryptocurrency has even received support from some established players. For instance, Nasdaq (NDAQ) confirmed to CNNMoney that it plans to launch bitcoin futures next year. That follows plans by CME Group (CME), the owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to start listing bitcoin futures, which allows investors to buy and sell an asset (often commodities like oil or gold) at a specified price at a later date.   And bitcoin has its fair share of believers, including Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein and PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel.   Still, some market analysts see these stock moves as a sign of overexuberance.   Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a recent report that while ""we don't know when the bitcoin craziness will end,"" the bitcoin-related stock swings ""echo"" back to the way that internet stocks moved at the end of the dotcom bubble.   ""If a stock like Campbell Soup decided to announce that it was putting all of its soup containers on the blockchain,"" Bespoke wrote, ""it would probably double or maybe even triple!""   --CNNMoney's Paul R.

Some experts say that would actually help the economy. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. North Korea It feels like the crisis with North Korea has reached a dangerous new phase. The North says it successfully tested its most powerful missile yet. Defense Secretary James Mattis says the regime can now hit targets ""everywhere in the world"" (that would include Hawaii, which is set to test nuke sirens for the first time since the Cold War). The Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile stayed in the air for almost an hour during the test-firing before splashing down off the coast of Japan. President Trump was unusually muted in his response -- no ""Rocket Man"" insults this time -- saying only that ""we will take care of it."" CNN's Stephen Collinson says Trump's response reflects the fact that the President just doesn't have a lot of good options to deal with this crisis. 2. Tax overhaul For the GOP's tax overhaul effort, one big hurdle has been crossed, but there are more obstacles ahead. The Senate version of the tax plan passed the Budget Committee on a party line vote of 12-11. Now the bill goes to the full Senate for a vote, which may happen this week. President Trump and GOP leaders are thrilled but, as CNN's Chris Cillizza notes, getting this thing through a committee isn't the same as getting it through the full Senate. Concerns over how this tax plan might explode the deficit, how it might lead to higher health care premiums (because it would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate) and how it would affect small businesses could still lead to Republican ""no"" votes, and the GOP can only afford to lose two of those. 3. Tampa slayings A 24-year-old man has been arrested in the killings of four people in Tampa, Florida's Seminole Heights neighborhood. A state grand jury will soon consider four counts of first-degree murder against Howell Emanuel Donaldson III. The neighborhood has been on edge for almost two months after four seemingly random shootings that killed people doing ordinary things, like crossing the street and waiting at a bus stop. A tip about a man with a gun in a bag at a McDonald's led to Donaldson's arrest, but police won't say much more than that right now. 4. Rep. John Conyers There's a serious effort underway to get Rep. John Conyers to resign. Conyers, the House's longest-serving current member, faces allegations of sexual misconduct. Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- Conyers is a founding member -- are trying to ease his exit without trampling on his legacy, which includes his work in the civil rights movement. Conyers denies the allegations and vows not to resign, although he did step down from the House Judiciary Committee. The House Ethics Committee is investigating him. And another accuser came forward saying Conyers made three sexual advances towards her when she worked for him in his Detroit office.   5. Automation Attention workers: The machines are coming for your jobs. As many 375 million workers worldwide will have to switch career fields by 2030 because of automation, says a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute. If your job involves operating machinery, prepping fast food, collecting data or processing documents (like mortgage origination), you may need to start thinking about retraining in a different field. The report also says governments and companies need to help workers out during these transitions. BREAKFAST BROWSE People are talking about these. Read up. Join in.

Bitcoin started the year worth less than $1,000. It's now stormed past $11,000 -- a staggering jump of over 1,000%.   So how does the virtual digital currency work -- and what's behind its meteoric rise?      Bitcoin (XBT) was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use.   Unlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren't issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are ""mined"" by computers using complex algorithms.   Related: Bitcoin hits $11,000 and then plummets   Payments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name.   That made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become interested.      Some experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been ... higher prices.   Investors have been buying as they fear ""they're missing the party"" or ""losing out on a quick profit,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia trading at online broker Oanda. ""Intense media coverage"" in recent months has also convinced more investors to pile in, he added.   Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong's Bitmex, an exchange for trading financial instruments based on bitcoin, said the digital currency is in a ""positive feedback loop.""   Related: Can anything stop bitcoin?   In other words, investors see the price is increasing and want a piece of the action, moving prices higher still.   The sentiment has been backed up by indications that bitcoin is getting greater mainstream acceptance. Next month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   That would give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors.      For much of this year, it's mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in.   Many are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts.   But the biggest gains from the virtual currency's massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors.

According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin (about $1,000) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more.   Big institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they'll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon.      Some industry insiders are incredibly bullish. Hayes predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors ""pull the trigger"" on investing in the digital currency.   With a total value of around $175 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets.   ""This is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily"" in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors' money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said.   But some finance industry veterans are wary.   Oanda's Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: ""Be fearful when others are greedy.""   ""Following the herd rarely produces large scale gains,"" Innes said.   Investors were given a reminder of bitcoin's unpredictability on Wednesday. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before recovering some of those losses. "

The virtual currency powered past $11,000 for the first time on Wednesday, capping a jaw-dropping rally of more than 1,000% since the start of the year. But it then plunged by more than $2,000, providing a stark reminder of its extreme volatility.   Long shunned by regular investors as a murky domain for cranks and criminals, bitcoin (XBT) has gained growing mainstream acceptance this year, helping propel its value higher and higher.   It's been smashing through milestones at an increasing rate: it soared above $8,000 just over two weeks ago and only passed $9,000 for the first time over the weekend.   On Wednesday, bitcoin climbed as high as $11,350. But it then nosedived more than 18% to below $9,300 as two major exchanges where it's traded said they were struggling to deal with a huge spike in traffic. By Thursday morning in Hong Kong, it had regained some ground to trade around $10,400.   While bitcoin's stratospheric rise this year has prompted warnings of a bubble, experts say that the gains in recent weeks have been driven in part by the expectation that more major investors -- like hedge funds and asset managers -- are gearing up to start investing in the digital currency.

Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies, metals and agricultural commodities.   Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies that have proliferated in recent years. Unlike the dollar or the pound, these virtual ""coins"" aren't tied to a central bank. Instead, they are ""mined"" by computers using complex algorithms.   The decentralized nature of bitcoin is what appeals to many of its enthusiasts and unnerves a lot of its skeptics.   It also makes it harder to settle arguments about whether the currency's huge gains this year amount to a bubble. Unlike stocks, its value isn't based on earnings or dividend payouts, and unlike bonds it doesn't pay investors a steady stream of income.   Related: Bitcoin costs as much as $13,000 in Zimbabwe    And the global market for bitcoin, at nearly $190 billion, is still relatively small.

Experts said previously that the $10,000 mark would be a key milestone for the digital currency.

Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein pointed out last month that ""folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.""   Bitcoin's stunning ascent this year hasn't been particularly smooth.   Wednesday's sudden losses after it topped $11,000 was the latest in a series of jarring drops.

The scenes of unbridled joy in Zimbabwe following the resignation of Robert Mugabe were remarkable. His 37-year rule brought misery to the nation, devastated its economy and left its citizens impoverished and terrified. Now it's over.   What comes next? Former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will be the interim president until scheduled elections in 2018. But he was also the right hand man for Mugabe over 4 decades. His role as Mugabe's enforcer earned him the nickname of ""The Crocodile."" So if past performance is any guide to future prospects, it could be out of the pan and into the fire.   The challenges facing Zimbabwe are formidable. Mnangagwa and his eventual successor must first stabilize its economy before it can entertain any rosy hopes of attracting international investment. This means getting to grips with its currency fiasco. Zimbabwe's new leaders also need to get a firm grasp of the country's budget deficit and start to think about dealing with its debt. That could mean tough decisions which, in the short term, will inflict more economic pain on people who have already suffered so much.   Help will be needed from ""the usual suspects"" too -- the IMF, World Bank and the African Development Bank. Regional powers like South Africa will have to play their part in creating confidence for investors as well.    All of this will be wasted if Mnangagwa and the ruling Zanu-PF party haven't learned from Mugabe's failures. I don't want to be harsh. But before we rush to prop up Mnangagwa with good cash after bad, let's make sure ""The Crocodile"" isn't planning to bite the hands that look to feed Zimbabwe.

It's part of a plan of Tencent founder Ma Huateng -- known as ""Pony"" since his surname Ma translates to horse in English -- to build a major tech conglomerate.

311,311,Trump administration slaps more sanctions on North Korea,http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/21/news/economy/treasury-north-korea-sanctions/index.html,"Nov 21, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   ""As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximize economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement.   In total, Tuesday's action targets one individual, 13 companies and 20 vessels that have engaged in trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars with North Korea.    Treasury said a number of persons targeted in the announcement operate in the North Korean transportation industry or import or export goods to the rogue state. North Korea is known to employ deceptive shipping practices, including ship-to-ship transfers, according to the Treasury Department.   Related: Trump gives 'final warning' on North Korea trade    Three Chinese trading companies exported roughly $650 million in goods to North Korea and imported more than $100 million. The products included notebook computers, coal and iron.   Another Chinese firm, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial, exported more than $28 million in motor vehicles, electrical machinery and other items associated with nuclear reactors to North Korea over several years. Dongyuan has also been associated with front companies for North Korean organizations known to develop weapons of mass destruction.   Another organization was designated for exporting workers from North Korea.   The latest move comes a day after Trump declared he was placing North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. President George W. Bush removed the rogue nation from the list in 2008.   North Korea is now one of only four countries in the world with that label. The others include Iran, Sudan and Syria.   President Trump has been steadfast in upholding his policy of exerting ""maximum pressure"" on North Korea to isolate the regime. Monday's announcement was seen by analysts as a diplomatic tool by the administration to heighten pressure on foreign countries to stop doing business with North Korea.   ""Anything you can do to add on to the narrative business with North Korea is not acceptable -- and certainly the state sponsor determination does that -- pushes it in the right direction to cut off their relationships,"" said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.   Such a designation, prevents North Korea from receiving U.S. foreign assistance and places a ban on defense exports and sales. The designation also allows the U.S. to punish people or countries who trade with it.    Related: North Korea still making millions from small arms exports    Under sanctions legislation signed by Trump in August, the State Department was required to report to Congress whether it would re-designate North Korea earlier this month. The agency had opted to delay the decision until after the president's trip to Asia.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged the designation would bring a few new sanctions beyond those already imposed. But he noted the decision to add North Korea back to the list was ultimately a message to the regime about the U.S.'s resolve to ""disrupt and dissuade"" certain actors from doing business with North Korea.   The latest sanctions are expected to be one of several to be announced against North Korea in the coming weeks, Trump said on Monday. The series of actions would bring U.S. sanctions against Pyongyang to their highest level ever.   Already, the Treasury Department has designated eight North Korean banks and more than two dozen North Korean nationals working in countries like China, Russia and Libya.   The North Korean regime is believed to use a complex network of front companies to do business in China and other countries in order to dodge sanctions. The September order put the onus on banks and other firms to find out whether their clients have any dealings with North Korea.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest    In September, Trump signed an executive order that would penalize any company or person doing business with North Korea by either cutting off their access to the U.S. financial system or freezing their assets -- or potentially both.   Under the order, Trump gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Tillerson more power to slap sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear efforts. Mnuchin now has the ability to freeze assets of any individual or business that trades in goods, services or technology with Pyongyang.   Mnuchin said last week at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council he has no doubt sanctions work. ""In the case of Iran, the only reason they came to negotiate was this,"" he said.   ""We're going through a process where I think the sanctions are beginning to work [in North Korea] and we'll continue to put more on,"" he said.   --CNN's Dan Merica, Jeremy Diamond and Zachary Cohn contributed to this report.

The opinions in this article belong to the author.  (CNN)When I was growing up in an orphanage in St. Petersburg with spina bifida, my only way to be mobile was to walk on my hands. I had no other option. As a child, I would try to keep up with the other kids solely using my hands for movement. For me, being mobile was key to my happiness: without it, I simply couldn't join in. That quest for mobility has been with me my entire adult life. After I'd been adopted and moved to the US, my high school said I wasn't allowed to do track sports simply because I was in a wheelchair.  I didn't take no for an answer, and neither did my adopted mom, Deborah, who took my case to the courts. That case eventually led to the Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act in Maryland. That landmark piece of legislation became federal law. It means that across America, students both with and without disability who never dreamed of competing in athletics teams are able to do so. I fought in the courts and in the statehouse because for me, mobility is freedom. I want that freedom to be extended to more people, and this is where technology can help. The pace of innovation across the world is breathtaking. The processing power that was a decade ago confined to huge servers is now available in inexpensive smartphones. Artificial intelligence is predicted to outperform human intelligence at translation, our favorite board games and even driving trucks within the next decade, according to Katja Grace at the University of Oxford. The humble battery is undergoing a revolution too, with the technology to power an entire town from battery power alone within reach. Yet, for all the incredible advances we've seen in technology in recent years, mobility devices for many disabled people remain stuck in the past. Big ideas from Maglev trains to space travel capture the public imagination, but often simpler applications of new technologies could make a huge difference to our freedom to move. Smart assistive mobility devices have incredible potential: imagine a wheelchair that could integrate with our bodies to be more intuitive to our needs? Yet, the pace of innovation for personal mobility devices has been particularly slow. The first modern wheelchair of Harry C. Jennings, Sr. and his disabled friend Herbert Everest from 1933 is still the prototype for the wheelchair that many people with paralysis use. If we think of the innovations in motor vehicles or computing in the same period, it's hard to argue that mobility devices have kept pace. And that's not for a lack of ideas either: lots of people have great ideas how to improve mobility for disabled people, but it's a tough market to get into and regulation is often burdensome. This is why I'm backing Mobility Unlimited, a $4 million global challenge to transform the world of people with lower-limb paralysis. We're looking for the world's creative thinkers from inventors, technologists, designers and engineers, to come forward and submit their ideas on how we can improve mobility for people with lower-limb paralysis.  The challenge offers 10 $50,000 grants to people with a good idea: five finalists will be awarded $500,000 to develop their concepts, and the winner will receive $1 million to turn their idea into reality. I'm proud to be part of this journey and cannot wait to see the winning device unveiled in Tokyo in 2020. Throughout my life, I've always thought that -- whether disabled or not -- we all go through challenges. Taking on challenges is an important part of living life to the fullest. When I said at 14 to my adoptive parents that I wanted to be an Olympic athlete, they said, ""Ok!"" and we started training. A year later, I was the youngest member of the American Paralympics team in Athens. You may doubt whether you can create a new invention that people can use, but if you do have a concept that could change the world for people with lower-limb paralysis, I say, ""Seize the day!"" There may be more hype around Bitcoin, but innovators could have far more impact if they turned their attention to how they can make the freedom to move available to all. We simply can't let technology leave disabled people behind. "

The virtual currency is now trading at a record high above $8,200 -- just a little more than a month after bitcoin first passed the $5,000 level. If this keeps up, bitcoin could be trading at $10,000 before the end of the year.   The price of one bitcoin (XBT) has surged more than 735% this year alone and has skyrocketed nearly 40,000% in the past five years.   Of course, bitcoin's meteoric rise has led to some skepticism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has bashed it on numerous occasions, calling it a ""fraud"" that's better off being used by drug dealers and North Korea.   And Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a billionaire whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL) and Citigroup (C), told CNBC before he was arrested in a sweeping anti-corruption probe that he thought bitcoin was an ""Enron in the making"" that will implode.   But while some see a bubble about to burst, others see opportunity. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase rival Goldman Sachs (GS), took issue with bitcoin critics.   Blankfein tweeted last month that ""folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold."" Interestingly, technical analysts at Goldman also correctly predicted earlier this month that bitcoin prices would soon top $8,000.   Related: Bitcoin hits $13,000 on Zimbabwe exchange   Blankfein raises an interesting point though. Sure, some investors are likely flocking to bitcoin as a speculative bet because they've watched the price climb higher and higher.   But there's also a legitimate case to be made that bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies are the future of money and that more and more people will conduct actual transactions using these currencies.   To that end, Square -- the popular mobile payment service run by Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey -- recently announced a trial that will let some users of its Cash app purchase bitcoin.   ""We're always listening to our customers and we've found that they are interested in using the Cash app to buy bitcoin,"" said a spokesperson for Square (SQ) in an email to CNNMoney.   ""We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system,"" the Square spokesperson added.   And CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said earlier this month it plans to soon list bitcoin futures contracts. CME (CME) CEO Terry Duffy noted that there has been ""increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets.""   Futures let investors buy and sell an asset at a specified price at a later date, They're popular bets for currencies, metals and agricultural commodities. In other words, CME Group is now treating bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset.   Related: Bitcoin prices have been incredibly volatile. What's going on?   Many others agree. Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors, wrote in a recent note to clients that bitcoin prices should keep rising simply because more and more people are likely to use it.   ""Bitcoin adoption could multiply the more people become aware of how much of their wealth is controlled by governments and the big banks,"" he said.   Holmes added that more startup companies are also looking to raise money through so-called initial coin offerings - the sale of digital currencies to investors instead of stock. That should lead to a further rise in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.   Dragonchain, a crytpocurrency startup originally backed by Disney (DIS), has held an ICO.

Her party could try again to form a coalition, or resort to a Merkel-led minority government. Another possibility is for snap national elections early next year.   The economic impact is likely to be limited, however.

Demand surged on Golix, which appears to be the only local Bitcoin exchange, after military leaders put 93-year-old leader Robert Mugabe under house arrest.   Bitcoin has long commanded higher prices in Zimbabwe, which scrapped its own currency in 2009 after years of hyperinflation made it worthless.   But the appearance of tanks on the streets of the capital Harare have pushed the price gap even wider. Bitcoin was trading on international exchanges for roughly $7,500 on Thursday.   The digital currency was quoted more broadly in line with world prices in online market places that allow buyers and sellers in Zimbabwe to deal directly with each other.   Related: Mugabe's exit is 'a done deal' but Zimbabwe is still in limbo   Elevated Bitcoin prices in Zimbabwe appear to be the result of the country's dysfunctional economy and mismatched supply and demand.   Since 2009, business in the country has been conducted in a number of foreign currencies, but exchange rates on the thriving black market are highly distorted. Dollars are in short supply, and strict capital controls are in place.   Last year, the country started printing bond notes -- backed by U.S dollars -- in a bid to ease a chronic shortage of cash. But many Zimbabweans worry they are a backdoor to the reintroduction of a local currency that would be doomed to massive devaluation.   ""In Zimbabwe, you are very limited with what you can do with the money in your bank account,"" Golix says on its website. ""Bitcoin is better than the money we're using now.""   Related: How Robert Mugabe killed one of Africa's richest economies   There is also the problem that local demand for Bitcoin far outstrips supply.   Only 16 Bitcoin have been traded on Golix over the past 24 hours, and 160 over the previous month.   Bitcoins are created through ""mining"" -- a process in which computers race to solve complex math problem, and winners are rewarded with chunks of the digital currency.   Mining requires huge amounts of electricity, and Golix says that energy prices in the region are simply too high to make the process cost effective.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   ""Bitcoin in circulation in Africa comes from people who bought it at an exchange elsewhere,"" the exchange says on its website.   Supply is likely remain low, however.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI issued joint alerts on Tuesday warning about two types of malware, or malicious software, that North Korean hackers are allegedly using against firms across industries such as aviation, finance, telecoms and media.   Related: Russia just gave North Korea's internet a big boost   One of them, known as FALLCHILL, has likely been in use since 2016 and allows hackers to monitor and control infected computers remotely. It typically spreads through files dropped by other malware or when users inadvertently download it by visiting websites that are already infected.   It also uses multiple layers of ""proxy malware,"" according to the DHS and FBI, that allow it to disguise its origin and make the hackers harder to trace.   The other type of malware, Volgmer, infects computers through a technique known as spear phishing, where users get an apparently legitimate email with a link that then spreads the virus. North Korean hackers have been using Volgmer since at least 2013, the U.S. authorities said.   Pyongyang has repeatedly denied involvement in any international cyberattacks.   Related: North Korea's long history of hacking   The FBI and DHS said both types of malware are associated with HIDDEN COBRA, a term the U.S. government uses to refer to ""malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government.""   The security agencies said in June this year that HIDDEN COBRA -- which includes groups such as Lazarus and Guardians of Peace that have been linked to previous attacks -- has been operating since 2009.   The DHS and FBI also identified dozens of IP addresses across several countries through which they believe Volgmer attacks are being routed. India accounts for the biggest share of the IP addresses, with around 25%, followed by Iran and Pakistan.   ""This highlights the need for nations to protect their infrastructure, not just for their own sake but also to make sure they don't become a pawn in someone else's war game,"" said Subramanian Udaiyappan, a cybersecurity specialist with Cisco (CSCO) in India.   ""Attackers persist with their already exploited infrastructure and tend to re-use them, which means India could become an unwilling perpetrator of more such attacks if action isn't taken immediately,"" he added.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   North Korea has been linked to some of the most high-profile cyberattacks in recent years, including a $101 million theft from Bangladesh's central bank in 2016, disruptions to neighbor South Korea's systems on multiple occasions and a 2014 hack on movie studio Sony Pictures.   More recently, the authoritarian regime was accused of being behind the WannaCry ransomware attack in May that crippled hundreds of thousands of computers around the world. A lawmaker in South Korea also claimed two weeks ago that North Korean hackers stole blueprints for South Korean warships and submarines. "

The digital currency gained as much as $920 on Monday, before losing some ground to trade near $6,500. Over the past week it has bounced as high as $7,720 and as low as $5,620 -- a swing of nearly 30%.   Analysts said that volatility has spiked after plans to split Bitcoin (XBT) into two were dropped last week amid a backlash from owners and fans of the currency.   The proposed split, or ""fork,"" would have allowed for faster transaction processing speeds.   ""One of the main problems with Bitcoin is that it does not scale up properly as more and more users adopt it,"" said Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.   But not everyone was on board with the plan. Bianchi said that opponents preferred the status quo because they see Bitcoin as an investment rather than a method of payment.   John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at the broker GFI, said that calling off the split caused Bitcoin prices to collapse and rival digital currencies to surge.   But he expected Monday's rebound and says it could continue.   ""Bitcoin has been prone to sizable corrections and we had two such large corrections just this year,"" he said. ""However, [in each case Bitcoin] subsequently made a new high.""   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Bitcoin owners don't have too much to complain about. The currency has gained nearly 600% this year, and its price has doubled from as recently as mid-September.   The momentum has been helped by several major endorsements. Japan recognized Bitcoin as legal tender in April. And CME Group (CME), which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, announced plans last month to start listing Bitcoin futures contracts during the fourth quarter.   But analysts are divided on the future of the alternative currency.   ""Bitcoin prices will be volatile -- it has been like that the last few years and it will be like that the next few years,"" said Ronnie Moas, an analyst at Standpoint Research. He thinks Bitcoin could reach $50,000 in just a few years.   Researchers at UBS, however, say that recent price rises are the result of speculative trading.   They wrote in a research note that following a twenty-fold increase in Bitcoin prices over two years, ""cryptocurrency prices are almost certainly a bubble."" "

Tall shelves are stacked with computer processors jutting out into the middle of the space, spewing gusts of hot air. If you've ever observed your laptop fan kick in, multiply that by about a thousand.   The 9,000 square meter warehouse is where boxy Soviet cars used to roll off the production line. Now, it hosts the work of Dmitry Marinichev, President Putin's internet ombudsman who heads his own IT solutions company RadiusGroup.   In 2014, Dmitry Marinichev was appointed to the role designed to act as a liaison between internet companies and the government. He was also recently named one of four potential presidential candidates from Russia's ""Party of Growth,"" a more Kremlin-friendly opposition party campaigning on a pro-business platform.   Marinichev is currently building what's called the Russian Mining Center, a project he hopes will put Russia on the cryptocurrency map.   Cryptocurrencies are virtual ""coins"" that are ""mined"" by computers completing complex algorithms. The most famous and widely used cryptocurrency is bitcoin. It exists on a shared data network called a ""blockchain"" and has no central bank or central authority, meaning transactions can be done between people and entities directly, without the need for banks or governments to be involved.   So far, Marinichev and his partners have invested $10 million dollars into the project. They've also raised the equivalent of $43 million in an Initial Coin Offering -- the cryptocurrency equivalent of an IPO -- and plan to add around five times as many ""mining computers"" to their facility by the end of the year.   The team manufactures the computers themselves. Playing host, Marinichev shows off a high-tech assembly line where 3D-modelled motherboards are stitched and soldered into life. Some will be used in this facility, others will be sold to other mining operations.   ""First of all, it's business,"" Marinichev told CNN. ""But this is a new milestone in the development of mankind.""      Russia is still a laggard when it comes to the official acceptance of cryptocurrencies.   Unlike the U.S. and much of Europe, it is currently illegal to pay for anything with cryptocurrencies in Russia or convert them into rubles.   And the central bank is not budging. In September, it issued a warning that the anonymity of cryptocurrencies could lead to citizens being drawn into ""illegal activities including laundering illegal funds, and the financing of terrorism.""   The central bank said it was ""premature"" to consider legalizing cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument. In October, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia said the bank was considering restrictions on websites that sell cryptocurrencies.   Marinichev is hoping his project will prove to Russian authorities that cryptocurrencies, and the blockchain technology that powers them are a critical part of the country's future.     He's already seeing signs of progress. In June, President Putin met with Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian inventor of Ethereum, the closest competitor to Bitcoin. The meeting sent a flutter of excitement through the cryptocurrency community in Russia.   The Kremlin read-out of the meeting stated the following: ""The President supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners.""   Putin recently held a high-level meeting with his finance minister and central bank chief on cryptocurrencies warning of ""serious risks,"" and could be used by criminals.   At the same time, however, he insisted Russia needs to come up with a way of regulating them.   That job has fallen to a special working group in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament. And it's far from easy. Elina Sidorenko, a criminal law professor who heads up that group, said her biggest concern was initially the anonymity of transactions and the difficulty of applying anti-money laundering standards to cryptocurrency payments.   But she told CNN new challenges keep appearing. Her group had been set to publish new legislation in October, but it had to delay it for a few months to try to factor in some new issues: the implications of China's crackdown on crytocurrency exchanges, as well as how to regulate ICO's and tokens.   Still, Sidorenko is convinced Russia can't afford to ignore the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies to ""advance the Russian economy.""   ""In addition to oil and natural resources, we have IT specialists, technologists, developers and computer geniuses conquering the world, so we should make use of this resource,"" she said.      Russian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs are already making an impact. Alexander Ivanov is a former physicist, who now runs Waves, a blockchain platform that allows users to create tokens for things like loyalty programs and vouchers, trade in cryptocurrencies, and make payments.   The company claims to have a market cap of around $400 million and says 80% of its business is actually done outside of Russia. Waves was recently behind a blockchain loyalty program from Burger King in Russia called ""Whoppercoin,"" where customers could accumulate digital tokens to redeem in store.   Ivanov said the attraction for him is the stability of the blockchain technology, and the fact that its decentralized so no one central authority can switch it off.   He said there's still a ""barrier of understanding"" for some people but that won't be forever.   ""I think blockchain will repeat the history of internet and probably even be bigger than the internet itself,"" he said.   Ivanov and I visited a Moscow restaurant called Lavkalavka, which is part of a farming collective that uses local, organically grown products. It started accepting bitcoin in August. The meal cost about 0.02BTC ($100).   The restaurant carried out a mirror transaction in rubles to avoid falling foul of the Russian legal system. Owner Boris Akimov said accepting bitcoin is a marketing initiative at the moment, and a way to help the company better understand cryptocurrencies.   His business also set up its own cryptocurrency called Biocoin, which is used by farmers in their cooperative to trade in goods and equipment. Biocoins are also used as a loyalty system in Lavkalavka and other participating and restaurants. People are given a certain amount when they buy something, and can exchange them for future purchases.      There are many reasons Russia is drawn to cryptocurrencies. Akimov said the idea of a financial system not dominated by the U.S. dollar is part of the appeal.   ""Cryptocurrency is a way to change the whole financial system in the world,"" Akimov said.   The banking system is currently under the stranglehold of U.S. and EU sanctions, and unable to access to Western capital.   ""I can't say that bitcoin will allow for dodging sanctions [because] that wouldn't be true,"" Marinichev said. ""Bitcoin can help the world change; it'll allow it to cleanse itself from the madness of some individuals, governments, parliaments.""   So far, experts say Russia only has about 3% of all bitcoin ""nodes"" -- or computers -- on the bitcoin network.   Another advantage to growing Russia's share is the cold weather, according to Marinichev. This means the expense of cooling the mining equipment is dramatically reduced. Electricity is also cheap, and there's a lot of it available.   For Sidorenko, cryptocurrencies are a bit like the Russian winter: difficult to manage but inevitable.   ""We must live with this reality, and we must regulate this thing,"" she said. ""But we must minimize the risks involved in using it."" "

The fact that bitcoin will now be joining other physical currencies as well as gold and other commodities is yet another sign of its growing legitimacy.

And Saudi Prince Alwaleed, a billionaire investor whose Kingdom Holding Company owns stakes in Apple (AAPL), Citigroup (C), Twitter (TWTR) and CNN owner Time Warner (TWX), told CNBC last month he thought bitcoin was an ""Enron in the making"" that will implode.   Related: Bitcoin keeps surging to new record highs   Both Dimon and Prince Alwaleed have been proven wrong in the short-term at least as the price of bitcoin has continued to soar.   Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at online foreign exchange broker FXTM, wrote in a report Wednesday that the CME's endorsement of bitcoin cannot be underestimated. It could help bring in more big-time institutional investors.

321,321,What is fueling Zimbabwe's record-breaking Bitcoin binge?,http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/31/africa/zimbabwe-bitcoin-surge/index.html,"Oct 31, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)The most expensive bitcoin in the world are flying off virtual shelves in Zimbabwe.   The price of the digital currency has soared beyond $10,000 over the past week on Harare-based trading platform Golix, almost double the rates on major international exchanges.   ""The price has been high for some time and it keeps going up,"" says Golix trade coordinator Yeukai Kusangaya. She expects soaring demand to drive the price even higher.   Bitcoin is no longer a specialist curiosity in Zimbabwe. The virtual currency is in increasingly common usage, even accepted by businesses such as car dealers.  A uniquely dysfunctional economy has created ideal conditions for the bitcoin surge.   Safe haven  Zimbabwe is undergoing a fresh currency crisis.     President Robert Mugabe's administration addressed rampant hyperinflation in 2008 by ditching the Zimbabwean dollar and replacing it with US currency. But the southern African nation now faces an acute shortage of US dollars that has led to banks rationing withdrawals.  The government has sought to make up the shortfall by issuing ""bond notes"" that it claims have equivalent value to the US dollar. But their value has dropped sharply on black market exchanges, leading to price inflation in stores, and they are not accepted by foreign suppliers.  International trade is further complicated by strict capital controls, which have left importers searching for creative solutions -- including digital currencies.     ""Bitcoin isn't subject to the central bank measures so it has become an alternative that importers are willing to pay a premium for,"" says Zimbabwean technology analyst Nigel Gambanga, pointing to a rise in businesses accepting the currency as payment.   Bitcoin also offers investors a refuge from the faltering formal economy.  ""When confidence in national currencies wavers because of monetary policy or political uncertainty, bitcoin often behaves as a safe haven because the price is totally based on market discovery,"" says Nolan Bauerle, director of research at news site CoinDesk.  ""Some people find bitcoin useful because it is immune from the bright ideas of centralized authorities and their unintended consequences.""  Test case Even before the current crisis, Zimbabwe offered favorable conditions for bitcoin adoption.   The country ranks third on the Bitcoin Market Potential Index, created by economic historian Dr. Garrick Hileman of the University of Cambridge, just behind the inflation-plagued economies of Argentina and Venezuela.  The Index cites Zimbabwe's vast informal economy and history of financial crises as key factors that could drive bitcoin adoption.  But while Zimbabwe's conditions are unique, digital currency experts believe it offers a valuable test case for the viability of bitcoin on a national scale, which could have global implications.   ""The underlying takeaway is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and have a place in the world where monetary policy and fiat currencies cannot be trusted,"" says Saxo Bank analyst Kay Van-Petersen.  ""It's only a matter of time before an emerging or frontier market government decides to adopt a cryptocurrency as a foundation for credibility, transparency, accountability, and attraction of foreign capital.""   Beat them or join them?  Should the bitcoin surge continue, the market could come under pressure from Mugabe's authoritarian government.  ""I wouldn't expect any tolerance from a country with a fragile financial system trying to maintain capital controls,"" says Hileman, suggesting the Zimbabwean government might follow China's example of banning bitcoin exchanges.  But he questions whether the country has the resources to enforce such a ban, which could safeguard the currency's future.    Another possibility is the government could embrace a thriving market and seek to take advantage of it.   ""If trade in bitcoin intensifies with no resolution to the country's currency woes, we could witness the central bank and government revise its position by taking on a more active role in cryptocurrency trading,"" says Gambanga. ""At the very least, (by) recognizing cryptocurrencies through some form of regulation."" The analyst even raises the prospect of bitcoin becoming an official currency of Zimbabwe.   ""The state has already taken extreme measures like banning the importation of fruits,"" he says. ""So adding bitcoin to the country's multi-currency basket might not be so absurd.""   "

Hackers tied to Kim Jong Un's regime stole blueprints and other information about warships and submarines last year when they broke into one of the world's biggest shipbuilders, according to South Korean lawmaker Kyeong Dae-soo.   Blueprints, shipbuilding technology, weapons systems and test data related to submarines and destroyers were among roughly 60 classified military documents taken from Daewoo Shipbuilding last year, according to Kyeong's office. It said it was summarizing information it had received from the South Korean Defense Ministry and several military agencies.   The hackers are believed to have accessed some 40,000 documents in all.   Kyeong, a member of the opposition party, learned of the Daewoo hack at an intelligence briefing last week, according to a spokesman for the lawmaker. The South Korean Defense Ministry declined to comment on the matter, but said it is working to strengthen military security.   Related: North Korea's long history of hacking   Daewoo has built several South Korean warships and submarines, all part of the country's defenses against North Korea.   A Daewoo spokeswoman declined to comment, beyond saying that the company is looking into the matter.   The Daewoo hack is the latest case to come to light suggesting North Korea is using its hacking abilities to try to gain an edge in the tense standoff with the U.S. and its allies over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.   Earlier this month, another South Korean lawmaker revealed that North Korean hackers allegedly stole classified military documents from a Defense Ministry database. Among the documents stolen were a South Korea-U.S. wartime operation plan and a document that included procedures to ""decapitate"" North Korean leadership.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   North Korean hackers have also been tied to other high profile cyberattacks, including the massive ransomware attack WannaCry earlier this year, a series of attacks on global banks that came to light last year and the hacking of Sony Pictures in 2014.   The North Korean government has repeatedly denied involvement in international cyberattacks.   Cybersecurity experts say the latest alleged heist shows the risks for government contractors.

Companies ""involved in state activities like defense are considered fair game by cyber spies,"" he said. "

But soon, students and other schools around Flathead County were receiving threatening messages, too. More than 30 schools in the district shutdown for three days.   ""The messages weren't pleasant messages,"" Bradshaw said. ""They were 'splatter kids' blood in the hallways,' and things like that.""   The U.S. Department of Education is now warning teachers, parents, and K-12 education staff of a cyberthreat targeting school districts across the country.   So far, at least three states have been targeted by the extortion attempt from hackers asking schools to give them money or the group will release stolen private records, according to the department.   ""In some cases, this has included threats of violence, shaming, or bullying the children unless payment is received,"" the department wrote in an advisory this week.   Bradshaw, the superintendent of schools in Columbia Falls, Montana said a hacking group broke into multiple school servers and stole personal information on students and possibly staff. He said after the threatening messages came, hackers asked for ransom.   In a ransom note sent to a number of Columbia Falls school district members and released by the county's sheriff's department, the hacking group called the Dark Overlord threatened the district and demanded up to $150,000 in bitcoin to destroy the stolen private data.   The threatening letter talked about use of force, mentioned the name ""Sandy Hook,"" the elementary school in Connecticut where 20 small children and six adults were shot dead, and said victims would suffer financial and reputational damage.   Law enforcement said they did not believe the threats and determined the attackers were located outside of the U.S.   ""We feel this is important to allow our community to understand that the threats were not real, and were simply a tactic used by the cyber extortionists to facilitate their demand for money,"" the Flathead County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post last month.   Bradshaw said the district is not paying the ransom, and he is still receiving threatening messages.   Related: The U.S. Army is teaching kids how to hack at DEF CON   The same hackers also targeted the Johnson Community School District in Iowa earlier this month, and the district canceled all classes on October 3. According to local media reports, the hackers also sent threatening text messages to children and their parents.   The hacking group previously attempted to extort Netflix (NFLX) after hacking its production studio, Larson Studios. The group released episodes of Orange is the New Black online last spring.   It's unclear why the Dark Overlord began targeting schools but someone from the hacking group told the Daily Beast they are ""escalating the intensity of our strategy in response to the FBI's persistence in persuading clients away from us.""   The Department of Education says the hackers are probably targeting districts ""with weak data security, or well-known vulnerabilities that enable the attackers to gain access to sensitive data."" It advises districts to conduct security audits and patch vulnerable systems, train staff on data security best practices, and review sensitive data to make sure no outside actors can access it.   According to Mary Kavaney, the chief operating officer of the Global Cyber Alliance, school environments often don't have a lot of technology resources dedicated to security, but have some of the richest personal information on people, including social security numbers, birth dates, and, potentially, medical and financial information.   ""If bad actors can access student [personal data], that information can be exploited for the purpose of fraud and committing crimes for years before it is detected,"" Kavaney says. ""It's often only upon application for a job, or application for financial aid to attend college that students find out that their social security number has been used fraudulently -- they may have poor credit due to false applications against their history, or worse, find that crime has been committed in their name.""   Bradshaw says the ordeal has been stressful and troubling. Because the district hasn't paid the hackers, they're still threatening to release the data online.

324,324,DOJ indicts two Chinese nationals in fentanyl trafficking case,http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/18/politics/doj-chinese-nationals-fentanyl-trafficking/index.html,"Oct 19, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is taking its war on drugs worldwide. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the first-of-its-kind indictment against two Chinese nationals who were allegedly manufacturing and trafficking to the US fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, substances that can be 50 times as potent as heroin. According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in 2016. The Chinese nationals were using the Internet and dark web to sell fentanyl to US customers, many of whom were too inexperienced or unaware to realize they were buying the highly pure substance, Rosenstein told reporters Tuesday. ""They use multiple identities to disguise their activities and their shipments and to obscure the trail of profits going back to China,"" Rosenstein said. ""They take advantage of the fact that the fentanyl molecule can be altered in numerous ways to create a fentanyl analogue that is not listed as illegal under US or Chinese law. When regulators are able to identify the new fentanyl and make it illegal, the distributors quickly switch to a new, unlisted fentanyl analogue.""  Investigators tracked down the two Chinese defendants, Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, and the chemical plants they operated in China after a series of local law enforcement crackdowns in Mississippi and North Dakota, according to the indictment. A routine traffic stop in Mississippi in 2013 first unearthed a domestic drug ring tied to Yan. The ring sold synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids, commonly known as ""spice"" or ""bath salts,"" and delivered the products through parcel delivery services, according to the Justice Department. Yan allegedly operated websites advertising the deadly fentanyl and sold it directly to customers in several cities around the country, Rosenstein said.   Zhang was pinpointed in the wake of the death of an 18-year-old who died after a fentanyl overdose in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Federal agents identified another Grand Forks resident as the source of the fentanyl, and discovered that the buyer had used crypto-currency Bitcoin to buy the drugs over the Internet for more than a year, ""using an encrypted website on the Dark Web,"" Rosenstein said. Prosecutors were eventually able to trace the drugs to Zhang's distribution network in China.  Five Canadian citizens, two residents of Florida, and one resident of New Jersey were also indicted in connection with Zhang's drug ring on charges of conspiracy to distribute the drugs in at least 11 states, according to the Justice Department. The indictments were announced after President Donald Trump's nominee for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, withdrew his name from consideration for the position. The withdrawal came amid fallout from a joint investigation by The Washington Post and CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that revealed Marino took nearly $100,000 from the pharmaceutical lobby while sponsoring legislation that made it easier for drug companies to distribute opioids, but also thwarted the Drug Enforcement Agency's efforts. Rosenstein said DOJ will review the law, but didn't say whether it should be repealed. ""I'm very concerned about it,"" he said. ""I've talked to the attorney general about it. We're going to review it.""  "

326,326,Why the world should worry about North Korea's cyber weapons,http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/asia/north-korea-technological-capabilities/index.html,"Oct 11, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)North Korea's hackers have been accused of carrying out some of the most audacious cyber attacks of the past few years, from siphoning millions of dollars to stealing state secrets. Analysts say cyber capabilities have become a key asset in North Korea's war chest, used for a wide range of purposes including hacking adversaries like South Korea and pilfering  money.  Pyonyang's increasingly bold attacks in the virtual space have come in tandem with the hermit nation's rapidly progressing ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  ""North Korea's cyber weapons are as destructive as its conventional weapons,"" Lim Jong-in, a cyber security professor at Korea University, told CNN. ""Tomahawk missiles can paralyze a major country's power grid and financial system. So do North Korea's cyber weapons."" In the latest revelation, a member of the South Korean ruling party said Tuesday that North Korea stole classified military documents from a South Korean Defense Ministry database in September 2016. They included a document that included plans to ""decapitate"" the North Korean leadership. And cybersecurity firm FireEye said Tuesday that it detected and stopped an attack on US electric companies by people with links to the North Korean government.  The hackers' skill is all the more surprising considering they come from a reclusive country where internet use is heavily restricted. Inside North Korea, citizens only have access to a government-run, heavily censored intranet rather than the full depths of the world wide web. But that hasn't stopped its hackers from becoming some of the best in the business.  ""North Korea almost certainly has the capability to conduct disruptive and potentially destructive attacks, as well as more traditional cyber espionage operations,"" Bryce Boland, the chief technology officer for Asia-Pacific at FireEye, told CNN. How big a security threat is North Korean hacking? North Korea's cyber capabilities are yet another dangerous arrow in a quiver that includes chemical weapons, nuclear warheads and the world's fourth-largest standing army.   ""Cyber experts say North Korea should be ranked among the top 5 in the world. I believe North Korea can steal anything they want through cyber espionage. No country is safe from its cyber espionage,"" Lim said. South Korea said in December that Pyongyang had broken into the South Korean military intranet and leaked confidential information. South Korea has strong cyber security defenses, but North Korea's isolation gives it an unexpected advantage, Boland said. ""North Korea has little connectivity and relatively limited reliance on technology, making it less vulnerable to attacks,"" he said. And the latest revelations from South Korea allege that North Korean hackers stole some 235 gigabytes worth of data, including a joint South Korea-US wartime operational plan. ""If the North Koreans in fact accessed the US/South Korean defense plans, this is a treasure trove of information and presents a real danger,"" said CNN military analyst Lt Col Rick Francona. ""The only good thing about it is that we know that it happened and when. That at least allows us to do damage control -- mitigate the damage done to national security."" What tactics do they use? Boland said spear phishing -- messages which appear to be from a trusted source or about a topic specific to the person being targeted but in fact conceal malware or another way for a hacker to attempt to gain access to computers -- is a favorite tactic of the North Koreans.  ""Once the victim organization has been comprised, we see additional tools being deployed,"" he said.  Another tactic they've been caught using, Boland said, is called a ""watering hole attack."" That involves compromising websites that people visit and placing weaponized content there for them to click. Top South Korean government officials' smartphones were also hacked in 2016, according to the country's spy agency. Seoul accused North Korea of stealing text messages and voice communications by ""sending enticing text messages."" Pyongyang is also suspected of turning 60,000 computers in South Korea into ""zombies,"" or computers that have been compromised by hackers and can then be used for cyberattacks. South Korea's spy agency estimated that Pyongyang took control of 10,000 computers in a single month in 2015. Whatever the type of attack, North Korea will conduct reconnaissance and research ahead of time and tailor it to the specific organization or victim they're targeting, Boland told CNN.  How do they operate?  Child prodigies are sought from a young age and recruited, according to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean defector who worked as a computer science professor in Pyongyang before escaping in 2004. The country has established about 250 elite schools for computer education, Kim told CNN Wednesday. From there, authorities select 500 of the most talented students for even more advanced training in cyber combat at two schools in Pyongyang. Once their studies are done, some are assigned to cyber units for hands-on training. Others end up working in places like Shenyang, China, where a secret network of hackers called ""Bureau 121"" operates, Kim explained. Kim, in a 2015 interview with CNN's Will Ripley, said Shenyang offers hackers good internet infrastructure and the ability for North Koreans to work secretly. However, a recent move by Russia to provide North Korea a new internet connection increases the bandwith available in country. According to FireEye's Boland, that also carries risks for the regime. ""It gives Russia a stake, influence in North Korea it didn't previously have. Russia can also track North Korea's internet to potentially identify the targets picked up by North Korea,"" he said. Previously, North Korean internet traffic was funneled through one sole link, provided by Chinese telecommunications firm China Unicom, according to experts. Who does North Korea target? Whatever the methods are, North Korea has been accused of some of the most damaging hacking operations of the 21st century. They include the Sony hack of 2014, in which servers were brought down, movies were leaked and a trove of emails, Social Security numbers and employee salaries were released. The finger was pointed at North Korea due to the fact that Sony was about to release ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.   In February 2016, $101 million was fraudulently transferred out of the Bangladesh central bank's account at the New York Federal Reserve and eventually made its way to the Philippines.  Researchers found that the hackers responsible for the theft carefully routed their signal through France, South Korea and Taiwan to setup their attack server, but made a critical mistake that established a connection to North Korea.  Most of the funds have not been recovered. Analysts say North Korea has been preparing similar operations targeting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as international sanctions make it harder for North Korea to use the dollar. UK and US intelligence agencies also linked this year's WannaCry cyber attack to North Korea.  CNN's Taehoon Lee, Yazhou Sun, Sherisse Pham and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report"

Russian state-owned company TransTeleCom has provided a new internet connection to Kim Jong Un's regime, according to North Korea monitoring project 38 North.

""This new link means two companies would have to cut business to cut the country off,"" said Martyn Williams, who wrote about the news for 38 North and runs the website North Korea Tech. ""As TransTeleCom just started under the current situation, it's presumably not too worried about doing business.""   TransTeleCom said in a brief statement to CNN that it has telecommunications links with North Korea under a deal signed in 2009. It didn't elaborate.   Related: North Korea's long history of hacking   The new internet connection also boosts North Korea's cybersecurity strength.   ""By increasing the number of internet connections in and out of the country, it increases its resilience to attacks,"" said Bryce Boland, cybersecurity expert with FireEye.   News of the Russian support comes after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Cyber Command carried out an operation attacking hackers affiliated with North Korea's military spy agency over the weekend.   North Korea is also believed by cybersecurity experts to have been behind a number of high-profile attacks, including on Sony Pictures and global banks.  This is a modal window.     With Russia involved in North Korea's internet, things could get more complicated. Attacks against North Korean hackers or computer servers could now travel through Russia's internet infrastructure.

328,328,Trump gives 'final warning' on North Korea trade. What comes next?,http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/22/news/economy/north-korea-trump-china-trade-sanctions/index.html,"Sep 22, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   President Trump on Thursday gave the Treasury Department more power than ever to punish people and businesses who trade with North Korea. The big questions are how and when it will be used.   ""They certainly have enough evidence to move forward with these kinds of sanctions,"" said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""It looks like they were interested in providing one little final warning, especially to China.""   Trump has been pushing China to use its deep economic ties with North Korea to pressure Kim Jong Un's regime to back down from developing nuclear weapons. China is estimated to account for roughly 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, with money and goods flowing back and forth across a land border that runs for 880 miles.   On Friday, China announced it would limit its exports of refined petroleum products to North Korea beginning in October 1 to comply with U.N. resolutions.   The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that exports of condensate oil, liquefied natural gas as well as textile imports from the North are currently prohibited.   Related: North Korea sanctions: Here's what Trump did      Even though China has supported a series of tough U.N. resolutions this year targeting a growing portion of North Korea's economy, many experts are skeptical that Chinese officials and companies are fully applying the sanctions.   That's where the new powers Trump gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin come in. They enable him to cut off access to the U.S. financial system and freeze the assets of any company or individual doing business with North Korea, measures known as secondary sanctions.   Those are serious threats for major Chinese banks, which had $142 billion of assets in the U.S. at the end of March, according to the Federal Reserve. U.S. dollars are the lifeblood of the global financial system and banks operating internationally need easy access to them.   ""We are about to run the most significant experiment in the use of secondary sanctions on North Korea to date, and perhaps the most significant such experiment with respect to any country ever,"" wrote Stephan Haggard, a North Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego.  This is a modal window.        The executive order that Trump signed Thursday is likely to have set off alarm bells around the globe.   ""Every single big bank in the world has sent or will be sending a memo to their compliance teams,"" Haggard said. ""Those teams in turn will be scrambling to figure out if they have any North Korea risk.""   But it's uncertain exactly how Chinese banks will respond.   Earlier this month, China ordered its financial institutions to take a number of steps to comply with past U.N. resolutions, including halting business with sanctioned individuals and companies. And employees at some major Chinese banks told CNNMoney that they were no longer opening new accounts for any North Koreans.   Related: Will latest U.N. sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat?      Those measures did not go far enough for Trump.   The North Korean regime is believed to use a complex network of front companies to do business in China and other countries to dodge sanctions. Trump's new order has put the onus on banks and other firms to find out whether the businesses they're dealing with have any kind of North Korean connection.   Banks that may have previously looked the other way now have a strong incentive to pay close attention or risk severe punishment. If they all begin cutting off business with North Korea, the impact would be felt immediately.   ""It's something that the North Koreans have never really faced before,"" said Ruggiero, a former official at the State and Treasury departments who specialized in financial sanctions and weapons proliferation issues.  This is a modal window.        But the new U.S. measures still come with limitations.   Experts say cutting off a major Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system could have unforeseen consequences, such as a chain reaction of defaults that could ripple through the world's second largest economy and beyond. Beijing, which has strongly opposed sanctions against its companies, could retaliate against U.S. interests.   Ruggiero said there are still less drastic measures available, such as slapping a big fine on a high-profile Chinese bank to deter others.   ""I certainly don't rule out that this administration could decide that a North Korean nuclear weapon on an ICBM is a big enough threat to overrule the concerns that [crippling sanctions on a big Chinese bank] could harm both economies and crack the trade relationship,"" he said. ""But...there are things that can be done before getting there.""      Other factors could also blunt the effectiveness of the new U.S. measures.   There may be smaller Chinese banks and firms dealing with Kim's regime that have little or no exposure to the U.S. financial system, Haggard said. North Korea is also believed to have an array of illicit revenue sources, such as cyberattacks, drugs and weapons.   ""If the sanctions don't have the anticipated effect, it could be because North Korea has a... parallel universe of banks and firms that simply are immune"" to the executive order, Haggard wrote.

I am in Chengdu, China this week attending the 22nd Summit of the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Again, I am struck by the sheer size and scale of this country, a fact so often not understood by people in the West.   Chengdu is a city of 15 million people, according to the latest census numbers. That makes it twice as big as London or New York City. Incredibly, Chengdu is only China's fourth largest city behind Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai. Oh yes, I mustn't forget, Chengdu is also home to the giant pandas, which I was fortunate enough to see.    Here in Chengdu, the chairman of the China National Tourism Administration outlined the government's plans to extend its Belt & Road Initiative deep into the field of tourism. More than 60 countries spanning Asia, Africa, Eurasia and Europe have signed up to the initiative that has the Chinese spending billions of dollars developing three land routes and one maritime routes along the old Silk Road.   Now ask yourself: What initiative is the West putting forward for the future to cement its leadership? I don't see any grand plan from the EU for the rest of this century, in terms of cementing trade relations.

Whether Belt & Road reaches its full potential really isn't my point. It's the very fact that there is leadership, which others can enjoin, that should give Western leaders pause for thought.

333,333,North Korea still making millions from small arms exports,http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/14/news/north-korea-small-arms-trade/index.html,"Sep 14, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The country is one of the world's major illicit exporters of small arms and light weapons, according to a new report by the Small Arms Survey at the Geneva Graduate Institute.   ""The report provides some information that helps to support assumptions that North Korea is an important source of supply for small arms, ammunition and production equipment and know-how, but we still do not have a comprehensive picture of its activities,"" said Paul Holtom, one of the authors of the report.   Alongside North Korea, the report also singled out Iran and Saudi Arabia for their opaque dealings in small arms, a murky industry worth an estimated $6 billion.   Given the secrecy, experts have to rely heavily on weapons seizures to assess the volume of trade.   In Egypt, officials intercepted 132 tons of arms cargo, including roughly 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades, hidden on a North Korean ship in August 2016.   Back in 2009, 10 containers of North Korean weapons, including rocket launchers, were seized from a cargo plane in Thailand. That arms cache alone would have fetched an estimated $18 million, according to the report.     Related: Will latest U.N. sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat?    Data from arms seizures ""coupled with other documented small arms trade activities, are sufficient to justify North Korea's status as a major small arms exporter,"" according to the Geneva researchers.   Citing research from the United Nations, their report documented a dozen other recent seizures of illicit North Korean cargo destined for Iran, Syria and Cuba, estimating some of those to be worth at least $10 million.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   The report also names the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Namibia and Yemen as clients of the rogue state. Those countries had received assistance from North Korea in developing small arms and ammunition factories, it said.   The United Nations expanded sanctions against North Korea to include small arms back in 2009. The country is also prohibited from trading in light weapons ammunition and certain minerals and metals.   North Korea's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program resulted in a fresh round of U.N. sanctions, designed to squeeze the country harder than ever. "

Analysts say the axed channels provided vital information that helped them follow the movements of Kim Jong Un, advances in North Korea's weapons programs and other important developments.   ""Basically, this hurts efforts to track activities of interest in a closed country -- at the worst possible time,"" tweeted Joshua Pollack, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.   Tensions between North Korea and the U.S. have spiked this year as Kim's regime advanced its nuclear weapons program and President Trump responded with fiery rhetoric.  Hey, @Google / @YouTube. We have a problem. Please restore North Korea-related channels ASAP. They're primary sources for researchers.    The shuttered YouTube channels played clips from state TV and other North Korean content.   One channel run by Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean government propaganda website, had racked up millions of views. It was ""terminated due to a legal complaint,"" according to a short message posted by YouTube.   Videos published on Uriminzokkiri's channel have made headlines around the world, including one in 2013 that appeared to show an imagined missile attack on U.S. government buildings in Washington.   North Korea analysts have studied all kinds of footage put out by the channels, searching for clues about missiles and other military hardware. The videos also help them understand what the North Korean regime is telling its people -- and what messages it might be trying to send to foreign governments.   ""These North Korean videos are ... indispensable sources of information for us on the outside,"" Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an open letter Tuesday to Google (GOOGL), YouTube's parent company.   Melvin told CNNMoney that the closure of Uriminzokkiri and a second channel -- Tonpomail -- represented a ""serious loss."" Tonpomail was controlled by ethnic Koreans in Japan who are loyal to Pyongyang, he said.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   YouTube declined to give a full explanation for taking down the accounts.   ""We love that YouTube is a powerful platform for documenting events and shining light on dark corners around the world, but we must comply with the law,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We disable accounts that repeatedly violate our community guidelines or terms of service and when we are required by law to do so.""   The researchers pointed out that the channels didn't carry ads so they weren't making money for the North Korean regime, which has been hit with waves of international sanctions aiming to cut off its sources of income.  This is a modal window.     Melvin suggested YouTube's actions could be the result of a U.S. executive order targeting the property of persons identified by the Treasury Department as having links to the North Korean government.   ""If Google closed the YouTube accounts under this provision, then this is a case of regulations being written so broadly that they hit and destroy assets that are actually important to the U.S. policy community,"" he wrote.   This isn't the first time YouTube has killed channels related to the North Korean government. It closed down a state TV account in November, which was reported to have been making money from advertising.   Related: Will the latest U.N. sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat?   YouTube's actions in recent days have added to the confusion.   It initially suspended Uriminzokkiri and several other channels on Friday, saying they had violated ""community guidelines."" Then it reinstated them over the weekend before taking some of them down again Tuesday.   North Korean propaganda footage is still available on other YouTube channels -- and on Chinese video sites like Youku. But the loss of a major source such as Uriminzokkiri still has consequences for experts.   ""Even if the proprietors of the channels find other outlets, crucial research archives are now gone,"" Pollack said.   -- Sara Ashley O'Brien contributed to this report. "

Bitcoin and other forms of virtual money -- known as cryptocurrencies -- appeal to North Korea as the U.S. pursues international sanctions aimed at further isolating the country, according to a new report from FireEye.   ""Sanctions against North Korea are likely to fuel their cybercrime activity,"" said Bryce Boland, Singapore-based chief technology officer with FireEye. ""Attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges can be a great vehicle to obtain what is ultimately hard currency.""   Related: North Korea's long history of hacking   It's just the latest example of the illicit ways North Korea allegedly brings in money as it endures wave after wave of increasingly tough international sanctions over its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program.   FireEye says it has identified three attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges that took place between May and July, all of them linked to North Korean hackers. The spike in activity began soon after the U.S. said it planned to ratchet up sanctions against North Korea.   With fresh U.N. sanctions and bitcoin's skyrocketing value, ""the potential windfall from these attacks has risen accordingly,"" Boland said.   A single bitcoin is currently worth more than $4,300, up from less than $1,000 at the start of the year.   Related: Bitcoin has doubled in value in a month. Here's why   FireEye identified the North Korean group behind the bitcoin attacks as TEMP.Hermit. Other security firms have linked the group to past high-profile cyberattacks, including the hacking of Sony Pictures in 2014.   Hackers tied to North Korea are also suspected of carrying out a series of attacks on global banks that came to light last year. They included a cyberheist on Bangladesh's central bank in which tens of millions of dollars were stolen.   The North Korean government has repeatedly denied involvement in international cyberattacks.   Intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts have also linked North Korea to WannaCry, the biggest cyberattack the world has ever seen. The WannaCry virus initially demanded victims pay a ransom in bitcoin, yielding more than $140,000.   Related: Someone has emptied the ransom accounts from the WannaCry attack   Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often held in accounts at online exchanges. But FireEye points out that hackers can swap them into other, more anonymous cryptocurrencies -- or move them elsewhere and eventually withdraw them in traditional currencies like South Korean won or U.S. dollars.   North Korean hackers have previously targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing bitcoin worth $88,000 (at the time) between 2013 and 2015, according to Yonhap News, which cited South Korean cybersecurity firm Hauri.

Dimon said at an investment conference that the digital currency was a ""fraud"" and that his firm would fire anyone at the bank that traded it ""in a second.""   Dimon, speaking at a Barclays investment conference Tuesday, said he supported blockchain technology for tracking payments but that trading bitcoin itself was against the bank's rules. He added that bitcoin was ""stupid"" and ""far too dangerous.""   Bitcoin prices fell slightly -- about 2% -- on Tuesday following Dimon's remarks. But the price of one bitcoin is still up an astonishing 335% this year. One bitcoin is currently worth about $4,115.   Dimon warned that bitcoin prices will remain very volatile and could be hurt if countries crack down on their use, as China has recently done.   In fact, the price of a bitcoin has fallen about 10% in the past week on worries about more regulations in China.   ""It won't end well,"" Dimon said, adding that ""they will eventually blow up. It's a fraud.""   Dimon also alluded to the fact that bitcoins have been associated with criminal activities as well.   He said there could be a market for bitcoins if you were dealing with North Korea, which has reportedly asked for bitcoin as a ransom payment during several cyberattacks, or drug dealers in Venezuela and Ecuador.   Speaking later in the day at a different event, the Delivering Alpha conference, Dimon joked that just because prices were going up now didn't mean they would do so forever.

The new measures target major goods that North Korea buys and sells, but they don't go as far as the U.S. wanted. A ban on oil exports to North Korea was dropped from Monday's U.N. resolution. Now it calls only for a reduction.   That was the result of opposition from China and Russia, which are wary of putting too much economic pressure on North Korea.   ""The Chinese and Russians are only willing to accept sanctions with loopholes in them that allow China and Russia to dictate how strong they really are,"" said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.   Analysts said doubts remain over how tightly Beijing, Moscow and others will enforce the latest measures. And President Trump appeared skeptical about their effectiveness, describing the U.N. vote as ""another very small step.""   ""I don't know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15 to nothing vote,"" Trump said Tuesday during a meeting with the Malaysian prime minister. ""But those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.""   Related: UN passes fresh sanctions on North Korea      China, which is estimated to account for roughly 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, has been repeatedly criticized by experts for not doing enough to implement previous U.N. sanctions.   The new limits on oil highlight the difficulties involved. The U.N. resolution caps the amount of crude oil sold to North Korea each year at 4 million barrels.   But China, which sends crude oil to its smaller neighbor through a pipeline, stopped disclosing the amount it ships more than three years ago.   ""How would we know if China is limiting crude oil exports if it doesn't report the data to begin with?"" asked Kent Boydston, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.   Related: North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest   A recent report by a U.N. panel of experts also found flaws in the enforcement of existing sanctions. It estimated that North Korea managed to export at least $270 million of banned commodities between February and August.      In order to pressure Beijing and Moscow to do more, the U.S. has to go after more companies and individuals that are suspected of doing business with the North Korean regime, according to Ruggiero.   The Trump administration has already made some moves this year, hitting a Chinese bank and other Chinese and Russian entities with sanctions. But Ruggiero, a former official at the State and Treasury departments, has called for the U.S. to go further by slapping a big fine on a notable Chinese bank.   ""The one factor working in favor of these sanctions being implemented is that the Chinese and Russians have to be fearful that the U.S. will impose its own sanctions on Chinese and Russian companies,"" he said.   Related: Trump's plan to starve North Korea of oil is a long shot   The U.S. is in a race against time, with North Korea having carried out a string of missile launches in recent weeks and its biggest ever nuclear test.   ""It does sound like U.S. patience is running out,"" Ruggiero said. ""I'm not sure how much time they're going to give China to implement a resolution like this.""      Even if China and Russia do fully enforce the latest sanctions, there's still considerable doubt about whether the stranglehold will force Kim to rethink the development of North Korea's nuclear weapons.   Experts have repeatedly warned that Kim's regime will protect the weapons program above all else. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to agree with that view.   ""They will eat grass but they will not turn away from the path that will provide for their security,"" he said of North Koreans last week.   Related: U.S. official: 'People need to isolate North Korea'   The reduction in oil sales to North Korea isn't expected to change Kim's calculus.   The measure is unlikely to have a significant impact on the North Korean military or nuclear weapons program, according to a report Tuesday by the Nautilus Institute, a think tank that specializes in energy issues.   ""Primarily these sanctions will affect the civilian population whose oil product uses are of lower priority to the [North Korean] state,"" the report said. "

As Grant Reid, CEO of the historically media shy Mars Inc., told me, ""We're talking about uncommon collaboration.""   He says it's about ""hundreds of countries, thousands of companies, and billions of people -- taking that energy and doing it together.""   It remains to been seen if that energy will find a way to influence the Oval Office when it comes to DACA.   What's clear is that with greater force and more unity than ever before, executives are speaking up and speaking out.   They're testing their influence and tweaking their approach, well aware the road ahead is thorny and full of pitfalls.

If Congress doesn't pass a legislative fix, thousands of Dreamers will lose their jobs -- and major companies would lose talent. That's one reason Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) filed letters of support in a multistate lawsuit aiming to stop DACA's repeal. Rescinding DACA could also affect entire industries.

Human traffickers rely on the internet to advertise and maintain criminal enterprises. The Global Emancipation Network collects and analyzes the digital breadcrumbs they leave behind to help find victims and stop traffickers.   The organization uses data analytics to find, study, and make connections between people and the information they share online. With corporate partners including Microsoft (MSFT), Splunk, and Recorded Future, the volunteer-run organization has created a searchable database and tool to find and analyze trafficking data.   ""There has to be more that we can do to identify victims, rescue them, hope they don't get revictimized. And then to stop and punish those traffickers,"" said Sherrie Caltagirone, founder and executive director of GEN. ""Right now, they operate with impunity online.""   Their external platform, called Minerva, is currently in beta, and the plan is to eventually provide it free to law enforcement and victim service providers. It includes image processing, data analytics, bitcoin analysis, and public records enrichment. Police will be able to use it to search for things like advertisements, phone numbers, or websites traffickers use.   Internally, GEN uses the data it collects to look for patterns human trafficking and study global trends. There are tens of millions of people trafficked each year, and according to the International Labour Organization, 21 million people are victims of forced labor worldwide. The UN estimates children make up about a third of global trafficking victims.   There are currently a handful of nonprofits that use data to track human trafficking, including Thorn and the Polaris Project. Caltagirone says GEN is unique because it collects data about all types of human trafficking from 22 countries and 80 jurisdictions.   Related: Hacker creates organization to unmask child predators    GEN scrapes data from a variety of sources, including Craigslist, Backpage, and dark web sites.   Splunk, a data analysis platform and supporter of the organization, donated its technology to GEN. It can index the scraped information and look for suspicious signals in the data by analyzing keywords, phone numbers, geographic data, or usernames. For instance, ads are deemed suspicious if they contain the same phone number but pop up in two different states.   GEN's platform also studies the language used in advertising, including emoji or text embedded in images. One sign of an underage sex trafficking victim could be words like ""lolita"" and ""fresh"" in an advertisement. Studying language and data shared in ads also helps differentiate between posts from independent sex workers and those that are likely to be sex-trafficking victims.   Though her group analyzes all types of human trafficking, it is more difficult to spot labor trafficking than sex trafficking.   Andrew Lewman, vice president of OWL Cybersecurity, says human traffickers will frequently start on Facebook to advertise smuggling services, then switch to encrypted chat apps and use anonymity tools like Tor to protect communications and information.   ""One way traffickers uses the internet and darknet is to buy, sell, or coordinate people,"" Lewman said. Like any business, much of it relies on the web.   Lewman, who served on President Obama's tech and trafficking task force, provides GEN with indexes of data. The firm scrapes 400 million pages every few months, he says, most coming from the dark web, and shares that data with GEN. The organization or law enforcement can then run their own queries on it, like searching for ads or usernames from an investigation.   ""Some of the techniques we do we don't advertise, because we don't want traffickers to find out about it and stop doing the thing they're doing that allows us to find them,"" Caltagirone said.     Caltagirone, who has worked in anti-human trafficking her entire adult life, has spent hundreds of hours talking to law enforcement. She recently tested the platform with one U.S. District Attorney in an ongoing investigation of an escort review forum. The DA wanted a list of some users on the forum, what other sites they were on, what criminal activity they engaged in, and photos shared with their posts. Then law enforcement could cross-reference the usernames and phone numbers to other locations online.   The group has also studied whether or not site shutdowns -- a traditional law enforcement technique that makes a website inaccessible -- actually prevent bad behavior. Her organization studied web traffic data after Backpage closed its adult advertising section, and found that it doesn't. Users simply went elsewhere.   Ultimately the platform will be free to law enforcement, funded entirely by donations. Many jurisdictions don't have the budget to pay for technical tools, or have dedicated human trafficking units. Those are the clients Caltagirone wants to target first.   But beyond cash-strapped police departments, making the platform free is an ethical issue.   ""Trafficking victims have already had their lives destroyed, and they've already had people make ungodly sums of money off their exploitation,"" she said. ""We say the buck, literally, stops here.""

Here's why,http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/14/technology/bitcoin-price-rise-reasons/index.html,"Aug 14, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The price of bitcoin broke through $4,000 on Sunday, a new record, and has largely stayed above that level since, according to digital currency news site CoinDesk.   The dramatic price rise marks the latest milestone in bitcoin's stellar growth in 2017 -- it's already worth more than four times its value at the start of the year.   Experts say it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the latest jump, but they point to three factors that are helping to drive prices higher.      Bitcoin was wracked with uncertainty two weeks ago when the digital currency split into two -- the original bitcoin and a new, cheaper offshoot called Bitcoin Cash.   The new unit was created by a group of people who differed with the bitcoin community's view on how to make the currency easier to use.   The creation of Bitcoin Cash -- worth less than 10% of bitcoin -- appears to have gone smoothly, and that could be making bitcoin more attractive too. (Anyone who owns bitcoin also owns the same number of Bitcoin Cash units.)   ""The record-breaking price levels would seem to indicate money coming into the market that had been held back pending the uncertain outcome of a split of the bitcoin network,"" CoinDesk said.      The main advantage of Bitcoin Cash is its new software that allows quicker transactions. Bitcoin is also trying to increase transaction speed by tweaking its own software.   It's called ""Segregated Witness,"" a change in bitcoin's rules that would allow people to put more transactions on each block of code used to trade the digital currency.   SegWit2x, as it is also known, is set to roll out later this week.   ""It isn't fully clear what is driving the rally - although certainly SegWit2x is playing a leading part,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency website CryptoCompare.   ""Although there are uncertainties, this is an epochal moment in bitcoin's evolution and opens up [an] option for how it can grow,"" Hayter added.      Japan has a mixed history with bitcoin. The founder of one of the currency's top exchanges, Mt. Gox, was arrested by Japanese police in 2015 and is currently on trial in the country for embezzlement.   But the current bitcoin rally appears largely to be driven by users in Japan, who accounted for more than 40% of trading over the past 24 hours, according to CryptoCompare.   -- Selena Larson contributed reporting.

More than $140,000 worth of digital currency bitcoin has been drained from three accounts linked to the ransomware virus that hit hundreds of thousands of computers around the world in May.   It's unclear, though, who emptied the accounts and why. If the WannaCry hackers are finally trying to get their hands on the money, they'll have to outwit law enforcement agencies from around the globe.   It's a fresh twist in the mysterious attack that cybersecurity experts have linked to a hacking group associated with North Korea.   When the WannaCry virus started spreading through more than 150 countries -- infecting hospitals, businesses and government systems -- it demanded that victims pay a $300 ransom using bitcoin.   Related: Why ransomware costs small businesses big money   Bitcoin transactions and accounts are public, but they're also anonymous. The transfers from the WannaCry accounts late Wednesday first drew attention through the Twitter bot @actual_ransom, which was set up to monitor them.   The funds were moved from the three main accounts tied to WannaCry to nine other bitcoin accounts. If the hackers who carried out the cyberattack are moving the ransom money, they're almost certainly aware they're being watched.   Law enforcement officials will be on the alert, tracking where the bitcoin goes, according to Matthieu Suiche, founder of Comae Technologie. Essentially, investigators will be able to see a trail of digital breadcrumbs leading from account to account.   Related: Intelligence agencies link WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea   Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, declined to comment on the developments, saying the investigation into WannaCry is ongoing. The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular office hours.     In June, intelligence agencies tied the WannaCry attack to the Lazarus Group, an organization that researchers have linked to the North Korean government.   Melanie Shapiro, CEO of identity security firm Token, said the funds in the bitcoin accounts are probably being moved to make them less traceable.   ""We can watch all of this bitcoin be moved around, but inevitably every move makes it harder to trace back to an individual,"" she said.   Related: Bitcoin split in two, here's what that means   There are services called ""tumblers"" that let people break up funds into tiny transactions that are harder to trace, Shapiro noted.   For the time being, researchers and officials will be watching the new bitcoin accounts into which the money has been moved in order to track what happens to it next. "

After ongoing debates over how to scale the digital currency called bitcoin, some people have decided to make an entirely new currency called Bitcoin Cash.   It's a bit complicated for those who aren't in the bitcoin weeds. Essentially, political, technological, and ideological debates about growing bitcoin have come to a head. And some say that an entirely new currency called Bitcoin Cash could help scale bitcoin and bring it to the masses.   ""The course of the summer has been a battle between competing visions,"" said Zaki Manain, an independent cryptocurrency expert. This week the competition is playing out.   In order for bitcoin to become a simple global payment system for anyone to use, it needs to get over its growing pains. For some, the solution to that is to make a whole new currency using similar software.      Let's start with why scaling bitcoin is tough.   Bitcoin is built on something called a blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger containing all the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin. Transactions are added to ""blocks"" or the links of code that make up the chain, and each transaction must be recorded on a block. But these blocks are full, and it is slowing transactions way down.   Currently, there are an average of about 1,700 transactions that can be saved per bitcoin block, at about three transactions per second, Manain said. That's not very much. (Visa, for example, handles thousands of transactions every second.)   Because the bitcoin blockchain is becoming too congested, someone could pay for something with bitcoin, but it wouldn't be approved for hours.   Related: What is bitcoin?   The bitcoin community tried to solve this problem by implementing a rule change to its software. Called ""Segregated Witness,"" the rule change would let people put more transactions on each block. This, in technical terms, is called a ""soft fork,"" and would not result in an entirely new cryptocurrency. The new rule is supposed be enacted this month.   For some, this was not enough. That's where Bitcoin Cash comes in.      The creation of Bitcoin Cash is what is called a ""hard fork."" The creators are releasing a completely new software that allows for eight times the number of transactions per block. This means Bitcoin Cash could process transactions faster.   Bitcoin Cash is not worth the same as bitcoin. As of this writing, a unit of Bitcoin Cash is valued around $240, but one Bitcoin is worth more than $2,700.   Like bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash relies on the community. It will only be successful if people decide en masse to create the blocks for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. The first block was created Tuesday afternoon EST.      Anyone who owns bitcoin will also own the same number of Bitcoin Cash units. However, not all bitcoin exchanges (where people store their bitcoin) will accept Bitcoin Cash, and that could potentially hinder the widespread adoption of the new digital currency.   And in order for Bitcoin Cash to be used for mainstream transactions like buying coffee, businesses will have to accept it, regardless of whether they already accept bitcoin or not.   ""This will be informative for how we deal with these systems in the future,"" Manain said. ""Without a doubt this is going to be a blueprint, and we are going to learn a lot from this process."" "
346,346,Ransomware: A malicious gift that keeps on giving,http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/28/us/ransomware-overview-declassified/index.html,"Jul 28, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)Large-scale ransomware attacks will continue, and they'll likely get worse, experts warn. Ransomware, you may remember, is a nasty computer virus designed to hold data hostage until you pay a specific fee.  Massive attacks this year have amounted to a wake-up call for some about the dangers of ransomware. Extorted companies lose productivity, and people's health may be at risk if ransomware targets hospitals.   Last February, officials at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles said they paid the Bitcoin equivalent of $17,000 to cybercriminals after patient and doctor records were locked for almost two weeks. The hospital says it had to resort to handwriting to cope with the computer lockdown. ""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,"" said Allen Stefanek, president of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, in a statement. ""In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this."" A huge attack in May that spread around the world and hit more than 300,000 machines in over 150 companies was blamed on ransomware. Hospitals, major companies and government offices were among those that were affected.  Another attack in June, initially suspected of being ransomware, affected dozens of Ukrainian, Russian, European and American firms. Researchers later determined that the attack, nicknamed NotPetya, was a sophisticated virus, but not ransomware. Spy games? Experts say, there also may be a bit of cloak-and-dagger involved in all this. The May attack was blamed on malware called WannaCry, which targeted businesses running outdated Windows machines or people who didn't update their software. It leveraged an exploit -- a tool designed to take advantage of a security hole -- leaked in a batch of hacking tools believed to belong to the ultra-secret National Security Agency. The NSA and other spy agencies are known to develop high-powered hacking tools for intelligence gathering or law enforcement.  But under current laws, they don't have to report the flaws to the company at risk.  Some privacy advocates say that if the NSA had disclosed the vulnerability when it was first discovered, the outbreak may have been prevented. The NSA did not respond to CNN's request this week for comment.  Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who exposed the broad scope of NSA surveillance in 2013, tweeted, ""If @NSAGov had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they *found* it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened."" Security researchers say firms that fail to keep their software up to date are also responsible for the ransomware outbreak. The organizations involved in the May incident had two months to update their Microsoft products, which would have protected their systems. But the problem is, many companies are still at risk because they don't patch their systems. Companies don't patch for a variety of reasons: their machines don't support the patch, it's too expensive to do it, it might disrupt their services or they simply forget about an outdated computer on their network. Security patches are free -- but there is a cost in the employee time required to apply the patches -- also the cost of dealing with service interruptions, and fixing problems that are triggered because of the new system. In addition, sometimes new software doesn't work with older software or older machines. Large-scale ransomware attacks will continue to happen because businesses still have holes in their systems and because government-grade hacking tools are widely available, said Jon DiMaggio, a threat intelligence researcher at global security company Symantec. ""We now have these elite weapons that can be used by pretty much anyone,"" DiMaggio said. For some, Ransomware may seem like a new problem, but it's not. It's been around since at least 1989, according to Symantec. One potential fallback solution to prevent losing computer files forever is to make digital copies periodically.  Individuals, companies, and government agencies -- if they're careful and diligent -- do make backups regularly.  But even this option doesn't always work, because if a computer system is connected to a backup when it is infected with ransomware, the virus could spread to the backup as well. What the FBI says you should do But the FBI says if your computer is infected, do not pay ransomware. ""Paying a ransom doesn't guarantee an organization that it will get its data back -- we've seen cases where organizations never got a decryption key after having paid the ransom, said FBI Cyber Division Assistant Director James Trainor. ""Paying a ransom not only emboldens current cyber criminals to target more organizations, it also offers an incentive for other criminals to get involved in this type of illegal activity,"" he said. ""... by paying a ransom, an organization might inadvertently be funding other illicit activity associated with criminals."" CNN's David Fitzpatrick and Drew Griffin contributed to this report. "

Cybersecurity experts believe it was sabotage, not cash, that may have motivated the hackers behind this week's crippling global cyberattack.   Initial reports suggested the virus that surfaced on Tuesday was a form of ransomware, which demands a payment from victims before restoring their computer files.   But clues in the computer code now point to sabotage.   The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that its experts have uncovered ""evidence that questions initial judgments that the intention was to collect a ransom.""   ""We are investigating ... whether the intent was to disrupt rather than for any financial gain,"" the agency said in a statement.   Private sector experts are investigating along similar lines.   Cybersecurity firms Kaspersky Lab and Comae Technologies said the virus was likely spread by a sophisticated actor that wasn't interested in collecting a ransom.   ""To launch this attack, its authors have carefully created a destructive malware disguised as ransomware,"" Kaspersky said Friday. ""While some parts of this destructive malware still operate as original building blocks, meaning they might be mistaken for ransomware, their true purpose is destruction, not financial gain.""   Matt Suiche, the founder of Comae Technologies, explained in an online post that it was designed to ""destroy and damage.""   ""Different intent. Different motive. Different narrative,"" he wrote.     Related: There's no 'kill switch' for this new virus   Ground zero for the cyberattack appears to have been Ukraine, according to Kaspersky. It quickly spread around the world, infecting the computer networks of major corporations.   The virus hit big global brands like snack maker Mondelez (MDLZ), advertising giant WPP (WPPGF), pharmaceutical firm Merck (MRK) and a subsidiary of delivery firm FedEx (FDX).   The software infected computers and locked down their hard drives. It demanded a $300 ransom in the digital currency Bitcoin in return for unlocking the files.   But Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a senior researcher at Kaspersky, said the bug's code shows it would be impossible for the hackers to decrypt the documents.   ""It's not designed to work properly,"" he said.   If the primary objective was financial gain, the virus doesn't appear to have been very successful.   Kaspersky said that it had seen only 24 people hand over the ransom in an effort to rid their machines of the virus, with payments totaling $6,000.   The cybersecurity firm added that it does not have information on which ""threat actor"" is behind the attack.   Related: What is ransomware?   Another major cyberattack called WannaCry spread around the world in mid-May, infecting upwards of a million machines while demanding ransom money from victims.   Intelligence agencies and security researchers have linked the WannaCry attacks to a hacking group associated with North Korea. "

""It is a demonstration of how cybercrime evolves at scale.""   A kill switch is a feature that would automatically stop the spread of the ransomware.

Cybereason's Amit Serper said creating a file that tricks the malware into thinking it's already infected the computer would be a temporary solution. The company also updated its security technology to automatically detect and prevent the ransomware.   The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Group IB estimated that about 100 companies and organizations have been hit by the virus. The victims are spread around the globe and across different industries, including banking, transportation, energy and even candy.   They include big global brands like snack maker Mondelez (MDLZ), British advertising giant WPP (WPPGF) and the real estate division of French bank BNP Paribas. Ukrainian companies and government agencies seem to have been hit particularly hard by the virus.

French retailer Auchan Group and the real estate division of BNP Paribas were also affected.   Ukrainian organizations took a particularly heavy blow. Banks, government offices, the postal service and Kiev's metro system were experiencing problems, officials said.

Mondelez said its five manufacturing facilities in Australia and New Zealand had all been hit but some of them were still able to carry out limited production. And a Maersk facility for shipping containers in the Indian port city of Mumbai was shut down.   ""There obviously are companies that will have been affected by this in Asia,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of Hong Kong-based cybersecurity provider Network Box. ""But the success levels are lower, as they're attacking the same vulnerabilities as WannaCry.""      Regular consumers who have up-to-date Windows computers are safe from this attack, experts say. However, if there's one out-of-date machine on a company's network, it could infect other connected computers.   There is no kill switch, or a feature that would automatically stop the spread of the ransomware. During last month's WannaCry attack, a researcher accidentally created a kill switch by registering a domain contained in the malware. However, Amit Serper, a researcher for Cybereason, said a temporary solution for Petya exists. Businesses can manually add a folder to each computer to trick the ransomware into thinking it had already infected the machine.      Researchers are still figuring out exactly what happened. But Cisco Talos says one way the ransomware got into computer systems was through software in Ukraine, a country that was hit especially hard by the attacks.   A Ukrainian company called MeDoc sent out a compromised update to its tax software that contained the malware, infecting computers that were running it, said Williams, the security expert at Cisco Talos.

But according to security firm Kaspersky Lab, preliminary findings indicate the attacks are from a new ransomware that it's now calling ""ExPetr.""    Either way, researchers say Tuesday's attacks use a Windows flaw called EternalBlue to spread through corporate networks. WannaCry also leveraged the EternalBlue exploit, which was leaked as part of a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA. Microsoft (MSFT) issued a patches for the exploits in March.

The technique of using a computer virus to hold data hostage has been around for decades, gaining more notoriety in recent years. But the two massive attacks that spread around the world recently -- one last month and another on Tuesday -- have taken it to a whole new level.   ""It's only going to get worse and worse and worse,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box. ""And it's absurd because companies have had years to prepare for this.""   Here's the lowdown on this type of malicious software scam:   Related: Another big malware attack ripples across the world      At its heart, ransomware mimics the age old crime of kidnapping: someone takes something you value, and in order to try to get it back, you have to pay up.   For it to work, computers need to be infected with a virus, which is usually accomplished by tricking someone into clicking on a link.   Imagine, for example, you're sitting at your computer and you receive an email that pretends to be from a well-known organization, like Fedex. The email says Fedex just tried to deliver a package, the delivery guy is still in the area, and if you click on the link, he will attempt to deliver it again in the next couple hours.   ""It all looks so real,"" Gazeley said. ""They're creating a sense of urgency, click on the link to get my parcel right now.""  This is a modal window.     Ransomware can also be spread by clicking on an attachment.   In recent years, emails used to distribute ransomware typically contained documents like fake mail delivery notifications, energy bills or tax returns, according to a 2015 report from security company Symantec.   Once users click on the link or attachment, the ransomware encrypts the computer's hard drive, locking people out of computer files, including photos and music libraries.   A screen will appear threatening to destroy the files unless a ransom is paid.   Related: World's biggest cyberattack sends countries into 'disaster recovery mode'      The first known ransomware attack, dubbed AIDS Trojan, happened in 1989, according to Symantec. The payment demanded was $189.   It was ultimately unsuccessful because few people used personal computers at the time, and the internet was mostly used by science and technology experts. Also, international payments weren't as common back then.   Fast forward to today: a huge amount of data is regularly stored on computers, people are connected to the internet via an array of devices, and sending money internationally takes little more than a swipe and a tap.  This is a modal window.     That's what makes modern ransomware attacks so painful. Most people would panic if they got locked out of their computers. Extorted companies lose productivity, and in the case of hospitals locked out of patient files, lives are potentially on the line.   ""The way ransomware is spread now, it's so efficient, it's so effective, it's sort of -- to quote an ironic phrase -- going viral,"" said Gazeley.   Related: How to protect yourself from the massive ransomware attack      Hospitals in the U.K. falling victim to the WannaCry attack in May received a lot of attention. But experts say it was an equal opportunity attack, targeting everything from hotels to fashion companies.   Gazeley likened the attack to someone shooting indiscriminately into a crowd with a machine gun and striking a grandmother or a baby. ""You can't say you didn't mean to hit them, you shouldn't have been shooting into a crowd in the first place,"" he said.   But cybercriminals treat these attacks like a business, casting a wide net to get the most bang for their buck.   Related: 'Ransomware' crime wave growing   Some even have ransomware help desks, giving victims a few files back for free to reassure them they are not being completely conned.   But freeing the rest of your files and data will cost you. The average ransom amount is $300 per computer, and the favored payment is bitcoin, according to Symantec.   That may seem like a relatively small amount of money, but experts say asking for an affordable sum means hackers are more likely to get paid. "

By late Tuesday, roughly $8,500 had been deposited in Bitcoin accounts linked to the attack.   The amount of money such attacks generate keeps going up. According to recent research from Symantec, the average ransomware attack made $1,077 last year, a 266% increase from the year before.   And victims keep paying up -- despite warnings not to from law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, who say there's no guarantee people will get everything back.   Related: Another big malware attack ripples across the world   Security firm Kaspersky Lab said Tuesday's ransomware attack used exploits previously leaked in a batch of hacking tools believed to belong to the U.S. National Security Agency.   These tools take advantage security holes in some Windows operating systems. Microsoft (MSFT) released a patch for these flaws in March, but many companies are still at risk because they didn't patch their systems. The WannaCry attack in May also used one of the same exploits.   Companies don't patch for a variety of reasons: their machines don't support the patch, it's too expensive to do it, it might disrupt their services or they simply forget about an outdated computer on their network.  This is a modal window.     Large-scale ransomware attacks will continue to happen because businesses still have holes in their systems and because government-grade hacking tools are widely available, said Jon DiMaggio, a threat intelligence researcher at Symantec.   ""We now have these elite weapons that can be used by pretty much anyone,"" DiMaggio said.   Previously ransomware criminals would specifically target their victims. WannaCry was the first time researchers saw a large-scale ransomware that could worm its way through networks. Tuesday's attack spread in a similar way.   Related: Attack sparks debate on when spy agencies should disclose cyber holes   But such widespread attacks may not be the smartest way for hackers to make money.   About $130,000 in ransom payments from the WannaCry attack is still sitting in Bitcoin accounts being monitored by cybersecurity researchers. Experts say it will be difficult for the attackers to do anything with the money without it being traced by governments and cyber sleuths.   According to Michael Kaiser, executive director of National Cyber Security Alliance, there are ways to reduce the risk of ransomware attacks: Update software as soon as patches become available, use strong security like two-factor authentication for logging into accounts and regularly backup your system.

The former NBA star teamed up with online betting firm Paddy Power for a series of trips to the isolated nation in 2013. This time around, he's gone in with the backing of PotCoin, a digital currency for the cannabis industry.   ""Headed back to North Korea. Thank you PotCoin.com for sponsoring my mission,"" Rodman tweeted Tuesday before taking a flight from Beijing to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.   It's not clear exactly what Rodman is hoping to achieve with his latest visit to one of the world's most repressive regimes. For PotCoin, the goal appears to be publicity.  I'm back! Thanks to my sponsor https://t.co/zBtIFz1QBr. #NorthKorea #PeaceAndLove https://t.co/G7t6PX3WV9    It posted a statement on its website touting its association with the ""historic trip,"" saying Rodman is in ""the very rare position to be able to claim long-time friendships"" with both North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump. (Rodman was a contestant on ""Celebrity Apprentice."")   But PotCoin didn't say what the trip has to to do with a bitcoin-like digital currency aimed at transactions between legal marijuana users and merchants.   The company's statement quoted Rodman as saying that ""the folks at PotCoin ... realized the importance of this trip and made it all possible for me."" The flamboyant Hall of Famer wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the PotCoin logo during his flight to Pyongyang.   In a response to emailed questions, PotCoin spokesperson Shawn Perez said its primary reason for financing the trip is ""because we believe in Dennis Rodman's mission to bring peace to the world.""     The digital currency was launched in early 2014 in an effort to provide the legal cannabis industry, which was being shunned by banks, with a secure way to make and receive payments.   One of its founders told the HuffPost at the time that it aimed to gain acceptance ""from growers and dispensaries in Colorado or Vancouver, to cafes in Amsterdam.""   The Rodman link appears to have already sent PotCoin soaring: the currency's value has jumped more than 60% since Monday to around 17 U.S. cents, according to industry website CoinMarketCap.com.   Related: Dennis Rodman hopes to do 'something pretty positive' in North Korea   The controversy surrounding Rodman's past trips to North Korea eventually became too hot to handle for Paddy Power, his previous sponsor.   The Irish betting website ended its relationship with him in December 2013 as criticism mounted, saying it was responding to ""the worldwide scrutiny and condemnation of the North Korean regime in recent weeks."" That included the news that the regime, which has been widely criticized for its human rights abuses, had executed Kim's own uncle.   Related: U.S. lawmakers want to ban American tourists from North Korea   ""We reviewed the project and, with the benefit of hindsight, recognized that we got this one wrong,"" Paddy Power said at the time.

He checked into rehab soon after his return. "
355,355,Microsoft warns of 'elevated risk of cyber attacks' in releasing new updates,http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/technology/microsoft-cyber-attacks-windows-wannacry-updates/index.html,"Jun 13, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   ""In reviewing the updates for this month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyber attacks by government organizations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors or other copycat organizations,"" Adrienne Hall, General Manager of Microsoft's Cyber Defense Operations Center, said in a blog post.   The WannaCry ransomware attack targeted hundreds of thousands of machines around the world, locking computers unless victims paid a ransom in Bitcoin. The ransomware spread through a flaw in Windows that was leaked as part of a trove of hacking tools believed to belong to the NSA.   At the time, Microsoft released updates for software it no longer supports, which was an unexpected move.   On Tuesday, the company once again issued updates for old, outdated systems.   Related: Why WannaCry ransomware took down so many businesses   It's unclear whether Microsoft (MSFT) has been warned of another cyberattack using similar exploits that WannaCry leveraged. A Microsoft spokesperson told CNN Tech that security teams are actively monitoring cyberthreats, and the decision to release Tuesday's updates is ""an exception based on the current threat landscape and the potential impact to customers and their businesses.""   Security experts have said there are similarities between the code used in the WannaCry attack and a hacking group linked to North Korea.   Tuesday's security update includes patches to its Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Server 2003 products, which are unsupported but still widely-used. These patches must be installed manually. Updates will be automatically available for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 and Windows Server releases after 2008. Microsoft suggests customers enable Windows Update if they haven't already.   Microsoft distributed the updates in addition to this month's ""Patch Tuesday,"" the security updates Microsoft rolls out each month.   Part of the reason why WannaCry was so successful was because many of the facilities attacked -- like hospitals and businesses -- had not updated their software to patch the holes. "
356,356,Gold rush: The yellow metal is soaring again,http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/06/investing/gold-prices-geopolitical-concerns/index.html,"Jun 6, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Qatar. The latest terror attacks in London. The upcoming U.K. election. More drama in the Trump administration as former FBI director James Comey is set to testify in front of Congress Thursday.   Is that enough turmoil for you?   All of these geopolitical concerns are helping to lift gold prices. They rose an additional 1% on Tuesday.   Some think gold could climb even higher, especially if Qatar and other nations in the Middle East continue to feud. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others have cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar, which they have accused of sponsoring terrorism.   Ding Yao, an analyst with ThinkMarkets in London, said in a report that ""the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Qatar could change the shape of the Middle East"" and has the potential to push gold to $1,350 an ounce ""if the tensions continue to escalate.""   The spike in gold is happening as the U.S. dollar continues to weaken and long-term Treasury bond yields slip as well.   A decline in the value of the dollar tends to be a good sign for gold.   Fans of the yellow metal often point out that gold is not as subject to the whims of politicians and central bankers since it's not a paper currency. The supply of gold is determined by what's in the ground, not a government printing press.   What's more, the price of digital currency bitcoin is soaring too. It was only last week that bitcoin prices topped $2,000 for the first time. They are now approaching $3,000.   These are potential signs that investors are also starting to get nervous about the U.S. economy, especially after the government reported last Friday that fewer jobs were added in May than expected, and job gains for prior months were revised lower.   Related: Dollar slumps to lowest level of the Trump era   The U.S. stock market still remains near all-time highs despite these worries. But investors may be coming to the conclusion that having exposure to assets like gold that could do well if stocks go down isn't the worst idea in the world.   ""Investors are hedging their bets to some degree. There are some potential negative surprises lurking,"" said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve.   One big concern? Consumer debt levels are rising again -- and are even above 2008 levels.   This doesn't mean that another financial collapse like the one the global economy suffered nine years ago is nigh. But it does mean that the U.S. economy may not wind up roaring back to life anytime soon.   Analysts at research firm Incrementum wrote in a report last week that worries about a sluggish economy, coupled with the highly uncertain and volatile political landscape in Washington should push gold even higher.   ""The rally in the precious metals sector has probably only just begun,"" the Incrementum analysts wrote, adding that ""the election of probably the most unpredictable U.S. president of all time"" is another reason why this gold rush may not be over yet.

357,357,Identity thieves used stolen data 9 minutes after it was posted online,http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/26/technology/identity-thieves-stolen-data-ftc/index.html,"May 26, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Over the course of three weeks in April and May, the FTC analyzed what happens when hacked personal data is shared online.   Researchers created 100 fake consumers and gave them fictitious personal information like names, emails and passwords, and either a credit card, Bitcoin wallet, or online payment account. Then they posted the collection of data on a site popular with leaking stolen credentials, once on April 27 and a second time on May 4.   According to Dan Salsburg, acting chief at the FTC's Office of Technology Research and Investigation, the the FTC observed two types of identity thieves -- those who want to test credit cards' authenticity to resell them, and those who tried making big purchases on things like clothing or hotels.   ""There are people laying there in wait, ready to pounce on stolen credentials,"" Salsburg told CNNTech.   Related: Your data is not safe. Here's how to lock it down   Nine minutes after the publication on May 4, thieves began using the data -- a Twitter (TWTR) bot picked up the posting, which could have helped speed up hacking attempts. On April 27, it took one and a half hours before the fake credentials were used.   All told, there were over 1,200 attempts to access accounts belonging to the fake consumers. That includes a total of $12,825.53 attempted credit card purchases and 493 attempts to access emails.   There are ways you can prevent cybercriminals from using your data, even if it's published online. Salsburg said some of the test accounts were protected by two-factor authentication, a security feature that requires a second code in addition to your password (usually texted to your phone) to log in to your account.   It's not a perfect solution -- if your phone gets stolen, thieves could have access to your backup codes. But it is a simple and effective security tool.   Identity thieves did not access the fake accounts with two-factor authentication enabled. "
358,358,Trump thump is short-lived as stocks rebound,http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/23/investing/stock-market-trump/index.html,"May 23, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Stocks opened slightly higher Tuesday, setting the stage for a fourth straight rally day, despite the horror in Manchester. The Dow has now erased almost all of its nearly 373 point loss from May 17.   Of course, it's premature to say that the president is out of the woods following last week's reports that Trump wanted former FBI chief James Comey to halt an investigation into possible ties that his former NSA adviser Michael Flynn had with Russia.   Comey is expected to eventually appear before Congress to testify about the matter. And another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, has been appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to look into the Russia-Flynn-Trump allegations.   But for now, at least, investors have shifted their focus to what they still like about the Trump administration: his penchant for deals and plans to boost the economy with a budget that calls for big cuts in spending -- particularly on domestic programs.   Trump, currently on a trip to the Middle East, has reminded Wall Street that his top priority is job creation.   Related: Trump's first budget proposes trillions in cuts   The administration has touted several deals the Saudi government announced with US oil and defense companies during Trump's visit as ones that will put more Americans to work.   Whether that will actually be the case remains to be seen. But it's a big PR win for Trump if nothing else -- and a much needed distraction from the Comey narrative.   At the end of the day, investors are still hopeful that Trump will continue to make deals. Many seem willing to hold their nose and try to ignore the more chaotic aspects of this administration.   Federated Investors referred to last week's big market drop and subsequent rebound as ""a short-lived Trump thump"" in a report to clients Monday.   Linda Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated, added that during a recent trip she took to see clients in Western New York, one came up to her and said he still believed Trump would boost the economy even though ""it's too bad about his personality.""   Other market experts also think investors will continue to keep the faith in Trump -- warts and all.   ""Notwithstanding last week's turbulence, stocks have managed to tread water since early March while events in Washington have unfolded. That is certainly a positive,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist with Ameriprise, in a report.   Related: Defense stocks at record highs after Trump-Saudi deal   Fortunately, market stability has returned. Strong corporate earnings for the first quarter have clearly helped boost confidence.   Companies in the S&P 500 posted their best profit increases since late 2011 in the first quarter. And some big, blue chip companies posted solid results last week too, including Walmart (WMT), Gap (GPS) and Deere (DE).   ""Stocks are influenced more by earnings and economic data than politics and that proved to be the case again last week,"" said William Lynch, director of investments for Hinsdale Associates.   And even though the initial reading on economic growth for the first quarter was disappointing, many believe the economy will gain steam throughout the year as consumers and businesses continue to express confidence and show a willingness to spend.   Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said ""volatility is likely"" as investors keep an eye on Washington, but she doesn't think ""political events will change the U.S. economy's upward trajectory.""   There are still some signs of investor skittishness about the economy though. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is indicating that some investors remain on edge. The index briefly dipped into Fear mode last week but has rebounded to Neutral territory. But it was showing signs of Greed the day before the reports on Comey surfaced.   Treasury bond yields also remain low. Gold prices have been on the rise. The US dollar is weakening.   Related: Bitcoin prices are soaring under Trump   And one key component of the Fear & Greed Index, a measure of volatility known as the VIX, spiked nearly 50% on the day of the big market selloff. But the VIX (VIX) has steadily pulled back the past few days as the market has rebounded.   So for now, stock market investors are ignoring some of the warnings. But the bullish sentiment may not last.   The Federal Reserve is now in the process of raising interest rates and is unlikely to want to reverse course and cut them in order to once again save the economy. That means there needs to be stimulus from Trump and Congress.   ""If the Washington policy machine grinds to a halt, it is less clear that economic growth and expected earnings are likely to be strong enough to push stocks higher on their own,"" Ameriprise's Joy said.

359,359,Bitcoin prices are soaring under Trump,http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/22/investing/bitcoin-record-high-trump/index.html,"May 22, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Just in 2017, bitcoin prices have soared 125%.   And traders can probably thank President Trump for at least part of the big spike.   Last week, markets were rocked after reports about former FBI director James Comey's memo about being asked by Trump to stop an investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's ties to Russia.   Stocks plunged due to rising levels of uncertainty about Trump's ability to get anything meaningful accomplished as he deals with this crisis. And the US dollar weakened too. But bitcoin (XBT) is a beneficiary of this turmoil. So is gold.   One of the reasons digital currencies like bitcoin and lesser known ones such as Ethereum and Ripple have soared this year is because they, like gold, are not backed by governments. Bitcoins are tracked in a public online record known as the blockchain.   There are a finite number of bitcoins that can be ""mined"" -- that is, made available after a complex math problem is solved. And even though the record of transactions is public, there is a level of anonymity about who is making the transactions.   Bitcoin prices have tended to pop over the past few years at times of geopolitical uncertainty -- and especially when there were significant questions or concerns about the health of a major country's paper currency.   Trump has already talked about wanting the dollar to be weaker to help make the products of big US multinationals more competitive overseas. So that may be helping to lift the price of bitcoin.   The president also has some known bitcoin bulls in his administration as well.   His budget director, former US House member Mick Mulvaney, had been dubbed the ""Bitcoin Congressman"" by some of the currency's backers.   Related: Billionaire says he has 10% of his money in bitcoin and other digital currencies   And vice president Mike Pence's chief economist Mark Calabria has given speeches in support of bitcoin as well. Calabria was formerly the director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute before joining the administration.   Many experts also think President Trump's fiscal spending plans could be highly inflationary. That could further weaken the dollar and fuel the rise in bitcoin and gold prices.   But concerns about just what Trump will actually be able to accomplish in the wake of the Comey allegations are another big reason for the dollar's recent slide and accompanying rise in bitcoin.   There is even some speculation about whether or not Trump's presidency could end prematurely due to him resigning, being impeached, or removed via the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution.   Add it all up and it appears that bitcoin prices could continue to climb higher. But some are worried that the party could end soon.   I asked my followers on Twitter what they thought was next for bitcoin.   Several expressed concerns that prices will come tumbling down since bitcoin has been an extremely volatile investment over the past few years. When bitcoin topped the $1,000 level in January, it was the first time it had done so in three years.  @LaMonicaBuzz What's the acceptance among demographics? I'm apprehensive about it since I'm not certain about how it's regulated. @LaMonicaBuzz @AdamSinger Depends who you ask. Traders see a bubble. Technologists see limitless potential. Maybe this time is different? Pain likely on journey tho.  Those are great points. It is debatable whether bitcoin can ever become a mainstream form of payment. Just look at how little money the hackers behind the recent WannaCry ransomware made by demanding payment in bitcoin.   But Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki and a frequent guest on CNNI's business programs, noted that bitcoin may be the perfect currency for these crazy and tumultuous times.  #bitcoin has gone insane in the insane world it was made for. Global leadership chaos pushes price to $2183 and over $35 bil market cap. https://t.co/wvTW3j8cpu  In other words, bitcoin and its smaller digital currency siblings could continue to benefit from all the turmoil in Washington.

Stocks fell sharply Wednesday following reports of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey that says Trump asked him to stop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.   The Dow ended 373 points lower Wednesday -- about a 1.8% decline. It's the biggest drop since September.   A key measure of market volatility also spiked. The common ""I word"" in the market lexicon -- inflation -- is now being replaced by whispers of impeachment.   ""With a growing chorus of Democrats accusing Trump of obstructing justice and even calling for his impeachment, the Trump administration could come to an early season finale,"" wrote Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst with currency broker FXTM.   Gold prices have popped over the past week too. The yellow metal often does well when investors are nervous. It's a classic flight to safety bet. The US dollar has also sunk recently against the euro and other currencies. And virtual currency Bitcoin has soared.   Related: The super wealthy aren't selling stocks because of Trump   Investors had been betting that Trump would cut back on regulations against Wall Street firms put into place by President Obama. Those hopes may now be fading.   CNNMoney's Fear and Greed Index, which looks at seven gauges of market sentiment, slipped to Neutral mode Wednesday. It had been showing signs of Greed previously.   The VIX (VIX), a measure of market volatility that is one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, spiked nearly 40% Wednesday.   It's a fairly big selloff, but nowhere close to some of the bigger market drops that stocks experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.   It also comes just two days after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. Corporate earnings have been strong. Consumers remain confident as well.   The Dow is still up about 4% so far in 2017 while the S&P 500 is up 5%.   And the Nasdaq has soared 12% -- largely due to strong earnings from five tech giants in the index that just so happen to be the most valuable companies in America -- Apple (AAPL), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB).   Still, there are some indications of investor unease about the situation in Washington. Banks were among the biggest losers Wednesday.   Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) was down 5%. And Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) each nosedived close to 6%.   Related: Dollar slumps as Trump's latest crisis spooks investors   The market seems to be betting that, at a bare minimum, Trump's economic plans -- tax reform, undoing Obama-era regulations on banks and healthcare and stimulus though a big boost to infrastructure spending -- are dead in the water for some time.   ""Trump's agenda already had stalled; now there's the likelihood that issues like tax reform will get crowded out by this political crisis,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investments, in a report.   Valliere thinks that talk of impeachment is still premature, but that ""this a political earthquake, and the aftershocks will persist for the rest of Trump's presidency.""   Focus on that last part of the quote. ""The rest of Trump's presidency.""  This is a modal window.   One reason that the markets may not be in full blown panic mode about the latest crisis du jour in Washington is because they may be already anticipating the possibility that Trump will not serve a full term in the White House.   And even if Trump were to quit, be impeached or be removed from office via the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, Vice President Mike Pence might be able to have a better chance of getting some of Trump's proposals through Congress.   ""People are still looking ahead to the hopes of tax reform as opposed to whatever the new scandal of the moment on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is,"" said John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital Bank.   ""And even if there is impeachment, some would argue that you have a smoother political operator with Pence,"" Norris added.   Related: Wall Street Journal urges Trump to stop the 'pointless melodrama'   Investors just have to sit and wait to see how the Trump soap opera unfolds. For now, the market still doesn't see a need to freak out.   ""The question is whether these are US political rain showers like the ones drenching London's commuters, or real storms with lasting damage. Only time will tell,"" said Kit Juckes, global strategist at Societe Generale.   But if the chaos in Washington intensifies and puts the chances of any meaningful laws being passed that could help boost the economy in jeopardy -- even if Pence were to soon become the 46th president -- then Wall Street might finally begin to worry.

The WannaCry cyberattack that's making headlines this week has squeezed around $80,000 from its victims so far, barely enough to put down a deposit on an apartment in cheaper parts of London. But it's seized the attention of powerful governments around the globe.   What's more, the hackers' decision to use the digital currency bitcoin to collect the ransom money is likely to make it tough for them to withdraw their ill-gotten gains without being caught.   The malware instructed victims to pay $300 in bitcoin in order to regain control of the data it had seized, threatening to increase the sum demanded every three days.   Related: Researchers find possible North Korea link to massive cyberattack      At first glance, using bitcoin to gather the money could make sense: cybercriminals can set up accounts in the virtual currency anonymously. But anyone can see the accounts online and also view a record of transactions.   That makes spending the bitcoins or cashing out of them into another currency without getting caught a tricky task, especially when you've already attracted widespread global attention.   ""I have the feeling we will soon see ... how difficult it is to launder [bitcoin],"" Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos tweeted over the weekend, suggesting law enforcement and intelligence agencies could cooperate in tracking what happens to the money.   Related: Police warn: If you're hit by cyberattack, don't pay the ransom   They may have their work cut out: the global bitcoin market sees roughly 250,000 transactions a day. And criminals can use murky online markets to try to cover their tracks, said Leonhard Weese, who advises startups on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.   The WannaCry hackers are likely to have plenty of cyber sleuths on their trail, though. U.K. startup Elliptic has made a business out of helping law enforcement agencies trace shady money through the bitcoin realm to track down people or groups in the real world.   Elliptic is already monitoring the funds in the three bitcoin accounts linked to the WannaCry cyberattack.  This is a modal window.      Other decisions by the hackers also look puzzling, especially if their goal was to profit from the attack.   Asking computer owners who use outdated versions of Microsoft Windows to pay a ransom in an obscure digital currency is an optimistic request at best -- and it's one of the likely reasons why the amount paid is so low compared with the number of victims.   ""One or two people I know have joked to me that even if they did get hit, they wouldn't know how to get a bitcoin to pay them with,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of Hong Kong-based cybersecurity provider Network Box.  This is a modal window.     Police have told victims not to pay the WannaCry ransom, warning that handing over the money doesn't guarantee that they'll get everything back.   There have been more sophisticated and successful instances of cybertheft in the past. Cryptowall, a similar type of malware that spread through businesses around the world in 2015, is estimated to have made its creators $325 million.      All of this begs the question: Was WannaCry really about the money?   Patrick Coughlin, COO of cybersecurity firm TruSTAR, asked in a blog post Tuesday whether the hackers cared about financial returns at all or were motivated instead by a political agenda.   ""The answer is probably somewhere in the murky middle,"" he wrote.   ""No matter what you think about the motives behind this particular attack -- there will be more to come,"" Coughlin warned. ""And the next wave will learn from the impact we've seen (and not seen) here."" "

We're happy you're watching CNN 10 with our season continuing through June 2nd.  I'm Carl Azuz.   Getting started with the virus that's already affected more than 200,000 victims worldwide.  But it's not a biological outbreak that makes people sick, it's a cyber attack.  It started on Friday.   Its spread was temporarily slow down over the weekend by a cyber security researcher, but the criminals behind the attack found a way to get the virus spreading again.  And experts were concerned that Monday morning, when people got back to work, and started up their computers, the number of infected machines would jump.   The problem is caused by a type of malware, software that can damage computer systems.  What it's doing is locking up computers that used Microsoft Windows and holding them ransom.  If owners pay the ransom, between $300 and $600, they'll get access to their machines back.   The thing has spread far and wide.  It's been detected at least 150 countries.  International companies like FedEx and Nissan had been targeted.  Russia's Central Bank was reportedly attacked but wasn't hurt by the virus.  Other governments and businesses were taking steps to either contained or prevent the virus altogether.   And there is something people can do to protect themselves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Here's what you need to know about the ransomware that's been dubbed ""WannaCry"".   Security experts say this is one of the worst and most widespread pieces of malware they've ever seen, especially because it's even caused some hospitals in the U.K. to have to cancel outpatient appointments. So, what exactly happened to infected computers and how big is this? The ransomware actually locks up all the files in your computer and demands $300 in bitcoin in order to regain control.  People are seeing this message all around the world.  Researchers say this is spreading through a Windows' weakness known as eternal blue, which Microsoft released a patch for last month. This ransomware is actually just going through the Internet looking through vulnerable computers, according to cyber security firm Malware Bites.  That means you don't even have to click a phishing email to get infected.   How can you protect yourself?  Well, you know those seemingly annoying security updates from Microsoft Windows, if you've installed the latest one, you're safe.  If you haven't, do it right away.  For now, that's about it. Who's responsible?  Researchers aren't pointing their fingers yet, but the most amount of attacks so far have been in Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia, according to Avast.   (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ (voice-over):  Ten-second trivia: What happens when the moon passes between Earth and the sun and completely covers the sun? Total solar eclipse, annular solar eclipse, total lunar eclipse or penumbral lunar eclipse? Turn around, bright eyes.  When this happens, you're witnessing a total solar eclipse. (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  And one of those is likely to be one of the first stories we cover after our summer break.  Our new season begins on August 14th, and exactly a week after that, on August 21st, a total solar eclipse is expected to cross the continental U.S.  In fact, everyone in North America could notice when the sun is at least partially covered by the moon.  For those in the passing shadow, the landscape will appear darker, the temperature could drop.   What's being called the Great American Eclipse will last about an hour and a half from start to finish, and a couple of minutes when the sun is completely covered.   Total solar eclipses aren't that rare.  They occur about once every 18 months.  But the event this August is unique because it will be the first time in 99 years that a total solar eclipse cross over the U.S. from the Pacific to the Atlantic.  Sky watchers from Oregon, to Wyoming, to Missouri, to South Carolina will see it if the weather is good.  Some eclipse enthusiasts have had their hotels booked and their viewing parties planned for years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER (voice-over):  Long ago, ancient cultures around the globe looked to the skies in shock and bewilderment.  Many believed they were watching the sun being eaten by an animal, like a dog or a mythical dragon. Now we know there's a more scientific explanation for one of nature's most spectacular displays, the solar eclipse. (MUSIC) REPORTER:  Watching as the moon blocks out the light from the sun, it can be hard to imagine the amazing cosmic coincidence taking place.  The sun's diameter is some 400 times larger than the moon's, but it's just the right distance away to appear the same size. For a couple of minutes when the sun and moon are perfectly aligned, the moon completely covers the sun's disc.  The sun's atmosphere or corona can be seen in the dim light, along with stars and planets.  This glowing atmosphere is much hotter than the surface of the sun, but no one is exactly sure why.  It's a question puzzling astronomers. This so-called totality only exists in a narrow band, where the moon's shadow falls on the Earth.  Outside this zone, some observers can see a partial eclipse, where it looks like a chunk has been taken out of the sun. (END VIDEO TAPE) AZUZ:  Nomophobia is term we came across when preparing our next story.  It's a mash up no-mobile-phobia.  The fear of not having your smartphone or being connected with others through it.   Though the devices are a relatively recent invention, an increasing number of people seemed to have developed a psychological dependence on them and that's getting researchers' attention. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURIE SEGALL, CNNTECH SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's been 10 years since the iPhone debut and it's hard to imagine a world without the smartphone.   We use our smartphones to work, entertain, organize, do hundreds of daily tasks, even find love.  We might jokingly say I'm addicted to my smartphone.  But more and more, researchers are starting to agree.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So, think back to life without a smartphone. SEGALL (on camera):  Was there life without a smartphone? (voice-over):  There's no widely adopted diagnosis of smartphone addiction, but for doctors like Hilarie Cash, not having an official diagnosis don't mean it isn't real. DR. HILARIE CASH, FOUNDER, RESTART (via telephone):  I'm still amazed at how many people do dismiss it as a silly idea -- even plenty of people in my own field. SEGALL:  For those who specialized in technology addictions, what goes on inside your head looked similarly to what goes on inside your head when you're dealing with other addictions. CASH:  The regions of the brain that light up when engaged in to your smartphone, those are the same regions of the brain that are engaged when you're using those drugs and alcohol. SEGALL:  Dr. David Greenfield says it also affects your behavior. DR. DAVID GREENFIELD, FOUNDER, THE CENTER FOR INTERNET AND TECHNOLOGY ADDICTION:  In other words, you're using it like a drug -- when you're triggered by burden, you're using it as an avoidance of sleep.  You're using it to increase your mode when you're feeling a little down, or you're using it to avoid social situations when you walk into a party. SEGALL:  He warned it takes a trained professional to tell you if you're addicted to your phone.  Self-diagnosing won't work. That's because we're terrible at estimating how much time we actually spend online.  A 2015 study found that people use their phones twice as much as they think they do. (on camera):  You know, I actually think as human beings, we have less control than we think, right?  Because we're kind of -- we realize we're reaching to our phone all the time but we don't know why.  And I met a guy named Scott Dunlap.  And he was fascinating.  He spent much of her career building apps and using metrics to get us more addicted to our smartphone. SCOTT DUNLAP, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, BRILLIANT:  The notifications that you get, there's reason they come at a certain time that they do.  The words that are chosen in there -- every character of that has been AB tested for you and your personality type.  What we were in was the science of understanding what makes a product addictive. SEGALL (voice-over):  Over 77 percent of Americans now own a smartphone.  That's almost double since 2011.  What is clear is that our relationship with our phones is changing.  How we use phones in 2007 looks a lot different from life in 2017. GREENFIELD:  Normative use would be use that doesn't impact anything in your life.  In other words, you use it to make a phone call.  You use it for your GPS.  You don't have it on the table when you're eating your dinner.  You're using it but you're using it very moderately.  Now, there are less and less people that are doing that. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  Don't know if I could ever win an ice cream eating competition, but I sure like to try.

363,363,Global ransomware attack: 5 things to know,http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/13/world/ransomware-attack-things-to-know/index.html,"May 13, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)A massive global ransomware attack has struck hospitals, companies and government offices around the world, seizing control of affected computers until the victims pay a ransom. The majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. But the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and global firms such as FedEx also reported they had come under assault Friday. Experts suggested Saturday that the ransomware's progress had been halted, but new attacks could soon follow. Here are five things to know: It may not be over yet Cybersecurity experts have been working around the clock to try to halt the malware attack that is unprecedented in scale.  The ransomware's progress has been halted by the accidental discovery late Friday of a ""kill switch"" hidden within the code by a security researcher, said cybersecurity consultant David Kennedy, formerly of the US National Security Agency.  ""The software has actually stopped spreading across the world,"" he told CNN.  ""He actually probably saved lives by accident,"" Kennedy said, referring to the security researcher who discovered the kill switch.  The ransomware was designed to repeatedly contact an unregistered domain listed in its code. The security researcher -- who uses the Twitter handle @MalwareTechBlog -- registered that domain to collect the ransomware traffic for analysis and to track infections.  ""Later we found out that the domain was supposed to be unregistered and the malware was counting on this, thus by registering it we inadvertently stopped any subsequent infections,"" @MalwareTechBlog told CNNTech. The security researcher has posted an online account of finding the kill switch, which was also posted to the UK government's National Cyber Security Centre website. However, a hacker could change the code to remove the domain and try the ransomware attack again. Also, the kill switch won't help anyone whose computer was already infected. Individuals and companies still have to decide if they want to pay the ransom or part with their data. Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box, told CNN that the danger is far from over and that a company's security patch on Saturday might not still work by Monday. ""A lot of people are going to go to work on Monday and click on a link in their mail -- completely oblivious that all of this is going on or have heard about it and think that it's over -- and suddenly wipe out their whole company,"" Gazeley said from Hong Kong. ""IT managers need to be extremely aware that new variants of this ransomware attack are being launched almost hourly, so they can't just check that their computer systems are protected, then relax, assuming everything will stay that way,"" he said. Cybersecurity firm Avast said it tracked more than 75,000 ransomware attacks in 99 countries Friday.  European police agency Europol said it was working to support countries, saying the malware attack was at an ""unprecedented level and requires international investigation."" How it works The ransomware, called WannaCrypt or WannaCry, locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay to regain control of them. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of US National Security Agency spy tools. The malware is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that didn't update their systems remained at risk. Those affected see a message on their computer screens demanding payment in the digital currency bitcoin to restore access. The initial demand was for $300 in bitcoins, but it now has gone up to $600 worth of the currency, Gazeley said. Fortune reported Thursday that the price of bitcoin was at an all-time high. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at cybersecurity company F-Secure in Helsinki, Finland, called it ""the biggest ransomware outbreak in history,"" according to an online post. It's having a real-life impact The cyberattack affected 16 organizations that are part of the National Health Service on Friday, causing some surgical procedures to be canceled and ambulances diverted. But the NHS said Saturday it does not have any evidence that patient data was breached. A senior nurse with NHS Lanarkshire in Scotland posted a video on Twitter appealing to members of the public ""to stay away from acute hospitals unless it's an absolute emergency situation"" while its IT systems remain affected. Grant Gowers, 50, from Clacton-on-Sea in southern England, told CNN how the ransomware attack had directly affected him. Doctors told him two weeks ago they needed to schedule a prostate biopsy to determine if he has cancer.  But around 5 p.m. Friday he got a call to say his biopsy had been canceled as a result of the ransomware attack. ""I have built myself up for the last two weeks,"" he told CNN.  ""If I know I have cancer, I could deal with it."" His procedure is being rescheduled within the next two weeks. But that's not good enough for Gowers. ""I really want to grab the person who done this today and give him a picture of how this is affecting my life,"" he said. The UK government has called a meeting of its crisis response committee, known as Cobra, on Saturday to discuss the situation. Here's what you should do In the wake of the attack, Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. Users should download the patch before clicking on any link in email.  Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on. If your computer has been affected, there's no guarantee that paying the ransom will restore it, Gazeley said. In past ransomware attacks, some victims have paid, only to find the key they are given doesn't work, while others have found their files are corrupted and can't be properly restored, he said. Managers at many companies and other organizations have not taken steps to put proper cybersecurity systems in place despite talking about their importance, Gazeley said. ""Most organizations just keep their heads in the sand,"" he said.  Who's behind the cyberattack? No one has yet identified the culprit.  ""We see all the finger-pointing at the usual suspects, saying it's probably people in Russia or China, but, to quote Sherlock Holmes, it's not really a good idea to guess without the evidence,"" Gazeley said. Bitcoin is set up to be untraceable, so investigators will struggle to follow a money trail, he said.  Nonetheless, authorities around the world will be seeking to track down those responsible. ""I think these hackers have to recognize that these authorities will come after them with a vengeance,"" Gazeley said.  It also may never be known how much the hackers have netted from the ransomware attack. Many firms are unlikely to want to reveal they fell victim to it and whether they paid up. CNN's Paul Murphy, Samuel Burke, Selena Larson, Mariano Castillo and Jessica King contributed to this report."
364,364,Prosecutors: JCC bomb threat suspect tried to extort US state senator,http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/24/middleeast/israel-us-bomb-threat-suspect/index.html,"Apr 24, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Jerusalem (CNN)An 18-year old man accused of calling in hundreds of bomb threats to Jewish community centers in the United States also tried to extort a US state senator, according to the prosecutor's office in Israel. The man, a dual American-Israeli citizen from the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, demanded payment every 72 hours via Bitcoin from Ernesto Lopez, a Republican state senator from Delaware. The man threatened to order illicit drugs on the Internet and send them to Lopez's house if he did not pay, the statement said. The senator's district is in southern Delaware and it includes the cities of Rehoboth Beach and Lewes.  ""Over a year ago, I released a statement in support of Delaware children and teachers condemning repeated bomb threats being made to our local schools,"" Lopez said in a statement.  He was making reference to a spate of bomb threats in Delaware and along the East Coast last year. ""Today, I would like to thank all of the law enforcement agencies who participated in the investigation which has led to the successful apprehension of a prime suspect in Israel."" He said he would have no further comment because the case is ongoing and asked that questions be directed to the FBI in Baltimore.  The Israeli prosecutor's office issued a statement detailing the indictment sheet filed Monday morning in Tel Aviv's Magistrate's Court. The suspect is also accused of calling in a threat against the airplane of the NBA's Boston Celtics as it was headed to a game, the prosecutor's office said, causing a security sweep of the jet. 'Deteriorating health' Prosecutors say the man made more than 2,000 threatening calls over two years to airports, schools, Jewish institutions, police stations, and other places in multiple countries. He faces charges in Israel of extortion, money laundering, drug dealing, attacking a policeman, and more.  The indictment indicates a decision to try the suspect in Israel, making a US extradition request unlikely. His attorney, Shira Nir, said his detention has been extended until May 4 and his case has been moved to a juvenile court, since he was a minor at the time of the offenses.  Nir emphasized her client's ""deteriorating"" health and said she was seeking further psychiatric and neurological evaluations of her client to support her concerns. ""Leaks to the press from yesterday show once again the prosecution's strategy is to present my client as a villain, when in fact it is clear to see that he is a helpless young man on the autistic spectrum suffering from a brain tumor and with severe psychiatric disorders,"" Nir said. At the time of his arrest, his previous attorney, Galit Besh, said the suspect suffers from an inoperable brain tumor and that he has a history of behavioral issues. Under Israeli law, there is a statutory ban on revealing the identity of anyone accused of committing offenses as a minor. CNN's Joe Sterling and Andrew Carey contributed to this report."
365,365,Billionaire says he has 10% of his money in Bitcoin and Ether,http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/20/investing/mike-novogratz-bets-big-on-bitcoin-ether-blockchain/index.html,"Apr 20, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   ""Ten percent of my net worth is in this space,"" Novogratz said at a forum held at the Harvard Business School Club of New York Wednesday. He declined to say exactly how wealthy he is, but he's a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and a Goldman Sachs partner who made the Forbes billionaire list in 2008.   It's the ""best investment of my life,"" Novogratz said.   Bitcoin was worth under $500 a year ago. Today the digital currency trades at over $1,200. Back in 2013, Novogratz predicted Bitcoin's value would soar. He remembers people laughing at him at the time.   Since then, Bitcoin's price has been on a wild run. It surged to nearly $1,000 in late 2013 and then fell to under $250 in 2015. It started to fly again last year, around the time of the Brexit vote. It surpassed $1,000 in January of this year again and has kept climbing.   Now Novogratz is saying Bitcoin will go to $2,000.   But he also warned the Harvard Business School Club crowd that there will ""likely be a bubble"" in digital currencies. The best way to handle it, he argues, is the old Wall Street trick of diversification. Put a little money in a lot of different plays in digital currency.   Related: What is Bitcoin? Read CNN's explainer   For example, Novogratz was also an early investor in Ether. It's another digital currency that has quickly emerged as the No. 2 rival to Bitcoin. Novogratz says he bought Ether when it was trading for about $1. Today it's worth over $48.   Novogratz met Vitalik Buterin, the young Russian brainchild behind Ether at a dinner party at a prominent CEO's home. He recalls that Buterin, then 21, showed up late, which struck him as shocking -- and a bit ballsy. He figured it was worth paying attention to Buterin.   Ether is a currency with a ""smart contract"" function that gives users additional security and abilities to transfer information in addition to monetary value.   We're witnessing the ""3rd inning"" of this digital asset revolution, Novogratz predicts. He's not exactly sure how it will play out, but he plans to continue investing in digital currencies and Blockchain, the revolutionary technology behind the scenes that makes Bitcoin work.   Blockchain is literally a digital ledger to record and track transactions. What makes it so technologically advanced is that multiple companies or parties can access the Blockchain and see the history of what happened to an asset.   Related: Yext: The newest $1 billion tech company   Novogratz has emerged as one of the biggest Wall Street cheerleaders of Blockchain, but his bets haven't always gone so well. He exited Fortress in 2015 after the company shut down his Marco Fund for poor performance. It lost around 20% in its final year after his investments in emerging markets, especially Brazil, tanked.   ""We have had an extremely challenging two years, and I do not believe the current environment is conducive to achieving our best results,"" Novogratz said at the time. "

The solid report clears the way for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week at the end of its two-day meeting on March 15. The central bank has been waiting to make sure the economy is in a position of strength before hiking rates.   2. Trouble in Seoul: South Korea's Constitutional Court voted Friday to remove President Park Geun-hye from office over alleged corruption.   The removal of South Korea's first female president, which comes amid rising tension with North Korea, caps months of street protests over a corruption scandal that reached into the top echelons of business and politics.   Lee Jae-yong, the de facto chief of Samsung (SSNLF) and the country's most prominent business leader, has also been ensnared in the scandal. Preliminary hearings in his trial began Thursday. His legal team denied all the charges.   Stocks in the country had a muted reaction to Park's removal.   ""The installation of a new president should provide a boost to short term growth prospects,"" said Krystal Tan, an Asia analyst at Capital Economics. ""A return to normality should help prop up sentiment, which has been badly damaged by the recent political scandal.""   3. Crude stability: The price of crude oil rebounded 1.3% on Friday to trade near $49.90.   The move higher follows two very rough trading session for the commodity, which fell below $50 this week for the first time since December.   Investors are worried that an OPEC deal to cut production may not be enough to prevent oversupply in the market.   Data released this week showed that U.S. crude stockpiles are at record highs. American shale producers could deepen the oil glut as their output recovers.   4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were in positive territory.   European markets were also broadly higher. Asian markets ended mixed, with the Nikkei turning in a 1.5% gain.   The price of gold dipped below $1,200 on Friday.

367,367,"Security experts say 'Vault 7' leak describes common, public hacks",http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/09/technology/cia-smart-tv-wikileaks-public-hacks/index.html,"Mar 9, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The leaked documents that Wikileaks claims are from the CIA, dubbed ""Vault 7,"" contain notes about how the agency allegedly targeted individuals through malware and physical hacking on devices including phones, computers and TVs. Federal officials are investigating the leak.   The documents describe ""Weeping Angel."" That project, according to the documents' claims, centered on malware that could allow the CIA to listen to targets through Samsung smart TVs, even while the TV was in a ""fake off"" mode. Documents suggest the exploit required physical access to the TV to insert the malware.   Related: How worried should you be about hacking claims?   Samsung warned users about exactly this type of susceptibility in 2015. The company told CNNTech this week that it is ""urgently looking into the matter.""   But Smart TVs are notorious for potential security issues. In 2013, CNN reported a flaw in Samsung TVs could let a hacker remotely turn on the TV's camera without alerting the user.   Dan Tentler, founder and CEO of the Phobos Group security firm, recognized the tech described as ""Weeping Angel"" when he reviewed the Wikileaks documents. That appears to be the same exploit he witnessed in action onstage at a security conference in 2013, he said.   At the Breakpoint security conference that year, researcher SeungJin Lee hacked a smart TV, and demonstrated a ""fake off"" mode, like the one described in the CIA leaks: the TV appears to be turned off, but in fact the power is still running to allow surveillance tactics.   Lee tweeted about the hack referenced in the WikiLeaks documents: ""Nice, CIA. I hope you didn't send your TVs to A/S center during the Smart TV spying mode development. If you used my code, pay me Bitcoin!""   ""Weeping Angel"" may not have proven useful for gleaning that much information, said security expert Kelly Shortridge. The claims appear to say the agency doesn't yet have the ability to capture video, she said -- and if physical access is required, this type of surveillance can't be conducted on a large scale.   ""They mention concern over removal [of their access] when the [TV's software] is updated,"" Shortridge told CNNTech. ""Additionally, the [low] maximum storage size, combined with Wi-Fi not being available in the 'fake off' mode, likely makes constant collection prohibitive.""   Tentler, the Phobos Group founder, told CNNTech it's understandable the CIA's alleged exploits would be similar to what's been around for years: ""It makes sense to take what's public already, and build on top of that.""   Beyond TVs, the documents also claim the CIA studied and possibly used code from Hacking Team -- a prominent spyware firm -- on other devices as well. However, as the security publication Cyberscoop reports, much of that malware would be easily detected by antivirus software on your phone or computer.   The claims about ""Weeping Angel"" underscore the insecurity of the internet of things.   Companies continue to release gadgets, toys and appliances that connect to the internet with gaping security holes that allow attackers to control systems or collect personal data. Last year, researchers discovered a security vulnerability in ""smart"" toy teddy bears that could divulge information -- including names, birthdays, gender and voice recordings -- to the public.   After spending hours poring over the WikiLeaks documents, Tentler said if the claims are true, it's clear CIA hackers are just like any others -- they use tools already available.   ""The stuff in the CIA leak mostly comes from public research,"" Tentler said. ""These people go to conferences, they read papers, and they follow the work of the information security community."" "
368,368,Bitcoin price exceeds gold for first time ever,http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/03/investing/bitcoin-gold-price-value/index.html,"Mar 3, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The digital currency's meteoric rise in 2017 continued this week, with prices hitting above $1,290 per unit on Friday. An ounce of gold, meanwhile, could be had for $1,228.   A number of factors have been driving the convergence of the two commodities.   Gold prices were driven lower this week after William Dudley, the president of Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told CNNMoney that U.S. interest rates could be hiked in the ""near future.""   Low rates have helped gold because investors had little reason to own U.S. bonds that yield next to nothing. If the Fed boosts rates, bonds become more attractive.   Meanwhile, high demand for bitcoin has continued to drive prices higher.   Gold and bitcoin appeal to some investors as perceived ""safe havens"" that might provide security in times of turmoil. But they also have some major differences: The precious metal is a physical asset that has been sought after for hundreds of years. Bitcoin, meanwhile, appeared on the scene in 2009 and is entirely ephemeral.   Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare, said there's no direct correlation between their price.   ""The truth is that bitcoin is its own asset class in its own right and does fare well in times of uncertainty,"" he said.   Related: What is bitcoin?   Bitcoin can be extremely volatile: Its value fell more than 30% earlier this year after authorities in China -- where the bulk of trading takes place -- stepped up scrutiny of bitcoin exchanges.   Hayter said the controversy has since receded.   ""The issue where the [Chinese central bank] was reining in Chinese bitcoin exchanges has now been brushed under the carpet,"" Hayter said. ""Moves to regulate bitcoin more stringently will bring short term woes but will ultimately strengthen the ecosystem.""   Bitcoin is preferred by some people for its perceived anonymity, and it has also been used for illegal purchases of drugs and other products. "
369,369,Stuffed toys leak millions of voice recordings from kids and parents,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/27/technology/cloudpets-data-leak-voices-photos/index.html,"Feb 28, 2017","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," A security vulnerability allowed anyone to view personal information, photos and recordings of children's voices from CloudPets toys. And at one point, some people tried to hold all of that information for ransom.   According to a report compiled by security researcher Troy Hunt, over 820,000 user accounts were exposed. That includes 2.2 million voice recordings.   ""I suspect one of the things that will shock people is that they probably didn't think through the fact that when you connect the teddy bear, your kids voices are sitting on an Amazon server,"" Hunt said.   CloudPets toys connect to mobile apps and let parents and loved ones send messages to their children that are played through the stuffed animals. When you create an account with CloudPets, you give it your child's name, an email address and a photo.   Like other toys that connect to the internet, CloudPets stores all that data in the cloud, not on your smartphone itself. The toys launched in 2015, and include stuffed bears, dogs, cats and rabbits.   But as Hunt and other investigators found, kids' information was stored in an insecure database that didn't require authentication to access it. As Hunt explained to CNNTech, it takes one mistake to expose this data -- the error on the database was a bit like not having a pin on your smartphone.   This database was indexed by Shodan, which is a search engine for finding insecure devices connected to the internet. You can use it to see if popular devices (like toys) are leaking data -- you can also use it to take advantage of insecure systems.   Related: Your data is not safe. Here's how to lock it down   According to Hunt, that's what happened. Someone deleted the data, and posted a ransom note: CloudPets would have to give the bad actors Bitcoin in order to get its data back. Instead, CloudPets likely restored the data from a backup.   The data is no longer publicly accessible. But CloudPets has not informed users of the leak, and as far as researchers know, the passwords are still active. This could be a violation of the law. In California, the government requires companies to notify users if their information was exposed online. CloudPets, and its maker Spiral Toys, are based in California.   It's not the first security debacle for internet-connected toys. Hunt also discovered a flaw in VTech gadgets that leaked data on millions of parents and kids, and Germany recently told parents to trash Cayla dolls over hacking potential.   Concerned users tipped off Hunt to the CloudPets leak after their emails to the company went unreturned. Hunt worked with reporter Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai of the tech site Motherboard to try and contact CloudPets to report the issue, but was unsuccessful.   A CNNTech email to CloudPets was returned as undeliverable. Spiral Toys sent CNNTech a statement addressing a story about the leak reported by Franceschi-Bicchierai. The company said no messages or images were compromised.   Hunt said parents should change their passwords if they reuse the CloudPets password anywhere else. (However, you shouldn't reuse passwords -- here are some security tips to help keep you safe online.)   ""Normally I would say get in touch with the company involved, but CloudPets is non-responsive,"" Hunt said. ""I almost think the advice here is to get in touch with local regulators and make a complaint about this."" "

And with good reason.  Since the beginning of the winter tourism season, the 4-star Romantik Seehotel Jaegerwirt in Austria has been hit with a series of cyberattacks.  In one attack, the hackers held all system -- including the hotel's reservation and cash desk system --  hostage. The 180 guests (a full house) were locked out. The hotel said it had to pay 1,500 euros in bitcoin currency before the hackers would allow the guests back into their rooms. The hotel hopes that coming forward with the story will raise awareness of the possibility of cyber attacks.  ""Every euro paid to blackmailers hurts,"" managing director Christoph Brandstaetter said. ""We know that other colleagues have been attacked, who have done similarly."" For now, modernization plans for the hotel have been swapped for a make-under. To keep rooms open and guests moving, the hotel is moving from automatic to manual.  For the future? The hotel hopes to clamp down on cybercrime and safely move with the digital age once more.  CNN's Alla Eschenko contributed to this report."

The computer system was hit by ransomware, a particularly nasty type of computer virus that encrypts computer files.   This form of attack renders computers unusable -- unless victims are willing to pay an extortion fee and obtain a key to unlock the machines.   According to the library, hackers demanded $35,000 in the electronic currency Bitcoin -- but the library refuses to pay. Instead, it'll wipe the entire computer system and reset it, which could take days or weeks.   The cyberattack hit 700 computers at all of the city's 16 library branches, according to spokeswoman Jen Hatton.   The entire checkout system is on hold. No one can walk out with any of the library's 4 million books, magazines and videos. And all computers are frozen, she said.   The city's libraries are overwhelmingly used by school children and the city's poorer residents.   ""For many of our patrons, we're their only access to the internet,"" Hatton said. ""This is their only access to a computer. Some of them have a smartphone, but they don't have a data plan. They come in and use the WiFi.""   According to the library, the criminals managed to infect a centralized computer server, destroying the staff's email system as well.

The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department didn't immediately return CNNMoney's phone calls.   The FBI told CNNMoney it is ""providing assistance"" to the St. Louis library staff ""to determine the nature and scope of this incident.""   ""The compromise of public and private sector systems is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,"" said FBI spokeswoman Rebecca Wu.   Typically in these scenarios, local police and the FBI team up to investigate. Ransomware hackers are rarely identified -- and almost never caught.   Related: Cyber-extortion losses skyrocket, says FBI   The library's spokeswoman said the only bright side to this was that the library kept its large catalog of books and magazines on a separate computer system, so it was spared. And the hackers didn't manage to steal any information on the system's cardholders.   ""The good news is, St. Louis Public Library does not store patron or staff personal information -- or financial information on our server. No data from the public has been compromised in any way,"" Hatton said. "

The digital currency soared to its highest level in more than three years last week, topping $1,100 and nearing an all-time record. But since then, its price has plunged more than 30% to around $760 after Chinese authorities stepped up scrutiny of bitcoin exchanges in the country, where the vast majority of bitcoin trading takes place.   ""When China sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare. The latest drop was set off by news of spot checks from Chinese regulators on local bitcoin exchanges.   ""The market has gone from being led up by the Chinese to dragged down by panic,"" Hayter said.   Finance officials inspected exchanges in Shanghai and Beijing on Wednesday to check whether they were sticking to anti-money laundering rules and other regulations, according to statements from the Chinese central bank.   Related: Bitcoin tops $1,000 at start of 2017   ""The fear is that the [central bank] will impose strict or unreasonable regulatory demands on Chinese bitcoin exchanges,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.

""All operations at BTCC are normal and we continue to actively work with regulators to ensure that we remain compliant,"" it said, adding that it expects additional meetings with officials later this week.   The visits followed a public warning from the Chinese central bank last week urging people to ""invest rationally"" when it comes to the digital currency.   China appears to be putting the bitcoin exchanges on notice, analysts say.   It's ""clearly a segment of the market that regulators are getting increasingly concerned about and likely will regulate,"" said Zennon Kapron, the founder of financial market research firm Kapronasia in Shanghai.   Related: China is spending big to prop up its currency   For Chinese investors, bitcoin can be a way to bypass rules limiting how much foreign currency individuals can buy each year, as well as a hedge against the sinking yuan.   That's a worry for the Chinese government, which spent hundreds of billions of dollars last year trying to prop up its currency as huge sums of money poured out of the country.   Chinese regulators could clamp down on bitcoin by classifying it as a foreign currency, which would effectively limit individual bitcoin transactions to $50,000 per year, said Kapron, author of the book ""Chomping at the Bitcoin"".

""It was a perfect storm of events,"" said Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of digital currency comparison website CryptoCompare. ""Uncertainty is key.""   Hayter said the rise of populism globally means that ""walls are going up rather than coming down,"" and people are seeing higher risks of trade wars and other fallout from the ratcheting up of tensions.

374,374,Could a digital currency bring Africa closer to China?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/africa/bitcoin-startup-africa/index.html,"Dec 23, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)The digital currency Bitcoin has no ties to sovereign states and only exists as zeros and ones in cyberspace.  Now, a Kenyan start up is bringing Africa closer to its biggest investor, China, by letting companies on the continent send payments to the Asian nation which are traded in Bitcoin. Using BitPesa's website, users in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo can send money directly to bank accounts in China. It's fast and could cut conventional money transfer costs by up to 60%, according to the company. Until now African companies have had limited options for paying their Chinese suppliers in a swift and affordable way, says CEO Elizabeth Rossiello. More than 70% of transactions are made through independent money transfer operators -- who offer an often sluggish but cheaper service on average than post offices, banks or other conventional methods, according to a 2016 report. ""Some companies are even giving cash to a middleman who physically gets on a plane. There had to be a better solution.""  How it works Take a solar power start up importing their panels from China, for example. They can register via BitPesa's website and request to make a transfer. BitPesa then calculates the transaction fee, based on the amount and currencies involved.  The fee is agreed and the user pays with mobile money or by bank transfer. ""It arrives, depending on where you are, just a few minutes or hours later in the Chinese bank account,"" Rossiello says. ""We request your ID, your address, your date of birth (at registration). We check them against the same databases the banks use,"" she adds, highlighting the site's emphasis on security. BitPesa takes care of the Bitcoin trading at the back-end, and for the user the experience is much like sending money by any other independent money transfer service. Raised $4 million Established in Kenya in 2013, BitPesa -- which has raised $4 million in capital -- is not the only operator trading with Bitcoin in Africa, with others in this sector mostly based in South Africa.  But its China scheme, which launched this month and for the first time allows users to make online payments to clients in Asia, give the company a unique selling point.  With trade between China and Africa estimated to have hit $220 billion in 2016, as Chinese companies invest heavily in small businesses across the continent, it's a smart move.  Already, the company has seen interest from large multinationals. ""We are very excited by the initial uptake,"" says Rossiello, who pays her international staff in Bitcoin too.  International money transfers can be costly and often go via payment corridors that zigzag the globe before reaching their destination -- an inefficient and archaic method, says Rossiello. ""Why not have [money moving in] direct lines instead of spaghetti bowls?"" BitPesa hopes to keep expanding, proving that Bitcoin should not be feared but embraced as a tool which connects the continent. Not everyone is so easily persuaded, with some firms still wary of Bitcoin, Rossiello adds. ""You have to do it totally digitally. You can't walk into the bank. You can't pay in cash. It's a behavioral change."" The rise of 'digital cash' Created in 2009 by an unknown person with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has seen increased interest in recent years with some experts saying it could have a vast impact on the future of financial technology. There are different ways of trading the currency, and while some use it to shop online, others keep it in an online wallet in the hope of seeing the value increase.  One Bitcoin had an estimated value of $790 in mid December 2016, and around 180 million Bitcoins have been traded globally since the currency launched -- a number which has nearly doubled over the past year, according to industry platform Blockchain Info. ""There's been a strong increase in the number of transactions,"" says Eddy Travia, founder of the Bitcoin Institute and CEO of Coinsilium, who acts as an adviser to companies that use Bitcoin. ""It's really a form of digital cash."" The currency is anchored in a so-called blockchain -- a way of digitally tracking the transactions to avoid the money being used more than once. Payment companies that trade with Bitcoin tend to fall under the same regulations as conventional money transfer services, Travia explains.   "
375,375,Russian hackers consult for this cybersecurity startup,http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/12/technology/russian-hackers-cybersec.cnnw/index.html,"Dec 12, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Cybersec, set up in 2015, is a controversial business that uses the services of Russian and Russian-speaking hackers to provide cybersecurity services to companies. Bukh runs the startup from his Manhattan and Brooklyn law offices. He says he has ""at least half a dozen"" hackers who work for him, half in the U.S. and half in Russia or the former Soviet Union. They are paid on a per-project basis, usually via Bitcoin.   Bukh said news about the DNC hack was good for business.   Bukh, originally from Baku in the former Soviet Union, is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. He made his name defending many of the Russian hackers who have been charged and found guilty in the U.S.   He has an extensive network of current and former ""black hat"" hackers -- those who use their extensive computer skills to break into secure networks or websites, often with illegal intent. Launching Cybersec grew out of a desire, Bukh says, to put their formidable skills to use, and to help meet a growing demand among U.S. businesses to protect themselves from the threat of cyberattacks.   Related: Your data isn't safe. Here's how to lock it down   It's certainly an unusual business model. Some of the hackers he has brought on as consultants have already served time. Several are wanted by the U.S. government and staying away from countries with extradition treaties. One or two, Bukh says, are still engaged in nefarious hacking activities. A lot of the consulting is done remotely -- over the phone or online.   Why use Russian hackers?   The simple answer: They're highly skilled. It's partly the education, Bukh says, that sets Russian hackers and those from the former Soviet Union apart.   ""This is the culture of the country where math and computer science is a very important part of the college, of the school, and they do invest a lot of money into this effort.""   Money also plays a big role. It's not easy to make a good living as a computer analyst in Russia, and hacking -- particularly stealing credit cards numbers -- is lucrative. And Bukh notes, the Russian government rarely prosecutes hackers. In fact, there's a wide consensus among global cybersecurity professionals that the Russian government freely allows Russian criminal hackers to operate as long as they don't attack Russian business and government interests.   Related: Expedia IT guy made $300,000 by hacking own execs   One of the part-time consultants, Sergei Pavlovich, is a 33-year-old former credit card hacker. He turned up coatless to meet me in the Moscow snow, and said in return for his expertise, Arkady Bukh advises him on his own business ventures. He wrote a book about his hacking days called ""How I stole a million,"" and has launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise money to have it translated into English. He says he doesn't just advise on the technical methods of credit card hacking, but the social aspects of it too.   He described how the mother's maiden name was often the missing link to getting access to someone's bank account. On occasion, someone with good enough English would call the account holder to try to find it out. Pavlovich served 10 years in jail in his native Belarus and is still wanted by the U.S. government for his involvement in a credit card fraud ring back in 2008.   Another of Bukh's hackers, Vladislav Horohorin, first came into contact with Bukh when he hired him as his defense attorney. Horohorin helps out from his Massachusetts prison cell, where he's serving the last few months of a 3-and-a-half year sentence for stealing $9 million from an Atlanta-based credit card processor. ""We just think the way actual attackers might,"" he told me via email.   Related: Russia has banned LinkedIn   It's complicated   The fact that Cybersec shares a space with Arkady Bukh's law offices isn't just to save on overhead. The lawyers are on hand to help iron out any liability issues that come with using consultants who are wanted for crimes or have a criminal record. And Bukh says he is in constant contact with the FBI, who's aware he is working with some people on their wanted list. He would not say which hackers the FBI was pursuing, but said he cooperates if they try to negotiate a surrender with one of his associates.   Cybersec's clients have so far been small and medium-sized businesses, and some wealthy individuals. Large and publicly listed companies have shied away from the legal gray area, Bukh admits.   As for the consultants themselves, it's been easy convincing them to come aboard. It's just another way to make money, Bukh says. ""Hackers are usually businessmen."" "

In one corner, there's a tiny public company called MGT. Earlier this year, MGT (MGT), which has several online and mobile gaming units, announced that it was acquiring some of the assets of D-Vasive, a cybersecurity firm backed by John McAfee.   Yes, the same McAfee whose namesake antivrius firm was sold to Intel (INTC), then moved to Belize, and became embroiled in a bizarre murder mystery.   In 2012, McAfee's neighbor was found shot to death in the Central American country. McAfee was sought for questioning. He eventually went on the lam, was jailed in Guatemala and faked a heart attack there while in police custody.   Guatemala then deported him to the United States -- where he reinvented himself as a Libertarian presidential candidate. That didn't pan out. He lost the nomination to Gary Johnson.   Related: McAfee's new publicly traded security firm is soaring   But McAfee is now focusing on the business that made him famous in the first place.   MGT is in the process of changing its name to John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc. And shareholders who have been along for the ride have made out like bandits.   The stock is up a staggering 1,350% this year. MGT also is in the process of buying a company called Demonsaw, which makes an anonymous file sharing platform.   And MGT recently announced that it's getting into the business of Bitcoin mining as well.   Even though the value of the virtual currency has been notoriously volatile, Bitcoin mining could wind up being a lucrative side business for the firm. Bitcoin prices are up more than 40% this year and nearly 170% over the past 12 months.   But things could become even more tumultuous for MGT pretty quickly.   For one, MGT will face tough competition from McAfee's old firm, which Intel is now selling to private equity giant TPG.   Intel, which had rebranded McAfee as Intel Security, announced the deal last week. Intel will retain a minority stake. But TPG, perhaps recognizing that there's no such thing as bad publicity, will re-rename the unit as...McAfee.   MGT is now suing Intel as a result. It hopes that a court will find that MGT's plan to change its name to John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc. does not infringe upon any Intel trademarks that it acquired when it bought the original McAfee.   In other words, McAfee wants the right to his own name back -- and wants Intel and TPG to stop using it.   ""I find it unconscionable that after tarnishing my reputation with what I feel are inferior cybersecurity solutions to address today's threats, Intel is now trying to prevent me from earning a livelihood using my own name, and attempting to sell my name, something it doesn't own,"" McAfee said in a press release earlier this month.   MGT faces another potential headache as well. Showtime, the cable network owned by CBS (CBS), just released the trailer for a new documentary about McAfee called ""Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee"" that will air on September 24.   The fact that McAfee's controversial time in Belize is being brought back to the spotlight is not sitting well with MGT. Or its shareholders. The stock has fallen more than 16% in the past week.   MGT has slammed the film, saying in a press release that it's a ""purported documentary"" that is ""purposefully misleading to its audience.""   The company added that it is ""investigating potential willful damages inflicted upon MGT"" by the documentary's executive producer, Jeff Wise.   McAfee and other MGT executives will be hosting a conference call Thursday after the market closes. It will be interesting to see if he continues his attacks against Intel, Wise and other enemies -- real and imagined.   The stock could wind up spiking or tanking on Friday as a result.

They are planning to use the digital cash to settle financial trades using blockchain, avoiding clearing houses and settlement intermediaries.   The group is tapping into a technology that could save the industry a lot of money. Banks and other financial institutions fork out between $65 billion and $80 billion a year to clear and settle transactions.   It would also make the whole process faster, as financial transactions currently take days to settle through clearing houses.

The digital coin is representing real money in the transaction and spending it is equivalent to spending its real world cash equivalent.

Blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currencies, is based on a public record of transactions. Each transaction between two parties, or a ""block,"" is acknowledged and verified by the whole network of users and added to the chain.   The blockchain acts like a bank ledger and its transparency makes it very difficult to tamper with the data.

His international weapons operation offered anyone a virtual laundry list of weapons with brand names that have become disturbingly familiar: GlockBerettaUziHighpointWalther  To make these guns hard to trace, Gunrunner took off their serial numbers and shipped them to countries where buying these guns was difficult -- if not altogether banned by law.  And it was all happening under the noses of the residents of the sleepy little town of Manhattan, Kansas, population: about 56,000.  Gunrunner wasn't some dramatic villain like you might see in a Hollywood comic book thriller.  He was just a 35-year-old guy in America's Heartland, illegally exporting semi-automatic rifles, handguns and ammunition to Ireland, Scotland, Australia and England.  It just so happened that Ryan's online gun-selling operation got busted by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  ""The fact that international firearms trafficking has reached Kansas shows the power of the Internet,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Tom Beall in a statement.  As part of his June 6 plea agreement with prosecutors, Ryan admitted everything, according to court documents.

On the dark Web it's possible to buy or sell just about anything — including child porn or illegal drugs or stolen social security or credit card numbers, or even names on Ashley Madison accounts. If you want to explore the dark side — you're going to need ""special goggles"" — software that lets you see the hidden sites.  Tor is a part of the dark Web that hosts many of these hidden sites. It's an acronym for ""the onion router"" because the addresses for Tor websites end in .onion.  You can download Tor software for free and start browsing the dark Web anytime. But don't say we didn't warn you: You may find yourself venturing into the Internet's Wild West, where users often operate by a different set of rules.  Related story: Inside the deep Web The dark Web even uses a different set of currency: Bitcoin, an anonymous form of money that isn't tied to banks or credit cards or any nation.  Related story: What is Bitcoin? You may have first heard about the dark Web back in 2013 when the FBI shut down a popular marketplace site called Silk Road. It became an FBI target when nearly a million people were using it and sales rose to roughly $1.3 billion over about two years, the agency said.  'Like buying a bar of chocolate' In 2014, a teenager named Liam Lyburd bought a handgun and other weapons materials on a dark website called Evolution and had them delivered to his home in Newcastle, England.  Lyburd was plotting a massacre.  Online, Lyburd used names such as ""The Joker"" and ""I love my Anger."" He posted disturbing messages on Facebook hinting about his terrible plans. A Facebook friend tipped off police about his posts, and authorities then raided Lyburd's home.  What police found inside his bedroom was jaw-dropping: a ""kill bag"" containing a Glock handgun, hollow tipped bullets, pipe bombs, boots, overalls and a mask.  During his trial, Lyburd told the court that buying the Glock online was ""just like buying a bar of chocolate."" He was found guilty of plotting mass murder and sentenced to life in prison.  The Evolution site recently shut down, along with a few other dark Web gun marketplaces, including sites called Nucleus and Agora. How much gunrunning is going on? As you might expect, it's hard to know exactly how large and widespread the online illegal weapons trade is. According to a Carnegie Mellon University professor who researched the hidden Internet, it's comparatively small. Nicolas Christin told Fast Company that overall, illegal gun sales on the deep Web are tiny compared with other illegal Web trading — less than 3%.  By the way, it's entirely legal to buy guns online in the U.S. -- although the process is more complicated, depending on various factors. Nonetheless, the ATF said it's taking enforcement to a new level by creating an Internet Investigations Center aimed at combating illegal online gunrunners.  The center includes federal agents, legal counsel and investigators. Their job: track illegal online firearms trafficking and feed intelligence to agents in the field. It's a gigantic task, which aims to hit a constantly moving target.  Federal investigators pose as arms dealers on the dark Web to track down the deadly weapons killing U.S. forces and Iraqi civilians on the next episode of CNN's ""Declassified,"" Sunday, August 14, at 10 p.m. ET."

Bitfinex said it decided ""after much thought, analysis and consultations"" to generalize the losses across all users. That means even people who weren't affected by the hack will find that 36% of the value of their accounts will be replaced by a ""token"" labeled BFX.   The company said it will use those tokens to keep track of customers' losses and will work to compensate the accounts in the future. Bitfinex said those discussions are ""in early stages"" and ""will likely take time to play out.""

He's not ""their guy,"" many of his policies make CEOs cringe, and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein has even gone on record to say: Trump's ""finger on the button blows my mind.""   If Trump wins the White House, numerous business and economic leaders predict the stock market and economy will tank.   The usual Wall Street reaction to a shock like Trump is to sell, sell, sell. Investors hate uncertainty, and Trump is unpredictability on steroids.   Yet so far, Trump isn't scaring investors. U.S. stocks are at all-time highs. This week both the Dow (an index of 30 large American businesses) and the S&P 500 (an index of 500 top U.S. companies) hit record levels.   Why?   It's simple: Wall Street thinks it's highly unlikely that Trump will be the next president of the United States. Clinton has a solid lead in all major forecasts. In CNN's latest poll of polls, Clinton gets 45% of the vote versus Trump's 40%.   Even if Trump does win, Wall Street predicts he won't get much done.   Related: 71% of Americans believe economy is 'rigged'      Morgan Stanley (MS) has dubbed this the ""age of incrementalism"" in U.S. politics. Presidential candidates promise sweeping changes, but they rarely deliver because in the American political system the president can't do much without the support of Congress.   ""Attempts by Clinton or Trump to exercise transformative power domestically will be stunted,"" wrote Morgan Stanley in a 50-page special election report out this week. ""Current evidence suggests the U.S. elections in November won't yield outcomes that substantially change market fundamentals.""   Like many forecasters, Morgan Stanley predicts Hillary Clinton becomes president and the GOP keeps control of the House. It's more divided government, regardless of which party wins the Senate.   Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has made it pretty clear he's got his own ideas on taxes, trade and other matters that don't match up much with either Clinton's or Trump's.   Related: Hillary Clinton's 5 ideas to improve the economy      The base case scenario doesn't freak out Wall Street. But some wonder whether the U.S. election could turn out to be like the shocking Brexit vote. Will the polls get it wrong in the U.S. election too and leave investors scrambling for safety at the last minute?   ""This extraordinary political volatility hasn't sunk in yet on Wall Street,"" said Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments, back in April. That's even more the case now -- just over 115 days from the election. ""It's a toxic brew for the markets.""   Sure, a ""modest Clinton win"" is likely, Valliere says, but he sees the other two scenarios (a strong Clinton win with the Senate flipping Democratic or a Republican sweep with Trump in the White House and the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress) as very scary for the market.   Related: Stock market enthusiasm enters 'danger' zone   He predicts Clinton would be emboldened by a big win and likely use her presidential powers to heighten scrutiny of Wall Street and other businesses. In contrast, if Trump won, he would probably move quickly to get the U.S. out of NAFTA and potentially enact tariffs on key trading partners.   For now, it's all eyes on the polls from the ""rust belt"" states. If Trump starts pulling ahead in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania, Wall Street will likely start making moves to sell stocks and buy bonds, gold and Bitcoin. "

Plus investors are loading up on U.S. Treasuries, sending yields lower. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield recently hit a record low. That's another indication that investors can't get enough of safe havens. (Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.)   And take a look at the stocks leading the market.

385,385,Is ISIS going broke?,http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/middleeast/isis-finance-broke-lister/index.html,"Mar 4, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This story was originally published in March.  (CNN)Outside the deserted town of al Hawl in northern Syria, a network of pipes converges on a plant with three oil storage tanks. It's a small facility, but for more than a year it helped ISIS' war economy, dispensing crude to middlemen willing to risk being bombed to trade it.  ISIS fighters were forced to abandon al Hawl in November. They scrawled graffiti on the tanks and rigged booby-traps. They also left behind a bomb factory and a source of taxation: al Hawl had 3,000 inhabitants. READ: How one strip of land could turn Syria conflict Its retreat from al Hawl is one small example of a growing problem for the ""caliphate."" Its revenues are declining as its control over populations and resources shrink. In 2015, ISIS lost about 40% of the area it held in Iraq, as well as parts of northeastern Syria that have both good farmland and oil. Airstrikes on the oil infrastructure it controlled have further diminished the balance sheet. Some of its senior financial officials have been killed. Trading through Turkey has become much more difficult. Its cash depots have been bombed. ISIS isn't about to file for bankruptcy -- but its balance sheet is hurting. How come ISIS got so rich so quick? A terror group that claims to be a state, or a ""caliphate,"" needs a lot of money, especially when -- according to most estimates -- some 4 to 5 million people live under its control. ISIS did have a lot of money. Even before it went on its land-grab in 2014 it probably had assets worth $875 million,  according to a study by the Rand Corporation. Much of that came through extortion.  It also enjoyed windfall profits in the expansionary days of 2014. These included, according to U.S. estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion seized from Iraqi bank vaults. The branch of the Central Bank in Mosul alone was said to contain more than $400 million.  READ: Syria civil war: how we got here   It also grabbed thousands of tons of military equipment left behind by fleeing Iraqi security forces, and oil wells and refineries. The cash was rolling in. Speaking in October 2014, senior U.S. Treasury official David S. Cohen said ISIS ""has amassed wealth at an unprecedented pace."" Last year, the group captured valuable phosphate deposits near Palmyra in Syria, to add to those parts of Anbar province in Iraq which are rich in the material. Phosphates are an important ingredient in fertilizer. A conservative estimate would be that ISIS' cash pile and revenues amounted to at least $1.5 billion a year ago. But ISIS was also spending money -- fast.  Of course, ISIS doesn't publish accounts, so it's tough to estimate its spending. The Iraqi government budgeted $2 billion in 2014 for the provinces which ISIS then seized. The terror group is unlikely to be spending anything like that.    Even so, ISIS still has to provide basic social services, health care, water and electricity, and maintain roads and sewage systems. It has to pay wages, even more so when the Iraqi government decided last September not to continue paying civil servants in areas under ISIS control, a loss estimated at some $170 million a month to the local economy.     What about oil? In late 2014, ISIS-controlled oil refineries were producing about 50,000 barrels a day, worth an estimated $500 million annually. Rather than handle the sales itself, ISIS tapped into existing smuggling networks which sold some of that oil into Turkey. The margins were slim because there were many parties involved. Still, it was a lucrative trade.     But hasn't oil crashed?   Yes, it has, but that's not ISIS' biggest problem. Last autumn, the anti-ISIS coalition decided to go after the terror group's oil infrastructure with an operation called Tidal Wave II. It began targeting oil trucks, gas-oil separation plants and oil collection points.    On one day alone last November, according to a coalition estimate, 283 oil tankers were hit near Deir Ezzour in Syria, home to about two-thirds of ISIS' oil production. Mobile refineries have also been targeted, making it more expensive for ISIS to obtain refined products. The spare parts and expertise needed to repair infrastructure were hard to come by. READ: ISIS faces crude reality as oil output slumps It's difficult to estimate current production from ISIS-controlled fields. Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force in Baghdad, says it may have fallen to about 34,000 barrels a day. Another source tells CNN that at times it has fallen below 20,000 barrels per day -- a drop of 60%. Sources in northern Syria say the price per barrel in places like Hasakah -- outside ISIS control -- is about $20, while in ISIS-held territory it has stayed above $40. That price likely reflects shortages. There are many reports of fuel rationing, and opposition activists say the price of gas in Raqqa has risen 25%. The Financial Times reported in February that ISIS has cut its fleet of cars in Deir Ezzour from 60 to 10.  Who else is buying oil?   ISIS still has one major customer for the oil and gas it has appropriated: the Syrian regime. According to one analyst, the regime may be buying up to 20,000 barrels per day from ISIS. But isn't ISIS fighting against the Syrian regime? ""The two are trying to slaughter each other and they are still engaged in millions and millions of dollars of trade,"" says Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the U.S. Treasury.    ISIS' seizure of the Palmyra area in May last year included two gas fields and a pumping station known as T3. That pushed the Syrian regime into a bargain with ISIS: ""Continued flow of gas from eastern fields to regime power plants in return for payment or electricity supply,"" according to Yezid Sayigh, a senior research associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  And what about taxes?   As it rampaged through Iraq and much of northern Syria in 2014, ISIS seized huge amounts of personal property. In Mosul it simply appropriated and resold the homes of those who fled and seized their bank accounts. It may also have made $100 million from the sale of antiquities, according to Iraqi officials.    And it made obscene sums from ransom payments and the sale of slaves, especially young Yazidi women. In 2014, ISIS made about $20 million from ransom payments, the U.S. Treasury estimates. According to several studies, revenues from what is essentially looting and pillage probably made up 40% of the group's income. But you can only confiscate a property, rob a bank or sell a hostage once.  READ: Inside the $2billion ISIS war machine ISIS also levies heavy and various taxes on the populations under its control. Its zakat tax takes about 10% of people's income and it's been known to take about a tenth of the amount whenever someone withdraws cash from a bank account. There are fees for using water, electricity and cell phone services. Ludovico Carlino, a senior analyst at IHS/Janes, says: ""They charge a 20% tax on all services."" ISIS also makes money from Christians through an Islamic tax known as jizya. ""If they refuse this, they will have nothing but the sword,"" ISIS announced in 2014. '""Apostates"" have to pay a repentance fee of some $2,500, according to ISIS documents analyzed by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi at the Middle East Forum. Donations from the Gulf and elsewhere have helped, though not as much as with al Qaeda. International sanctions have hit donors and facilitators. ISIS has even tried -- with unknown results -- to exploit Bitcoin accounts to raise money overseas, even putting out an English-language guide.  So where is ISIS losing money? Perhaps ISIS' biggest problem now is a shrinking tax base as people have fled territory under its control, especially the professionals it needs such as doctors and engineers. ISIS documents have threatened medical professionals with having their property confiscated unless they return home.    READ: Will Saudi Arabia be sucked into Syria? The caliphate's economy is largely isolated from the outside world, making it more difficult to develop and sell the resources under its control -- from hydro-electric power to oil, cement and wheat. That's in part because of a major crackdown by Turkish authorities on widespread illicit trade from which ISIS benefited. ISIS also lost control of stretches of the Syria-Turkish border to Kurdish forces.    The anti-ISIS coalition has also made a priority of targeting the group's financial experts -- men like Abu Salah, described by Col. Warren as ""one of the most senior and experienced members of its financial network,"" who was killed last November.    That sort of expertise is not easily replicated. Other key officials have also been sanctioned, including those involved in oil. ISIS revenues are now some $80 million a month, with half coming from taxation and confiscation, according to a recent analysis by IHS/Janes. But that may not be enough.     What's ISIS doing about all this? Late last year, a document from Raqqa analyzed by Al-Tamimi revealed a 50% wage cut for fighters and civil servants ""on account of the exceptional circumstances the Islamic State is facing.""   Al-Tamimi told CNN the pay cut appears to have applied only to Raqqa. But he notes other austerity measures: ""Reductions in 'perks' for IS fighters and cracking down on 'waste expenditure' definitely exist,"" he explained, including restricting the use of vehicles when not needed for operations. READ:Twitter goes to war against ISIS   The squeeze may have been aggravated by a U.S. airstrike on January 11 against an ISIS depot in Mosul, which destroyed ""millions"" in bills, according to U.S. officials. That appears to have provoked ISIS into stepping up tax collection efforts. In Mosul and Fallujah, according to anecdotal evidence, it has also begun ""selling"" the right to leave to the few who can afford to do so. It costs $1,000 -- $2,000.   According to some Iraqi sources, ISIS also began dispersing its cash holdings. The coalition announced last weekend that an airstrike hit an ISIS financial distribution center near Qarraya, 45 miles south of Mosul. Where else does ISIS have problems?   As its supply lines are cut, in northern Iraq for example, ISIS has to spend more to transport fighters, weapons and supplies via more circuitous routes across the Jazeera desert.    Moving cash to buy supplies is also becoming more difficult. The U.S. Treasury Department, working with some 30 other countries and organizations, is trying to cut bank branches in ISIS-held territory in Iraq out of the international system.   But for now, ISIS is still able to access money-changers in Iraq, Turkey and Lebanon who operate outside the formal financial system.  ""Don't underestimate continued cash flow with the outside world,"" Al-Tamimi told CNN. ""So long as that continues, I don't see a fatal economic collapse from within -- just the standard of living getting worse and worse."" So what's going to happen?   ISIS is adaptive and resilient. It continues to function, with a sophisticated bureaucracy driving tax collection. Were it a typical terrorist group not focused on governing an area larger than Belgium, money might not be such a concern.  But its credo is about maintaining and expanding a state.

Richard Huckle, 30, was arrested at Gatwick Airport near London in 2014 as he returned home from Malaysia, where he committed most of his crimes, Britain's National Crime Agency said. He confessed to abusing almost 200 children on a blog he published on the dark web, an area of the Internet not easily accessible to the general user.  Chemical castration for child sex abusers in Indonesia  According to Court News UK, Huckle posed as a Christian English teacher to groom and abuse children, including one as young a 6 months, in a poor Malaysian community over nine years. He also committed child abuse in Cambodia, the National Crime Agency said. British law allows nationals to be prosecuted in their home country for offenses committed abroad. The court heard the amateur photographer took pictures and videos of himself raping children that he groomed from schools and orphanages, and shared the images with other pedophiles on the dark web, according to Court News UK. In his  blog, Huckle awarded himself ""Pedopoints"" on a type of scorecard, claiming to have abused 191 children, according to Court News. Huckle then tried to monetize his behavior, accepting bitcoin, the online currency, to continue the abuse and publish it online, Court News said. He forced victims to pose with signs to advertise his business and wrote a 60-page guide entitled ""Pedophiles & Poverty: Child Lover Guide"" that the judge called a ""truly evil document,"" Court News said. Huckle was caught when Australian police tipped off authorities in an investigation into a pedophile website that officials said had 9,000 members before it was shut down. The NCA said officials had recovered more than 20,000 indecent images of children from Huckle's computers and cameras, including more than 1,000 of which showed him raping and abusing children in his care. ""Richard Huckle spent several years integrating himself into the community in which he lived, making himself a trusted figure. But he abused that trust in the worst possible way,"" said James Traynor from the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Center.  ""He deliberately traveled to a part of the world where he thought he could abuse vulnerable children without being caught,"" he said. ""Borders are no barrier -- we are determined that those who go abroad to abuse children will be held to account.""   Huckle, who is from Ashford, Kent, has been ordered to serve at least 25 years of his sentence.  The court heard about several horrific cases of Huckle's abuse, including that of a 5-year-old girl on her birthday at his home, the NCA said, adding that Huckle offered private English language tuition to earn the trust of children and their families. Huckle traveled in and out of Asia over many years, in 2006 spending two weeks in Cambodia, staying with a local family, whose 3-year-old child was one of his victims, the NCA said. In 2007, he returned to Malaysia and stayed with the family of two young girls, taking up a voluntary teaching post at a small tuition center in the village, the NCA said. It said he abused the girls over eight years. CNN's Milena Veselinovic reported from London. "
388,388,Exclusive: ISIS makes up for lost oil cash with rising taxes and fees,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/31/news/isis-oil-taxes/index.html,"Jun 1, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   That's according to new research from the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, which will release on Wednesday a new report on the finances of the Islamic State.   The authors of the report, terrorism experts Jean-Charles Brisard and Damien Martinez, conclude that ""ISIS's military defeat is not imminent... as things stand, ISIS economic collapse remains some way off in the mid-term.""   It says ISIS made $2.4 billion in 2015. That's a $500 million drop from the center's revenue estimate the previous year, but ISIS remains the richest terrorist organization on the planet.   The main reason ISIS is still making billions is taxes. The Islamic State's extortion of the people living inside its territory in Iraq and Syria has skyrocketed from $360 million in 2014 to $800 million in 2015, according to researchers.   The report is a sobering take on what has been an image of ISIS as a terrorist organization in disarray. In recent months, ISIS has cut fighter salaries in half and a nonstop bombing campaign has cut its oil production.   It has also lost 40% of its territory, according to the U.S. military, but ISIS still has about 8 million people under its control.   Brisard and Martinez say that ISIS has simply adjusted its business from oil to taxes. As oil fell from 38% to 25% of its revenue stream last year, ISIS cranked up its extortion racket. In 2015, taxes went from supplying 12% of yearly ISIS revenue to 33%.   Those taxes include a 10% income tax, up to 15% business tax, road tolls, 5% fees for bank cash withdrawals, and up to 35% taxes on pharmaceutical drugs. There are also fees for leaving the territory, even temporarily. And there's a special tax on Christians, mafia-like ""protection insurance"" called jizyah. The Islamic State's official magazine proudly speaks of ""imposing jizyah.""   ISIS says all taxes are zakat, Islamic religious alms similar to tithing.   ""It's really an adaptive organization,"" Brisard told CNNMoney. ""What strikes me is the fact that they're clearly behaving as managers, not simple looters. They really have budget requirements, and they're compensating.""     But the U.S. Treasury Department said the coalition's effort to disrupt the Islamic State's economy is working. The group is also known as ISIS and ISIL.   ""We are seeing progress... since late-2015, ISIL's production of oil has declined by about 30%. Their ability to generate revenue has been reduced by at least that much,"" Treasury said.   This particular research tends to give higher revenue estimates than those provided by other experts. For example, it says ISIS made $600 million from oil last year while the U.S. Treasury has previously estimated that it's closer to $500 million.   But several other terrorism experts say the main conclusions are still accurate: ISIS has flipped its budget.   The Geneva Centre for Security Policy will publish a report next week that details how ISIS has come to rely on taxes to fund its terror. Christina Schori Liang, a terrorism analyst there, said that ISIS is eying illicit profits from cybercrime as the next frontier. It's harder to track, allows for the use of digital currencies like Bitcoin, and doesn't abide by international banking regulations.        The report by the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism claims that ISIS still has an immense trade with the outside world, because the United Nations has failed to close off its territory with a formal embargo, and American coalition airstrikes have limited impact on the economy.   Brisard acknowledged that airstrikes have destroyed much of the Islamic State's oil-producing infrastructure. But he said the only way to truly cut ISIS funding is to recapture the territory it controls.   ISIS is besieged on several sides by troops from the Russian-backed Syrian government, U.S.-backed Kurds and other rebel factions, but the United States and Russia have shown no indication they are willing to commit their own military forces.   What surprises Brisard the most, however, is that the countries sitting on the UN Security Council can't agree to an embargo that punishes countries that continue buying cement, wheat, oil, phosphate and other products from ISIS territory.   For example, research estimates that ISIS sold 12,000 tons of cotton last year -- mostly to buyers in Turkey.   ""The current situation is absurd,"" Brisard said. "
389,389,Creator of online money Liberty Reserve gets 20 years in prison,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/06/technology/liberty-reserve-prison/index.html,"May 7, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Arthur Budovsky, 42, ran an online digital money business out of Costa Rica called Liberty Reserve. The U.S. government contended that the whole thing was just a massive, $6 billion money laundering operation.   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote sentenced him to two decades in federal prison. She said Budovsky did not show ""genuine remorse,"" according to the Department of Justice.   For seven years starting in 2006, anyone could use Liberty Reserve's website to transfer money with little oversight. All the site required was someone's name, e-mail address, and birthday. Normally, banks have stricter standards to avoid funneling criminal funds.   But that's exactly what Liberty Reserve turned into, according to federal agents. It became a favorite for stashing cash by credit card traffickers and identity thieves.   At its height, according to a federal indictment, Liberty Reserve had more than 1 million customers worldwide, including 200,000 in the United States. It handled 12 million financial transactions a year.   Liberty Reserve fell into the U.S. government's sights, because it ran such a huge operation without oversight. In the post-9/11 world, law enforcement was keen to keep track of every dollar to avoid it ending up funding terrorists.   That's why the U.S. government used the Patriot Act to go after this payment processor. The U.S. Treasury Department labeled it a money laundering organization, and cut it off from the American financial system.   In 2013, American investigators took over the website and shut it down. In 2014, Budovsky and several coworkers were arrested in Spain. Then Budovsky was extradited to the United States to face trial for money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.   In January, Budovsky pleaded guilty to money laundering and admitted to secretly moving at least $122 million.   In a prepared statement, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell said: ""The significant sentence handed down today shows that money laundering through the use of virtual currencies is still money laundering, and that online crime is still crime.""   Budovsky's attorney did not immediately respond to CNNMoney's request for comment.   Budovsky and an associate, Vladimir Kats of Brooklyn, had previously been arrested for a similar digital currency exchange called GoldAge. After their arrests, they both moved to Costa Rica to avoid American law enforcement, according to the U.S. government. Budovsky even renounced his citizenship.   ""Despite all his efforts to evade prosecution, including taking his operations offshore and renouncing his citizenship, Budovsky has now been held to account for his brazen violations of U.S. criminal laws,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.

390,390,Australian computer scientist claims he created Bitcoin,http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/02/technology/bitcoin-creator-craig-steven-wright/index.html,"May 2, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Australian computer scientist Craig Steven Wright has publicly identified himself as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" founder of the widely-used cryptocurrency Bitcoin.   Wright has told three media organizations -- the BBC, the Economist and GQ -- that he is the father of Bitcoin. The computer scientist has also published a blog post that he says includes cryptographic proof for the claim.   Bitcoin was created in 2009, but the identity of its founder has remained shrouded in secrecy. The creator used the name ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" but many experts have assumed the moniker was a pseudonym.     Speculation over the mystery flourished in recent years, and multiple media outlets carried out investigations that sought to unmask the founder. At least a dozen of people have in the past been named as Bitcoin creators.   Newsweek, for example, reported in 2014 that a retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto was the one. But Nakamoto forcefully denied the report, saying he had never even heard of the currency.   The New Yorker ran an article in 2011 that suggested a graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College could be the founder. The student denied the claim.   Related: Alleged Bitcoin creator denies he's the one   In 2015, tech publications Wired and Gizmodo put forward Wright's name. ""Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did,"" Wired wrote at the time. Australian media reported at that time that a house believed to be owned by Wright has been searched by the Australian Federal Police in connection to a tax issue.   But many questions remained unanswered.   The blog published by Wright on Monday seeks to remove all doubts. In it, the computer scientist claims to verify the cryptographic keys to a key Bitcoin ""block,"" or group of transactions, that dates to the early days of the currency.   Two leading Bitcoin developers, Jon Matonis and Gavin Andersen, came forward on Monday, backing Wright's claims.   Andersen, who is the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, said Wright demonstrated the supposed verifications keys to him at a meeting in London a couple of weeks ago. ""After spending time with him I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi,"" he said in a blog post.   Matonis, who is the founding director at Bitcoin Foundation, said he was also convinced Wright was the founder of Bitcoin, after attending a private proof session with him.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   But many other Bitcoin developers remain skeptical. They say the blog itself proves nothing, publishing something that has been ""out there"" for a while. They also claim cryptographic keys found on Wright's blog posts have been backdated.   ""The page copies a signature out of the Bitcoin Blockchain from 2009,"" said Greg Maxwell, the chief technology office at Blockstream, a Bitcoin startup.   Wright reportedly demonstrated the procedure for the Economist, which reported that, ""as far as we can tell he indeed seems to be in possession of the keys.""   But even the Economist, which agreed not to write about the computer scientist until the blog post was published, has doubts.   ""Our conclusion is that Mr. Wright could well be Mr Nakamoto, but that important questions remain,"" the magazine said in its report.   Wright did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. ""Some people will believe, some people won't,"" he told the BBC. ""And to tell you the truth, I don't really care.""   He told the Economist and the BBC he was not seeking publicity. ""I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration. I just want to be left alone,"" he said in a video posted by the BBC.   On his blog, Wright said he came out as the founder of Bitcoin to ""set the record straight"" and ""dispel the myths out there and unleash its potential to change the world for the better."" "

He says he finished treatment and thinks he can beat the disease, ""but only time will tell.""   Hepatitis C can lead to long-term health problems, including liver cancer.   In his statement about his leave of absence, Byrne quoted the character Chief Dan George in the Clint Eastwood movie ""Outlaw Josey Wales"": ""I myself never surrendered. But they got my horse, and it surrendered.""   Byrne is no stranger to health problems. When he was 22, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that had metastasized throughout his body. He has had multiple recurrences and complications.   Despite those challenges, Byrne built Overstock.com (OSTK) into a sizable e-commerce power player. Overstock is perpetually profitable, bringing in $1.7 billion in sales in 2015. This year, the company anticipates $40 million in profit, before taxes.   Byrne has made news less for his acumen as a business leader and more for his quirky interests and passions.   In 2013, Overstock became the first major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency Bitcoin. Byrne said that he was concerned about the possibility of ""bad currency wars"" in the future. He said the U.S. dollar is being undermined by the Federal Reserve's money policies and by overspending by politicians in Washington. He said he prefers gold to dollars.   Byrne also has gone on a decades-long rampage against naked short-selling, a controversial tactic used by Wall Street investors to place bets against a company's stock. Naked short selling takes place when a trader never actually borrows the stock he or she is shorting.   On its website, Overstock describes Byrne as ""a leading voice in a growing movement convinced that powerful interests on Wall Street are destroying American companies for profit -- robbing investors and destabilizing our financial system in the process.   Byrne helped Overstock shareholders file two lawsuits in 2006 and 2007 against naked short-sellers.   Taking over for Byrne as acting CEO will be Mitch Edwards, former CEO of BitTorrent and Skullcandy. Edwards has served as general counsel of Overstock.com for the past six months.   ""Mitch is an outstanding full-spectrum entrepreneur who has serving as our general counsel for six months and has learned our business, and understands our efforts to revolutionize the capital markets,"" Byrne said.

392,392,'Ransomware' crime wave growing,http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/04/technology/ransomware-cybercrime/index.html,"Apr 4, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Computer servers were acting unusual, and Charles Hucks listened as his administrators described frozen computers and a cryptic message spreading across computer screens.   Hucks raced to shut down the system before the unidentified virus could spread, but in minutes, up to 60% of the school district's computers were frozen. Hackers had encrypted the school's data, and that cryptic message was a ransom note.   ""They said, 'Hey you want to free your data? Pay us,'"" Hucks told CNN.   The school district nestled in the far northeast corner of South Carolina's coast became the latest victim in a crime wave racing across the globe.   Experts call the crime ""ransomware,"" where criminals lock digital files, like text documents and pictures, and demand a ransom before the system is unlocked.   The FBI says it received 2,453 complaints about ransomware hold-ups last year, costing the victims more than $24 million dollars.   Victims often pay because, so far, authorities like the FBI have been unable to stop it. That was the conclusion made by the Horry County School District.   ""You get to the point of making the business decision: Do I make my end-users — in our case teachers and students — wait for weeks and weeks and weeks while we restore servers from backup? Or do we pay the ransom and get the data back online more quickly?""   The hackers demanded to be paid in Bitcoin (XBT), a digital currency that's difficult to trace back to actual people.   Hucks says the district followed the kidnappers directions, bought several bitcoins online, then carefully negotiated a ""proof of life"" type transaction to make sure the cyberkidnappers would deliver what they promised.   ""We chose to send the payment for one machine, first, so that we could ensure that it would work."" Hucks says the criminals sent a code for one computer. He entered the code, and the computer returned to operation.   Horry County then deposited the equivalent of $10,000 into the hackers' Bitcoin account and the school computer system was back up and running.   Cybercriminals, many originating in Eastern Europe or the Russian Federation, according to experts, target small- and middle-sized institutions.   Earlier this year, officials at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles said they paid the Bitcoin equivalent of $17,000 to cybercriminals after patient and doctor records were locked for almost two weeks. The hospital says it had to resort to handwriting to cope with the computer lockdown.   ""It's a very bad trend that has been rising in the past few years,"" says Adam Kujowa, an expert for the software company Malwarebytes. ""It's the one we see people asking for help about the most,"" he says. ""And unfortunately, this isn't the kind of attack that you can get infected and you're done. There's no quick fix.""   At a recent cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, dozens of software companies advertised solutions for ransomware but only a few acknowledged success.   That has left many small- to medium-sized companies unable to defend themselves against the attacks, which often enter into computer systems by unwitting employees, according to Paul Roberts, founder of the Internet newsletter Security Ledger.   The ransomware pops up in emails, photos, Internet links and ""dozens"" of other ways, Roberts says.   ""Until we have a kind of global infrastructure to go after these groups making the attacks,"" he says, ""it's going to be very difficult to make these problems go away.""   Roberts says he believes the crime is actually much bigger than what the FBI is reporting. That's because companies often pay the ransom and free their data without reporting it.   ""Most people aren't talking. Companies don't want their customers, or governments don't want their citizens, to think, they're not protecting their computer systems,"" Roberts told CNN. ""And my guess is this is a much bigger problem than we know about and many of these instances go unreported.""   Related: U.S. hospitals are getting hit by hackers   Hucks says the Horry County School District has made a deliberate decision not to hide anything.   ""We know of several other districts, some other school districts, where this has happened, and they'd been able to keep it out of the news, which is great for them."" But Hucks says it's time to start talking openly about ransomware to warn others and bring attention to a silent crime wave.   ""We got hit, the hospital in California got hit. Virtually every day you hear of a virus such as this."" "
393,393,30% of bank jobs are under threat,http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/04/investing/bank-jobs-dying-automation-citigroup/index.html,"Apr 4, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   A wave of innovation has made it possible for people to get their banking done without walking into a branch if they don't want to. People can now deposit checks using a smartphone or digitally fire off cash to friends using Venmo.   The end result is a pretty sweet experience for consumers...but an imminent threat to people who work at bank branches.   The downsizing of the bank workforce is about to accelerate as more technology takes over jobs humans used to do, according to a new Citigroup report. Another 30% of bank jobs could be lost between 2015 and 2025, mainly due to retail banking automation, Citi warned.   ""Fintech is forcing banking to a tipping point,"" Citi said.   Former Barclays (BCS) CEO Antony Jenkins has likened this to the banking industry's Uber moment.     Indeed the smartphone revolution has shifted the e-commerce landscape to a point that threatens more established players. The payments business has experienced some of the greatest changes, with platforms like PayPal, Apple (AAPL) Pay and Square (SQ) transforming the way consumers make payments.   And then there's sophisticated robo advisers like Wealthfront that can manage money automatically. Even highly paid Wall Street jobs aren't safe. New platforms like Kensho are using technology to spew up sophisticated research reports in minutes that highly paid Wall Street analysts would normally take hours to prepare.   Related: Technology could kill 5 million jobs by 2020   There's enormous sums of money being poured into such emerging financial technology. Investments in fintech has exploded to $19 billion last year from $1.8 billion in 2010, according to Citi and CB Insights. More than 70% of this investment is focused on making the customer experience better.   ""Silicon Valley is coming,"" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his 2015 annual letter. ""There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking.""     So far, traditional banks have withstood this assault pretty well. Just 1% of North American consumer banking revenue has migrated to new digital models. That's because the big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have the advantage of scale.   But Citi thinks that will change soon, especially given the sluggish business environment for traditional banks and the transformative power of new technology. This shift has already taken place in China, where Internet giants have supplanted top banks in some cases.   ""We are not even at 'the end of the beginning' of the consumer disruption cycle"" in the U.S, said Greg Baxter, Citi's global head of digital strategy.   Related: Hundreds of Bank of America branches are disappearing   By 2023, roughly 17% of North American consumer banking revenue could be impacted by digital disruption, Citi estimates. How will banks respond? In part by cutting costs -- something most big banks have already done lots of since the 2008 financial crisis.   Branches and associated staff costs make up about 65% of the total retail cost base of a larger bank, Citi said. Much of these jobs are at risk from automation.   Branch teller jobs are particularly threatened. The number of U.S. branch tellers has declined by 15% since peaking in 2007 and Citi says these losses will accelerate because some two-thirds of bank employees are doing processing work that could eventually be automated.   Even more exciting innovation could further disrupt banking jobs in the future. For instance, banks are experimenting with blockchain, the technology that Bitcoin uses to verify transactions all over the world.   Think of it like a perfect record log. Many believe that banks will eventually perfect blockchain and use it to power recordkeeping and cross-border payments.   It's another reason why futurist Amy Webb has for years been predicting the loss of many bank jobs to automation.   ""As computers become smarter, we no longer need humans as intermediaries,"" said Webb, founder of Future Today Institute.   ""Professions whose basis is in transactions will be disrupted by machines -- there is no question. And it will happen fast,"" she said. "
394,394,U.S. hospitals are getting hit by hackers,http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/23/technology/hospital-ransomware/index.html,"Mar 23, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   This time it was Methodist Hospital, an averaged-sized medical facility located in western Kentucky.   Methodist Hospital was operating ""in an internal state of emergency"" on Friday, according to its website. A section of its computer network had been rendered useless.   On March 16, the hospital got hit with ransomware, a particularly nasty type of computer virus that encrypts computer files. Hackers don't give you a key to unlock documents until they are paid a ransom.   It's only the latest medical facility to be hit this way, falling in line with a prediction by cybersecurity firm Trend Micro (TMICF) that ""2016 will be the year of online extortion.""   ""[Hospitals] have critical information and money to pay,"" said Ed Cabrera, an executive at Trend Micro. ""They're seen as easy targets.""     In a prepared statement, Methodist said ""no patient data or records were compromised."" However, it did not clarify what documents were affected.   An email laced with ransomware managed to make it past the hospital's email spam filter, according to hospital spokeswoman Brandi Schwartz.   Someone opened the email, which spread the infection into the network. The hackers demanded to be paid in Bitcoin (XBT), an electronic money that's difficult to trace.   The hospital would not say how much money was requested, but cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs revealed that hackers demanded four bitcoins -- only $1,656 at today's exchange rate.   That fits with the typical business model for ransomware hackers, who target anyone they can. These hackers don't usually focus on extorting a particularly wealthy person or company. They attack the masses, hoping to rake in a little money from lots of people.   Keeping the ransom low -- typically $300 or so -- increases the likelihood people will pay to get their files back.   But in this case, Methodist Hospital refused to pay. It simply shut down the infected part of the computer system, relying instead on backup copies of the information stored elsewhere. It took five days to get back up and running by March 21.   It's unclear whether the hospital has permanently lost files that were not backed up.   The hospital said it's now coordinating with the FBI and local Henderson Police Department.   ""Methodist Hospital would like to assure its patients that their information is safe and secure and has not been compromised in any way,"" the hospital announced.   Several American hospitals have been hit by ransomware in recent weeks, part of an alarming trend that shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.   Most notably, in February the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid a $17,000 ransom in bitcoins to get its computer systems back up and running.   Local press reports describe similar attacks at other hospitals across the country.   Zach Forsyth, an executive at cybersecurity company Comodo, said these ransomware attacks are effective because hospitals rely on antiquated technology that alerts them only after an infection has occurred.   ""It hasn't kept up with the aggressive technology innovation that cybercriminals undertake daily,"" he said. "

397,397,Why do we get paid every two weeks instead of daily?,http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/10/technology/daily-paychecks/index.html,"Feb 10, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Most people continue to get paid every two weeks or even once a month, even though the technology exists to pay people in real time or as often as they'd like.   ""It's not a technology question,"" said Jim McCarthy, who helps develop high-tech payments at Visa. ""Money is fundamentally becoming digital.""   So why hasn't money caught up with technology?      Businesses are stuck in their old ways, sorting through paper stacks to pay their bills.   That sluggish approval process -- office manager gets a paper invoice, CEO personally signs a paper check, it gets mailed -- is too ingrained in the business model right now.   That's according to René Lacerte. He's the CEO of Bill.com, which helps small businesses digitize and automate how they pay their bills.   Think of a business transaction as a huge iceberg, he said. Payment is just the tip.   ""Everything below the waterline is the process that businesses have in making decisions,"" he said. ""Everywhere you go, it's a paper-based process.""   Right now, businesses are flooded with incoming invoices. And contractors normally find themselves getting paid late, which in turn slows down how contractors pay their own employees too.   With that chaos, companies are hesitant to speed up paying their bills. Only 2% of companies that join Bill.com use the next-day bill pay feature.   Convincing them to pay employees and vendors on a daily basis would require completely ditching the existing payroll system.      Meanwhile, banks are slow at processing transactions.   Retailers have to wait several days to actually receive the money a customer spent when they swiped their credit card. And even when businesses make ""instant"" bank-to-bank transactions to pay employees or bills -- it's not really instant.   Banks rely on something called the Automated Clearing House system, an interbank payment network that dates back to the 1970s. ACH transactions only get logged a few times a day in massive batches.   ACH has several daily deadlines that seem terribly outdated. For example: Make a payment by 2 p.m. E astern Standard Time -- or it won't go through until tomorrow.   That delay is the biggest frustration to businesses right now. SurePayroll, which caters to small businesses, sees it first hand. It watches businesses take out money on Wednesday to pay employees or a bill Friday, needlessly extending the time they're short on cash.   ""Right now, the process pulls out the money too soon and gives the money too late,"" said Steve Kania, SurePayroll's vice president of strategy and product management.   ""The only people who would want to lag that time is banking, where they collect interest on the money that they move slowly,"" Kania said.      Major players are already working to solve these problems.   Visa (V) is tapping into its worldwide electronic network to start making near-instant payments called ""Visa Fast Funds."" Instead of dealing with ACH deadlines, it moves money directly from one debit card to another. By the end of 2016, the company thinks 96% of Visa debit cards will have the Fast Funds feature.   It says Facebook (FB) and Square are already using this system, absorbing the Visa fee and offering it to customers for free. This is how ride-sharing service Lyft lets drivers claim their paychecks on demand, Visa said. Lyft now lets its drivers cash out every time they've earned at least $50.   Then there's Square (SQ), which has an ""Instant Deposit"" feature for customers that get paid using Square Cash or its credit card dongle.   ""A contractor remodeling a bathroom could get a down payment, then use that to buy supplies and tiles to do the job that day,"" said Brian Grassadonia, head of Square Cash.   Another way to really speed up money is to reduce risk of fraud. The digital money system Bitcoin, which is still quite experimental, does this through an instant fact-checking accounting system called the blockchain.   ""Bitcoin has created the only real-time engine for moving value,"" said Micah Winkelspecht, whose startup Gem installs Bitcoin technology for internal use at major American banks.   Bitcoin isn't catching on as a digital currency. But it is being used successfully to quickly settle payments.   Circle, a money-sending app that works instantly, conducts trades in established currencies like dollars and euros. But on the back end, it's actually moving them across the Bitcoin network.   Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire thinks that person-to-person payment apps will be the catalyst for faster paychecks.   ""When people start experiencing personal payments the same manner they do with email and text, consumers are going to start saying, 'Why can't my company pay me this way?' It's going to be a consumer led phenomenon,"" Allaire said.   Jose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago). "

In the wake of the Paris attacks, European officials are stepping up their efforts to choke off funding for terrorists by going after large banknotes, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and pre-paid cards.   ""We have to 'follow the money' and cut off the resources these groups use to carry out their heinous crimes,"" said Frans Timmermans, a senior official at the European Commission.   ""By hitting them in their pockets we reduce their ability to travel, to buy weapons and explosives, to hide in our towns and cities, and to spread hate and fear online.""   Europe's top law enforcement officials say the 500 euro banknote (worth about $546) makes life easier for criminals.   In a report last year, Europol said cash was still the ""instrument of choice"" for terrorists, and that it was easy to move the biggest euro bill around undetected.   The European Commission said it would work with Europol and the European Central Bank, which is responsible for issuing euro banknotes, to agree ways to clamp down on cash funding for terrorism.   ECB President Mario Draghi said this week the bank could make changes to its high denomination banknotes, but it may take some time.   ""We want to make changes in an orderly fashion,"" Draghi told European lawmakers.   A spokesman at the ECB declined to comment on whether the 500 euro bill may be phased out.   The Commission also plans to regulate virtual currencies and pre-paid cards to ensure people can't remain anonymous when using these sources of funds.   It's proposing to create a ""blacklist"" of countries with a poor track record of clamping down on money laundering and terrorist financing. These countries will face additional checks when they conduct transactions with EU banks.   Related: US details financial war against ISIS   ISIS is by far the wealthiest terrorist organization on the planet, and has raked in billions of dollars by plundering banks, selling oil, taxing locals and kidnapping individuals. It has also made money by smuggling antiquities, cultural goods and illicit wildlife.   The European Commission hopes to launch a program later this year to help other countries fight trafficking of these cultural goods. "
399,399,China wants to launch its own digital currency,http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/21/technology/china-digital-currency/index.html,"Jan 22, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The People's Bank of China said it has been studying digital currencies since 2014 and reviewing what implementation would look like.   But in a statement posted on its website this week, the bank didn't give a specific timeframe for when such a currency could become a reality, nor did it say how it would work in relation to its paper currency, the yuan.   Issuing digital money could help ""reduce the high costs of circulating traditional currencies ... boost the convenience and transparency of transactions, reduce money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal acts,"" according to the statement, which summarized the findings of a special meeting on the subject in Beijing this week.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Digital currencies have been in the spotlight with the rise of Bitcoin in recent years.   Created in 2009 by an unknown person using an alias, Bitcoin allows transactions to be made without any middle men (read: no banks!). They're mined by computers -- and while there's no need to reveal your real identity, transactions are still recorded digitally.   That's given way to arguments on both sides of the aisle: Some critics say that it could help mask illicit activity, while others champion the digital trail as a way to improve transparency.   Despite the controversy, Bitcoin has caught on big in China, which houses one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCChina. Chinese regulators have largely taken a hands-off approach so far.   Related: China hemorrhaged $676 billion last year   Launching its own digital currency could help China stem and track the massive capital outflows that it's been dealing with recently.   Roughly $676 billion is estimated to have left the country last year, with about one-third of that fleeing via back-door channels to circumvent the country's strict capital controls, according to the Institute of International Finance.   Many investors have been moving money out of China as the value of the yuan has fallen amid an economic slowdown and financial market turmoil.   A digital currency could ""enhance the central bank's control of money supply and circulation,"" the bank's statement said.   Related: Nasdaq will start using Bitcoin technology   Despite Bitcoin's volatile price swings -- and even an alleged embezzlement scandal -- some governments and institutions have taken a keen interest in virtual currencies or the technology behind them.   Last year, Ecuador became the first country to start using a digital currency. And in May 2015, the Nasdaq stock exchange tapped Bitcoin's powerful transaction technology to create a more secure, efficient system to trade stocks.   The technology that powers the Bitcoin system, known as blockchain, is a computer program that automatically processes transactions and creates a perfect, reliable digital record -- a move in the right direction for more transparency.

If the company breaks the terms of its settlement, it could be on the hook for as much as $50 million, regulators said Tuesday.   Lumosity offers subscription-based access to games and activities on its website and mobile app, and the company has touted the program's ""proven"" ability to enhance brain function, ward off degenerative brain diseases, and improve academic and athletic performance.   The FTC, however, says the company didn't have evidence to back those claims, which were widely promoted through email campaigns, social media posts and advertisements, including some that appeared on CNN.   ""Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, dementia, and even Alzheimer's disease,"" FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection director Jessica Rich said. ""But Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads.""   Lumos Labs did not admit or deny wrongdoing and says it no longer uses the advertising language criticized by the FTC.   The company must notify all its subscribers of the FTC settlement and offer them an easy way to cancel auto-pay subscriptions, which cost about $15 per month.   Lumos Labs said in a statement that the settlement does not ""pertain to the rigor of our research or the quality of the products"" and it remains ""committed to moving the science of cognitive training forward.""   A slew of platforms tools that claim to boost users' brain function have popped up over the past few years, and the neuroscience community hasn't reached a consensus on the effectiveness of ""brain training"" games.   According to its website, Lumosity has 70 million ""brain trainers"" across 182 countries. "

It's the latest gimmick to bring attention to the digital currency Bitcoin, which could have serious implications for the future of tech and finance -- but is mostly being ignored by consumers.   The new iOS app is basically just a copy of the Copay app, which lets you store and trade bitcoins. The only difference? It has images that look like Tyson's famous face tattoo!   And now for the obvious question: Should you trust your money to a product associated to a man who put a tattoo on his face?   That depends on your appetite for risk.     ""Mike Tyson Bitcoin"" is the most secure kind of Bitcoin app. The user keeps the keys to Bitcoin wallets, so you're 100% in control of your money. Plus, its software is open source, which means that code flaws can be spotted and fixed in public.   But that isn't saying much. The value of a bitcoin fluctuates wildly. Almost no business out there actually accepts it as cash. And if you lose the keys to your Bitcoin wallet, you can kiss your computerized money goodbye.   Still feeling confident? The app's fine print warns, ""We cannot guarantee that there will be no bugs in the software.""   How reassuring.   That's the thing about Bitcoin. While this digital cash shows that there can indeed exist an Internet-based money system without government control, its independence also makes it relatively unreliable. The FDIC insures the money in the bank. There's no such safeguard here.   Tyson's sponsorship of this app also shows that Bitcoin isn't taking off as a serious consumer product -- even as banks start to recognize the potential of Bitcoin software.   It's just another example of today's celebrity branding on overdrive.   Kim Kardashian has vanity-themed emoji and games. Snoop Dogg lets you add marijuana joints to your otherwise boring selfie.   And now Mike Tyson lets you trade useful paper dollars into questionable computer money. "
403,403,Not everything is down. Gold rises on global fear,http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/04/investing/gold-stocks-market-fear-china-saudi-arabia-iran/index.html,"Jan 4, 2016","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Gold was one of the few things that was up on Monday while stock markets around the world tanked due to renewed worries about an economic slowdown in China and more tension in the Middle East.   The yellow metal rose nearly 2% to about $1,080 an ounce. Gold mining stocks were rallying too.   Newmont (NEM) was up 3%, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500. In fact, Newmont was one of just 23 stocks in the index that was up in late-morning trading Monday. (Most of the gainers were energy companies, thanks to a spike in oil prices.)   And the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which includes Newmont as well as other major global miners like Goldcorp (GG), Barrick (ABX) and Randgold (GOLD), was up about 3%.   It makes sense for gold to be in the green while everything else is starting off 2016 in red. Gold often does well during times of fear. It rose in 2008, for example.   Related: Dow drops 450 points   And a major slump in China coupled with concerns about a potential conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia sounds pretty scary.   ""Today's surge in gold is mostly due to fear,"" said Ed Moy, a former director of the U.S. Mint and chief strategist for Fortress Gold Group.   To that end, CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index, which looks at seven measures of investor sentiment, dipped into Fear territory on Monday.   So will 2016 be the year when fear is the dominant emotion ruling the market?   If so, that could mean an end to gold's three year losing streak.   Gold prices fell more than 10% last year and have plunged nearly 45% from their all-time high (not adjusted for inflation) of above $1,900 an ounce back in the fall of 2011.   At that time, investors were worried about the health of the U.S. market in the wake of a credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's.   Moy does not think that gold will get anywhere close to 2011 levels anytime soon.   But he thinks gold might go as high as $1,200 to $1,300 an ounce by the end of 2016.   The main reason? Concerns about a sluggish global economy aren't going away anytime soon.   Related: China rout sparks global selloff   There's also the fact that gold has been down for so long, it may finally have reached bottom.   ""A small allocation to gold does make some sense. It has done so poorly over the past few years. So there's probably not a lot of downside,"" said Bill Lynch, director of investments with Hinsdale Associates.   It all comes back to fear.   There are actually two good reasons why gold shouldn't do well this year.   Expectations of more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve should be a bad sign for gold. Higher rates would make bonds and dividend stocks more attractive to investors than gold -- which yields nothing.   There's also a lack of inflation around the world.   Gold usually is viewed as a great hedge against inflation. Rising prices can hurt the value of paper currencies, but not gold.   None of that mattered Monday though. Interestingly, Bitcoin (XBT) prices also rose Monday -- another possible sign of the high anxiety on Wall Street. (Cue the Mel Brooks.)   So gold could continue to rally this year -- despite low inflation and rising rates -- as long as investors remain nervous about China and the Middle East.   ""Hard landing fears in China are legitimate. And what happens between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a big unknown,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with BMO Private Bank. ""It's possible gold could outperform stocks this year because of the uncertainty."" "
404,404,Being blocked by Marc Andreessen is the new cool,http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/23/technology/marc-andreessen-block-twitter/index.html,"Dec 23, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The famed Silicon Valley investor appears likely to block people who think differently than he does -- and maybe pose a threat to the bubble of ideas that he wants to grow.   Andreessen's impact on the tech sector began decades ago when he helped create Netscape. His venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz has since led investments in many emerging fields, including cryptocurrency and virtual reality. He was among the earliest investors in Facebook (FB), and now sits on its board.   His influence in the tech industry has gotten him quite a following on Twitter. Andreessen became very active in January 2014. Since then, he has tweeted more than 81,000 times, gained more than 457,000 followers, and follows more than 5,600 accounts.   There were more than 1,700 tweets that contained ""blocked by @pmarca"" or ""blocked by Andreessen"" when CNNMoney looked last week.   There's even a list that tracks people who say they've been blocked, with 201 accounts on it.   All blocking on Twitter accomplishes is that blocked users can't see his tweets. So there are at least two accounts that replicate what he says: @pmarca_retweet and @rtpmarca.   So why do people think they're getting blocked?  @neeratanden @pmarca Marc is so thin skinned that he blocked me on Twitter for challenging him. Hilarious. Proud to report I've been blocked by Marc Andreessen (@pmarca ). Good idea! Shut out anyone who doubts your vision of technological #utopia! A month later, still wondering why was unfollowed AND blocked by @pmarca. 2 many Theranos/driverless car tweets? Missing the SV zeitgeist.  CNNMoney asked data analyst Michael Alatortsev, head of iTrend, to look at the accounts that have apparently been blocked. Alatortsev created the ""people blocked by @pmarca"" list and is one of those people himself.   ""There's no obvious pattern. He does not discriminate,"" Alatortsev said. ""It's all over the place.""   Many are tech journalists and writers with a lot of followers. There are investors, startup founders and entrepreneurs, people who work at large tech companies including Microsoft  (MSFT) and Twitter (TWTR), and people who have vague bios and are fairly inactive on Twitter.   Despite some theories that he may favor blocking women, fewer than 20 of the 201 accounts on the blocked list appear to belong to women. (Alatortsev only counts people who say they have been blocked.)   A spokeswoman for Andreessen said he wasn't available for comment.   Josh Felser, a tech investor, entrepreneur, and active Twitter user, says he has never noticed any bias in the way Andreessen blocks people.   ""Anyone on Twitter or Facebook has the right to curate their feed, and if there are people heckling, you have the right to kick [them] out,"" Felser told CNNMoney. ""I don't think there's a deeper meaning.""   But Andreessen doesn't just kick out people who say nasty stuff to him, according to Alatortsev. Many haven't attacked Andreessen personally.   Alatortsev said he was blocked after he tweeted about the hype over bitcoin, one focus of Andreessen's investments.   He said the problem with Andreessen and other high-level venture capitalists blocking people on Twitter is that they stop seeing ideas that they disagree with. To avoid being blocked, many people stop disagreeing with Andreessen and others like him, Alatortsev believes.   ""They've lost honest feedback and that's affecting the Silicon Valley culture,"" he said.   More than 90% of what Andreessen posts are retweets of other people. His Twitter handle also gets mentioned thousands of times a day.   Benedict Evans, who works with Andreessen at Andreessen Horowitz, has recently been criticized about his blocking habits as well.   On Wednesday, people on Twitter accused him of living in a Silicon Valley bubble and being out of touch.  This @BenedictEvans guy seems to be completely disconnected from reality. This is 2 in one week for this guy. https://t.co/PHEFwSoV6y this vc is going to sit on the board of one or many companies. he will make decisions about the direction these companies will take.  Evans defended himself in a series of followup tweets.  I'ce always tried to engage with people criticising me. Mixed results. Will shift the block threshold in 2016. For example. How does one deal with this? Correct it? Block? Ignore? https://t.co/Ryr6owCxVd In 8 years I've blocked 3500 accounts. Many bots/spammers/#marketers, some lunatics, plenty of fanboys, at least half pseudonymous.  Andreessen hasn't weighed in yet. But he has in the past shown delight over the interest of who he blocks.  @VineetDevaiah @j3slyVarghese The key to success in life is being blocked by all the right people! Passive aggressive gets blocked. Aggressive aggressive gets blocked. Aggressive does not get blocked. :-) ""And to my beloved 14th grandchild Theobald, I hereby bequeath my painstakingly curated Twitter block list...""  "
405,405,The secret hackers trying to bring down ISIS,http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/20/technology/isis-ghost-security-group/index.html,"Nov 20, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   It may have gone undetected if it weren't for a rogue hacker group called Ghost Security Group.   The group, which is made up of counterintelligence officials and computer specialists, had been monitoring the Twitter account for a month. While the under-the-radar account only had a handful of followers, many of them were high-profile ISIS members.   The hacktivist group immediately looked for intelligence contractors who could relay the info to the authorities. They found terrorist analyst Michael S. Smith II through Twitter. Smith, who works at defense consulting firm Kronos Advisory, serves as a counterterrorism adviser to members of Congress and was responsive to Ghost Security. He became the group's conduit to authorities.   According to Smith, investigators used Ghost Security's info to identify a target site, who they were targeting, and how they would execute the attack. The investigation ended with the arrest of more than a dozen terror suspects, Smith said.   ""Without a doubt, this group has saved lives. At least into the dozens,"" Smith told CNNMoney. ""There are people working in the national security community in the United States, Europe, the Middle East ... who will never be credited with that.""   FBI Director James Comey has repeatedly said that ISIS' use of social media is unprecedented in terms of how aggressively it engages with people in the West. Its members are essentially overwhelming the system, Smith said, which means there's room for outside support from groups like Global Security.   But in order for these groups to be effective, they have to coordinate with those who ""have the mandates ... to find, finish and fix the enemy,"" said Smith. (The FBI would not comment on Ghost Security's involvement in digitally tracking terrorists.)   Related: Top questions asked on the ISIS help desk   Ghost Security differentiates itself from the vast and often disjointed hacktivist collective Anonymous, which has also declared war on ISIS and claims to have taken down pro-ISIS Twitter accounts. A handful of members were previously part of Anonymous, including one of the leaders, who goes by the name ""DigitaShadow."" He says Ghost Security is small and more focused.    ""We have structure and leadership,"" he told CNNMoney. ""We also have a lot of counterterrorism experience. We have translators, linguists, research analysts on hand to analyze all the data that we receive.""   DigitaShadow has taken on the role of executive director and helps organize and assign tasks to the 14 members of Ghost Security who are scattered around the world. He also provides electronic equipment for the group. Ghost Security also works with another group, CtrlSec, which helps monitor the social media of terrorists.   Ghost Security was formed following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris last January. DigitaShadow said it's a full time job for the members, who are scattered around the world. Even though they're just volunteers, they work an average of 16 hours a day.   ""We realized for the first time, you could be [attacked] in the streets of Paris and attacked in [your] hometown in America,"" DigitaShadow said. ""Everybody could become a victim. So we wanted to do what we could to help slow them down.""   Related: Terrorists hide plans by 'going dark'   DigitaShadow says Ghost Security has taken down 149 Islamic State propaganda sites, 110,000 social media accounts, and over 6,000 propaganda videos since it formed. Following the most recent attacks in Paris, the crew is trying to gather intel on the attackers' digital footprints and identify social media accounts involved in the attacks. (CNN could not independently confirm this information.)   Ghost Security claims to have created automated software that identifies ISIS social media accounts. DigitaShadow says the collective has also infiltrated private ISIS communications, taken over ISIS social media accounts and pulled IP information to help identify and locate ISIS members. Ghost Security is primarily focused on bringing down ISIS, but they also target other Islamic extremists.   According to Smith, the group also identified and traced two brothers in Saudi Arabia who filmed themselves executing someone to demonstrate their support for ISIS. The group was able to take control of the Twitter account that uploaded the execution video and find information about the mobile device, which allowed authorities to locate the killers. (The two brothers were killed before U.S. intelligence acted on the information, according to Smith.)   After connecting with Smith this summer and funneling information to officials, the group changed some of its tactics to operate more lawfully -- it now sees itself as gathering valuable data to send to authorities. While Smith says operations are done legally, there's a fine line.   ""Is hacking illegal? Absolutely,"" DigitaShadow said. ""Is fighting ISIS to try to stop threats and stop their propaganda -- would that be considered illegal? It falls into a giant gray area.""   The Ghost Security team is working around the clock. They aren't compensated but do receive some bitcoin donations.   Despite struggling to make ends meet, DigitaShadow says they won't stop.   ""If we were to stop now, lives would be at risk. It's not a choice, it's more of a way of life for us now."" "
406,406,JPMorgan's accused hackers had vast $100 million operation,http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/10/technology/jpmorgan-hack-charges/index.html,"Nov 10, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The Justice Department announced Tuesday that three men indicted for separate crimes in July are behind the enormous JPMorgan hack. The three men allegedly stole 83 million customers' personal information in that data breach.   The JPMorgan hack was ""the largest theft of customer data from a U.S. financial institution in history,"" according to the prosecutors.   Until now, nobody knew who did it -- or why.   Law enforcement officials initially said the attacks came from hackers in Russia with loose ties to the Russian government.   But today's announcement paints a different picture. The U.S. government now alleges that the hack was orchestrated by men involved in a pump-and-dump stock manipulation scheme.   Why hack a bank for a pump-and-dump? Data breaches are information-gathering expeditions. They yield sensitive data that's extremely valuable to criminals. Breaking into the bank gave them information to target specific people -- and extra insight into the stock market, federal agents said.     An indictment unsealed Tuesday claims it went far beyond that, though. Investigators say they took down a massive criminal empire that hacked seven major banks, ran an online casino, laundered money around the world and set up an illegal Bitcoin trading operation.   They allegedly made more than $100 million -- and used 75 shell companies that employed hundreds of people, and 30 fake passports from 17 countries to keep it secret.   Federal documents point to Gery Shalon, an Israeli citizen, as the mastermind behind this vast criminal syndicate. Ziv Orenstein, another Israeli, was his right hand man who used fake documents to setup dummy accounts around the globe. Joshua Samuel Aaron, an American, was another key figure.   Together they ran a fraudulent investment business, according to law enforcement. They would buy lots of a penny stock, then blast out misleading emails to dupe others into buying a company's stock too and quickly drive up its price. Then they would cash out before the inevitable crash. They made their riches this way -- one time scooping up $2 million in a single exit, federal documents say.   To get email addresses of potential victims, Shalon hired a hacker to break into banks and steal client lists. From 2012 to 2015 they broke into JPMorgan, Scottrade, Dow Jones (the publisher of the Wall Street Journal), a major mutual fund in Boston, Massachusetts, another financial news organization, and online stock brokerages in Omaha, Nebraska; Queens, New York; and Charlotte, North Carolina.   JPMorgan, Scottrade and Dow Jones confirmed that they had been victims of the group's hacks.   Sources have previously told CNNMoney that the FBI investigated hacks on seven of the top 15 banks.   But their biggest hack was JPMorgan. Although the federal documents does not mention it by name, JPMorgan (JPM) acknowledged to CNNMoney that it was the major victim of these attacks.   The unsealed indictment didn't detail exactly how Shalon managed to hack into banks. But it did say that they were able to break into the mutual fund in April 2014 because the company didn't quickly patch its computers to protect them from last year's notorious Heartbleed bug.   Investigators also claim Shalon ran an illegal online gambling operation, using hacks to ruin competitors. Plus, he allegedly owned a shady firm that processed payments for illegal pharmaceutical suppliers.   Investigators also claim Shalon operated an unlicensed online Bitcoin exchange out of Florida. At Coin.mx, you could trade cash for the digital currency. That electronic money is hard to trace, so it's the way hackers like to get paid for doing illegal jobs.   Orenstein and Shalon were arrested by Israeli police on July 21 and remain in that country. American prosecutors are trying to extradite them to the United States.   Police didn't catch Aaron, who remains a fugitive. Investigators would not say if they know where he is hiding.   The U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, detailed the case at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. He said this case represents how criminals are using high-tech tools to boost their power -- and make crimes painfully difficult to solve.   ""This showcases a brave new world of hacking for profit,"" Bharara said. ""It was securities fraud on steroids.""   Bharara noted that major hacks often go unresolved. ""We believe we can change that narrative,"" he said. "
407,407,Record $1 billion invested in Bitcoin firms so far,http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/02/technology/bitcoin-1-billion-invested/index.html,"Nov 2, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   American Express (AXP), Bain Capital, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs (GS), MasterCard (MA), the New York Life Insurance Company, the New York Stock Exchange -- all of them have poured millions of dollars into Bitcoin firms recently.   Overall, a record-breaking $1 billion so far has been pumped into Bitcoin-related tech startups. Banks are investing in the technology that powers Bitcoin, but not the currency itself.   This technology promises to change the way we trade stocks, send money to each other, get paid at work, and much more.   What powers the Bitcoin network is an incredible system called the blockchain. It's the reason the software can verify transactions all over the world. That's what's attractive to banks and high-tech firms.   It's essentially a perfect record log. That same record log lives on every computer on the Bitcoin network. And it gets updated every few minutes with a new ""block"" of transactions. The thing is, the next block is built on top of the old one, so you can't just go in and change old data.   It's a effective way to stop fraud.   That's hugely different from today, where records are centralized. Hack into a bank, and it's easy to falsify them. But the blockchain keeps the same record in lots of computers. A fake record would be immediately spotted by every other computer on the network.   There are all sorts of purposes for this kind of record keeping.   Nasdaq is tapping blockchain technology to create a more secure, efficient system to trade stocks.   DocuSign, a company that specializes in electronic contracts, just unveiled a joint idea with Visa to use blockchain to track car rentals and reduce paperwork.   Next week, Microsoft  (MSFT)will unveil details about its venture into ""smart contracts"" that use blockchain technology. It's partnering up with Ethereum, a blockchain project that operates outside of Bitcoin but uses the same concept. Microsoft wants to incorporate that into its Azure service, which rents out computer servers.   Meanwhile, this new obsession with blockchain technology has reached a point that companies are even experimenting with creating smaller, ""private blockchains"" inside their own offices. They hire companies like BlockCypher, a startup out of Redwood City, California.   Among the top of the list is Chain, a company that helps others apply the blockchain to their business. Earlier this year, it raised $30 million from Capital One (COF), Citi (C) Ventures, the Nasdaq (BANK) stock exchange, Visa (V) and others.   The appetite became most apparent last week at Money2020, the largest financial conference in the world. One in five attendees at the conference thought Bitcoin's blockchain technology will have the biggest impact on financial services in the next three to five years, according to a Capital One survey.   What's driving that investment rally? Stodgy banking and venture capital companies are finally embracing the technology instead of demonizing it as weird and dangerous.   Sure, Bitcoin has anti-establishment roots. It's an all-digital currency. It belongs to no country. It's recognized by no government as ""legal tender."" It was created anonymously online.   But it's moving beyond its initial devotees, militant libertarians who hate central banks.   And there's now a way for investors to get into the action. Just last week was the launch of Digital Currency Group, which claims to have ""the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain ecosystem."" It's led by Barry Silbert, an entrepreneur who specializes in creating markets for difficult-to-trade items. Silbert launched the firm with financial help from Bain Capital, MasterCard and others.   Silbert's funding round helped push the total amount raised in Bitcoin-related companies to just over $1 billion last month, according to several venture capital firms involved in the space.   ""This signals a broad endorsement that the blockchain is of critical importance to financial innovation,"" Will O'Brien, a senior strategic advisor to venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, told CNNMoney. ""The early days of dismissing Bitcoin as a tulip bubble are behind us.""   And this is why the price of Bitcoin -- which peaked at $1,151 two years ago and now hovers at $328 -- just isn't that important.   The technology lives on.

Some of those included police chiefs, government bureaucrats -- and federal prosecutors.   And that's where Andrew Auernheimer comes in.   Auernheimer is notorious in the hacking world.   Back in 2010, Auernheimer discovered that AT&T was inadvertently exposing iPad users' personal information online. He went public with that information. As a result, he got arrested and was sentenced to three and a half years in a federal prison for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.   Civil rights lawyers joined his cause and won a court appeal after Auernheimer had spent years in prison. He became a cause célèbre for hackers and Internet freedom.   Angry and bitter -- and trying to stay as far away from American law enforcement as possible -- Auernheimer has roamed the Middle East and Eastern Europe since then, getting by on supporters' donations in the digital currency Bitcoin.   On Thursday, Auernheimer wrote an email to two federal prosecutors in New Jersey whose office put him behind bars. CNNMoney was copied on that message.   ""You have yet to apologize and make amends,"" Auernheimer wrote. He then criticized the prosecutors for so aggressively targeting hackers and protesters.   ""I have a message for you and federal prosecutors around the country: We are going to leak information to expose you all in the next days for the lying cheaters that you are,"" Auernheimer wrote.   To find the names, Auernheimer looked through the exposed Ashley Madison database, which is now public.   Auernheimer said he plans to expose two federal prosecutors in New Jersey -- and one in every other office around the country in the coming weeks.   Auernheimer said the information will be posted Thursday on an alternative, anti-establishment news website, GotNews.com.   The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey declined to comment, but officials said they were aware of the situation.   It's unclear if his actions violate any laws. He's not trying to extort them, the information is public and having an Ashley Madison account is legal.     CNNMoney spoke to Auernheimer and asked why he's still angry. Here's how he described his life.   ""I used to make six figures,"" he said. ""Then I was kidnapped from my childhood home of Fayetteville, Arkansas, at gunpoint. My home was bulldozed. Three years of my life was stolen under false pretense. I was subject to beatings, false imprisonment, and extensive periods in solitary confinement, the latter of which is proven extensively in medical literature to cause permanent neurological damage. And now I am a destitute refugee with no home.""   And why seek revenge?   ""It will lessen their lives,"" he responded. ""Federal prosecutors and their homes should be targets in every sense of the word. They are criminal slime, and they should receive every bit of damage back to them that they do to society."" "
409,409,Police: High-tech criminals have us outmatched and outgunned,http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/02/technology/criminal-tech/index.html,"Oct 2, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," In its new report, the European Cybercrime Centre paints a stark picture.   We're witnessing ""the increased professionalization of cybercriminals,"" writes European Police Office director Rob Wainwright.   First of all, when dirty money exchanges hands, it's harder to track. Crooks are increasingly using electronic money, such as Bitcoin, which is hard to trace. There's no middleman, no central player like a bank tracking customer transfers by name.   Second, underground marketplaces online are getting smarter. They're now decentralized too. No one person is in control. There's no single computer server to shut down, no dragon's head to chop off.   Third, it's harder for police to eavesdrop on criminals, because they now regularly encrypt their conversations. Email, online chats -- everything is encoded.   ""The speed at which society and crime 'cyberize' exceed the speed at which law enforcement can adapt,"" the Europol report states.      Criminals love using electronic cash. Bitcoin only got popular in 2013, but it already makes up 40% of all criminal-to-criminal payments online, according to Europol.   Bitcoin is also used in 33% of all online extortion cases, such as when hackers lock personal computer files and demand a ransom.   ""Although there is no single common currency used by cybercriminals across the EU, it is apparent that Bitcoin may gradually be taking on that role,"" the report says.   What's surprising is that Bitcoin isn't exactly anonymous. Every transfer is recorded publicly. Attaching a transaction to a name, however, is difficult.   And when they don't use digital money, criminals rely on other hard-to-trace options. They trade computer viruses with stolen credit cards. They rent out corporate computer servers with prepaid debit cards. They cash out with Western Union wire transfers.      Kill one black market, and the next one pops right up.   In late 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road, a massive eBay for drugs. Shortly thereafter, someone launched an identical Silk Road 2.0.   It's been a cat-and-mouse game ever since. The latest major operation was in November 2014, when Europol teamed up with the FBI and took down 33 illegal marketplaces. They arrested 17 people and seized $1.3 million worth of Bitcoin, cash, drugs and gold.   But now police are starting to see marketplaces like OpenBazaar. It's a peer-to-peer operation, just sellers and buyers. There's no kingpin to arrest. Europol compares OpenBazaar to BitTorrent, where people trade pirated movies and music.   The fight against OpenBazaar is going just about as well as the fight against illegally copied media (not well).   The best thing going for law enforcement? A lack of honor among thieves. The black market site Sheep Marketplace shut down in 2013 when its founders skipped off with $48 million in customers' bitcoins. The same thing happened to mega-marketplace Evolution in March of this year, with the site's operators stealing $12 million.   ""Exit scams ... create an additional dimension of distrust,"" which helps scare some would-be criminals away from online black markets Europol noted.      It's also easier than ever to disguise conversations. The best smartphones now automatically protect data by encoding it. Devices wipe themselves clean if anyone tries to break in. These features protect consumers but also shield criminals.   ""Encryption, anonymization and anti-forensic tools ... use of these methods among offenders is no longer the exception but the norm,"" the Europol report says.   Cybercrime investigators run into encryption more than 75% of the time. They've also seen a noticeable increase in the use of PGP, a method that makes emails unreadable unless you know a passcode.   Breaking encryption isn't easy. It's a task better suited to spies than police.   The FBI is currently asking U.S. companies to insert backdoors that give the agency quiet access to people's private devices (and Sillicon Valley has pushed back hard). European police are not advocating such an aggressive policy -- acknowledging that encryption keeps the public safe from hackers.   But Europol is asking politicians and academics to propose solutions.   ""The right to privacy is gaining ground at the expense of the right to protection,"" Europol says in the report.

410,410,There's a new way to invest in Bitcoin -- But buyer beware,http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/18/investing/bitcoin-investing-etf/index.html,"Sep 18, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Buying actual bitcoins has proven dangerous, to say the least. Just look at the unbelievable turbulence in Bitcoin prices -- the currency's value shot up 6,000% in one year before collapsing in value -- and the alleged fraud at the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange that led many investors to lose money.   In theory, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that mirrors the price of Bitcoin would offer a somewhat safer alternative. Think: something akin to SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which tracks gold prices.   But no Bitcoin ETFs have been created. An effort by the twins Cameron and Tyle Winklevoss to do just that has been waiting two years to receive approval from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission is still trying to figure out how to define and oversee Bitcoin.   This week, ARK Investment Management announced a full embrace of the digital currency. Its ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW) became the first ETF to invest in bitcoins.   ""Current prices present an attractive entry point for our investors,"" Cathie Wood, ARK's founder and chief investment officer, said in a statement.   But before taking a leap, it would be smart to read the fine print of the ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol ""ARKW.""   First, it's not a pure play on Bitcoin. Even though it announced the Bitcoin play, the ETF is actually an investment in what it calls disruptive technologies. The crypto currency represents just a slice of its holdings, packaged along with Netflix (NFLX), LinkedIn (LNKD) and athenahealth (ATHN), a cloud-based provider of electronic health records.   Related: Chinese gamblers are all about Bitcoin trading      Second, the ARK ETF is not actually investing directly in bitcoins. It's buying shares of something called the Bitcoin Investment Trust. Most people haven't even heard of that.   That trust started trading in May on the pink sheets under the ticker symbol ""GBTC."" It's got a market valuation of under $40 million and very little trading volume.   The pink sheets, also known as the over-the-counter market, provide less transparency and oversight from regulators. They're like a Wild West alternative to the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.   ""Pink sheets are where most investors aren't willing to tread,"" said Matt Hougan, CEO of ETF.com, a research firm.   GrayScale, which sponsored the Bitcoin trust, defended the decision to list on the pink sheets and noted that a number of major foreign companies such as Adidas (ADDDF) and Roche (RHHBF) list their U.S. shares there.   Related: Winklevoss twins say Bitcoin will explode beyond $1 trillion      Another problem is that the investment hasn't really mirrored the price of Bitcoin, which defeats the purpose. At times the trust's shares have spiked or surged -- even though underlying Bitcoin prices were relatively calm.   ""You're not really getting Bitcoin here. You're getting a Bitcoin derivative that kind of tracks the price of Bitcoin -- but not really well,"" said Hougan. ""There are a bunch of leaps of faith in that chain of command.""   The ETF company brushed away these concerns, suggesting that price volatility is actually a good sign.   Another risk for the investment is regulatory. The trust warns investors in disclosure documents that its future may be jeopardized by looming regulation from the SEC.   Related: Former fed in Silk Road case stole $820,000 in bitcoins      All of this is on top of the inherent risk that goes into investing in anything that has volatility of Bitcoin.   Founded in 2009, Bitcoin burst onto the financial scene this decade as investors looked for an alternative to traditional currencies. Prices skyrocketed more than 6,000% in 2013 before peaking at nearly $1,250.   And then prices collapsed, losing two-thirds of their value last year alone. While Bitcoin has actually calmed down a lot lately, it's still down 27% this year to $230 apiece. "

The hackers have also released financial information about the company that runs it, Avid Life Media, and the emails of its CEO.   Here are the latest developments in the Ashley Madison hack. Last updated: September 11, 2015 (11:34 am ET).   1. 11 million Ashley Madison passwords were uncovered by a password-cracking squad known as CynoSure Prime, after they discovered half of customers' login information was not properly secured.   2. Noel Biderman, the CEO of Ashley Madison's parent company Avid Life Media Inc., stepped down on Friday, August 28.   3. Avid Life Media, which is based in Toronto, is offering $500,000 (Canadian dollars) to anyone with information that leads to the identification of the hackers.   4. Toronto Police are investigating two suicides they say may be linked to the hack. In the United States, a San Antonio police captain ended his life days after his information was exposed, but the San Antonio Police Department would not comment on whether it was linked to the leak. Baptist leader John Gibson committed suicide on August 24, six days after learning that his name was on the list of exposed Ashley Madison customers.   5. Emails and other private information of some 15,000 U.S. government workers are exposed. Among them: Multiple Department of Justice lawyers and an IT specialist for the Department of Homeland Security who used personal email accounts but accessed government computer servers.   6. The government accounts include some with .mil emails. Adultery is against the Code of Conduct for members of the U.S. armed forces. Defense Secretary Ash Carter says on August 20 that the Pentagon is investigating.   7. Spammers try to extort people whose information was made public. One group, for example, sends emails to Ashley Madison users demanding one bitcoin (around $225) to prevent information from being shared.   8. Several people directly affected by the data breach tell CNNMoney the stolen documents contain information that will be used in divorce proceedings. Exposed customers are concerned about getting fired from their jobs.   9. Avid Life Media tries to stop the spread of the leaked data. It issues copyright takedown notices to multiple sites that hosted or linked to stolen information, including Twitter.   10. The hackers release their third batch of stolen information on August 21, fixing a file containing Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman's emails that had been corrupted.   11. Information containing Biderman's emails is released on August 20, but the file becomes corrupted so it can't be fully accessed by the public.   12. Two Canadian law firms say on August 20 that they have filed a $760 million suit against Avid Life Media. The lead plaintiff is described as a ""disabled widower"" who briefly joined the site after the death of his wife but never met anybody in person.   13. The stolen database of people who used Ashley Madison makes its way to the Web on August 19, making it easily searchable on several websites.   14. The first data dump is discovered on August 18. The hackers post the names, partial credit card numbers, email and physical addresses, and sexual preferences of 32 million customers on the so-called Dark Web, meaning they are public but hard to find for ordinary Internet users.   15. The hack is revealed by security expert Brian Krebs in a blog post on July 16. Hackers calling themselves the ""Impact Team"" say they will release sensitive data if the site is not shut down. Avid Life Media says on July 20 it is working with law enforcement in the United States and in Canada, where the company is based.

At the time of its closure, Mt.Gox said that it was unable to locate 850,000 bitcoins, the vast majority of which belonged to customers. It later claimed to have found 200,000 bitcoins in a ""forgotten"" digital wallet.   The public prosecutor's office in Tokyo, which brought charges against Karpeles on Friday, would not confirm the exact amount of currency that remains missing.

Shaun Bridges, a former Secret Service agent with the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.   This follows a guilty plea in July by another former Secret Service agent, Carl Force, who admitting to money laundering and stealing $700,000 in bitcoins.   Both were part of the investigation of Ross Ulbricht, also known as Dread Pirate Roberts, who created the underground website Silk Road.   Silk Road served as an online and anonymous marketplace for cocaine, LSD, hacking tutorials and other illegal products. In May, Ulbricht, who took his moniker from the movie ""The Princess Bride,"" was sentenced to life in prison.   Silk Road dealt in Bitcoin, an electronic currency that is not backed by any government. Bitcoin is often used for illegal purchases because some of its users believe it's untraceable. It is also used for legitimate purchases, though not all businesses recognize it. The value of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since its creation in 2008.   According to the government, Bridges fraudulently accessed Silk Road and stole 20,000 bitcoins, which were then worth about $350,000. He then moved the bitcoins into an account of Mt.Gox, a Japan-based Bitcoin exchange that shut down in 2014 after hundreds of millions of bitcoins in the exchange mysteriously disappeared.   When Bridges cashed out his stolen bitcoins nearly a year before Mt.Gox vanished, their value had jumped to $820,000.   His lawyer, Steve Levin, said Bridges is taking ""responsibility"" for his actions.   ""During an otherwise stellar career that spanned several years, Mr. Bridges exercised poor judgment on one single day, over the course of a few short hours, and will have to live with the consequences for the rest of his life,"" Levin said.

414,414,T-Mobile CEO lashes out against 'data thieves',http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/31/technology/tmobile-data-theives/index.html,"Aug 31, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   In an open letter to T-Mobile customers with an unusually furious tone, Legere said that some customers are using special software to skirt past T-Mobile's data limits. He said if they continue to abuse the network, they'll be kicked off T-Mobile's unlimited data plans.   Here's the issue: Along with unlimited smartphone data, T-Mobile (TMUS) allots 7 GB of extra ""hotspot"" data each month to customers of its Simple Choice unlimited plans. Customers can use that extra 7 GB to turn their phones into Wi-Fi hotspots, connecting their laptops or other gadgets to the Internet. But when they blow past 7 GB of data their speed will be throttled down until their next billing cycle.   Legere said that some customers have been using software tricks to mask the fact that they're using their phones as hotspots. That makes T-Mobile think that they're using all that data on their phone's unlimited data plan.   ""These aren't naive amateurs; they are clever hackers who are willfully stealing for their own selfish gain,"" Legere said. ""I'm not sure what they are doing with it -- stealing wireless access for their entire business, powering a small cloud service, providing broadband to a small city, mining for bitcoin -- but I really don't care!""   He said some customers have used as much as 2,000 GB of hotspot data in a single month, ""stealing data so blatantly and extremely that it is ridiculous."" That has a negative impact on other customers, he said, since using all that data can slow speeds for everyone else.   So T-Mobile developed a technology that can determine which customers are skirting the rules. If they don't heed T-Mobile's warning, they'll be barred from the company's unlimited plans.   ""We are going after every thief,"" said Legere. ""No more abuse and no risk to the rest of our customers' experience. It's over. Count on it!""   Sprint CEO calls 'bulls**t' on T-Mobile's CEO   Legere is walking a fine line, because the FCC has been very clear on this topic.   The commission fined AT&T $100 million for misleading mobile customers about its ""unlimited"" data plans, throttling data speeds after customers hit a certain data cap. Tracfone also got hit with a $40 million in January for falsely advertising its unlimited plan.   A year ago, Verizon (VZ) abandoned plans to slow down 4G connection speeds for unlimited data plan customers after FCC Commissioner Tom Wheeler openly called the plan ""disturbing."" The FCC issued a similar notice to T-Mobile last year, which improved its notifications when it throttles unlimited plan customers.   ""Unlimited means unlimited,"" said FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc when AT&T (T) was fined in June. ""The Commission is committed to holding accountable those broadband providers who fail to be fully transparent about data limits.""   Legere, in a seemingly proactive defense against the FCC, opened his statement to T-Mobile customers by saying, ""I want to make sure I am being really clear and transparent on this issue as we take action.""   He said the FCC's argument about data throttling is separate from T-Mobile's actions to stop customers from masking their hotspot usage.   ""These abusers will probably try to distract everyone by waving their arms about throttling data,"" Legere said. ""Make no mistake about it -- this is not the same issue. Don't be duped by their sideshow.""   Legere said the number of customers who are taking part in data masking is about a hundredth of a percent of the company's 59 million customers. That's fewer than 6,000 customers in total, and Legere said the company is going to serve warnings Monday to ""the 3,000 users who know exactly what they are doing.""   In an FAQ, the company said it is ""absolutely not"" doing this to extract extra money out of its heaviest users. ""In fact, customers who are moved to a new plan will be paying less than they paid for on their old plan.""   ""If their activities are left unchecked their actions could eventually have a negative effect on the experience of honest T-Mobile customers,"" Legere said. ""Not on my watch."" "

On Tuesday, hackers released the private information of customers who'd used the online service, which connects people seeking to have affairs.   By Friday, extortionists had begun targeting some of those users.   Rick Romero, an IT specialist who runs an email provider called VFEmail, uncovered spammers trying to use the service to target victims of the Ashley Madison hack.   People can use VFEmail to create a free email account. Romero said it's not uncommon for spammers to sign up to send bulk emails. Friday morning, he said his spam filter flagged a series of mass emails sent to Ashley Madison victims, first reported by Krebs on Security.   ""Unfortunately your data was leaked in the recent hacking of Ashley Madison and I now have your information,"" the extortion email read.     The group requested one bitcoin (around $225) to prevent the information from being shared with the user's significant other.   The message said users have seven days before being exposed.   ""It looked like they attempted to send about 1,500 or 2,000 [messages] through my service,"" Romero told CNNMoney. ""They probably filtered the database for recent log-ins.""   While Romero's filter prevented many of these emails from going out, he estimated that around 500 were sent before the filter was activated.   It's the latest fallout from the security breach. Much of the stolen database, which was initially posted on the dark web (which is accessible through a special browser called Tor) has made its way to the open web. Along with extortion, victims risk identity theft, as many personal details like addresses and partial credit card information are now available.

""I think this was rhetoric and an exaggeration, but it shows the high stakes politics involved.""   Related: $2 gas will be back after Iran nuclear deal      Recently, Kerry and Obama have argued that if the Iran deal doesn't pass, the U.S. would be forced to slap sanctions on anyone doing business with Iran going forward. That could be some of the world's largest banks or even our allies in Europe or China if they forge ahead with the deal and America doesn't.   That would not go down well. The fear is that these nations and banks might retaliate by ditching the dollar as their currency of choice.   Here's President Obama explaining it in an August 5 speech at American University:   ""We'd have to cut off countries like China from the American financial system. And since they happen to be major purchasers of or our debt, such actions could trigger severe disruptions in our own economy and, by the way, raise questions internationally about the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency,"" he said.      No question, such a situation could get ugly, but experts say the dollar isn't going anywhere.   What, after all are the alternatives? The euro? The Japanese yen? China's yuan? Bitcoin? They just aren't ready for that prime time role.   ""The euro is too young and has suffered for Greece's long troubles,"" says John Kicklighter, chief currency strategist at DailyFX. ""The Japanese yen is mired in decades of deflation in part due to fall out of its savings and loan crisis, and China proved again that the yuan is not ready after its large devaluation.""   The world received another reminder today of just how far off China still is from being a world reserve currency after its central bank devalued its yuan about 2% overnight with more or less a hand wave.   The dollar is especially strong right now because people trust it. Iran deal or no deal, that's unlikely to change.   Related: China devalues yuan in shocking move      Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves in the world, and it's eager for the end of sanctions so it can start exporting again. The expectation is that oil and gas prices are likely to fall further if that happens.   What's unlikely to change is that oil (and copper and diamonds and every other commodity) will continue to be traded in U.S. dollars, deal or no deal.   ""The [dollar] still comprises the bulk of reserves around the world and is the primary transactional currency for natural resources,"" says Kicklighter.   If major events like the financial crisis and the downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard & Poor's in 2011 didn't cause the dollar to lose its status as the world's ""go to"" reserve currency, the Iran deal isn't going to do it, either.   There are a lot of valid economic debates, let alone political ones, to have about the Iran nuclear deal. The impact on the U.S. dollar isn't one of them. "

The digital currency has been embraced by Chinese users who like to take a gamble: It's all ""about trading, about volatility, about making a profit -- buy low, sell high,"" said Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCChina, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange.   Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions can be made without any middle men (read: no banks!), and there's no need to give your real name. People can buy bitcoins with real money, purchase things with bitcoins and even trade them on exchanges, much like trading a company's stock.   It's caught on fast in China, which boasts the world's highest penetration of smartphones. Roughly 80% of Bitcoin volume is exchanged into and out of Chinese yuan, according to a report by Goldman Sachs.   Lee sees the digital currency's boom as part of a broader explosion of gambling in Asia, much of it driven by the Chinese. Macau's casino industry, for example, is seven times larger than that of Las Vegas.   ""China will continue to have the world's largest share of Bitcoin trading,"" Lee said. ""Why is Macau the world's largest gambling market? It's not because Macau has the most casinos ... it's because Chinese are so interested in gambling!""   Related: What is bitcoin?

It wasn't the first time Beijing acted to curb alternative currencies. The central bank also took a dim view of the QQ coin, a popular virtual currency created by Chinese tech company Tencent. The government restricted its use to virtual products in 2009.

However,  it lost 13 times that amount the next year, when it also handed more than  $5 million to the U.S. government for allegedly lying on bank documents. At the time of its closure, Mt.Gox said that it couldn't find 850,000 bitcoins, leaving angry customers out of pocket. However, soon after, the company said it had recovered 200,000 bitcoins -- worth about $56 million at today's rates -- from an old-format wallet used before June 2011. That reduced the number of missing bitcoins to 650,000, or around $183 million at current rates. What is Bitcoin? CNN's Radina Gigova contributed to this report "
419,419,You can hack this high-tech rifle,http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/29/technology/hack-smart-rifle/index.html,"Jul 29, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   TrackingPoint makes an expensive smart rifle that easily lets novices hit targets a half mile away. It lets you digitally ""tag"" a target, then locks the trigger until the gun is perfectly positioned to nail it. And it connects to smartphones or tablets so a buddy can view what the shooter sees in the scope.   Now, two security researchers have discovered software flaws in the computerized rifle. Anyone near enough for a Wi-Fi connection to a rifle can remotely tinker with controls.   In the worst case, a hacker could force a police sniper to miss while shooting directly at a hostage-taking criminal -- and hit the hostage instead. Or a hacker could simply lock the rifle's controls, rendering it useless.   There's a major point worth noting, though: A hacker can't make the rifle shoot on its own. The barrel can't be forced to move in a different direction. But the bullet can.   Husband-and-wife computer security researcher team Michael Auger and Runa Sandvik explained their discovery to CNNMoney.   It started last summer, when they stopped by TrackingPoint's booth at the Nation's Gun Show just west of Washington, D.C.   ""We were reading their marketing material that said you could connect it to your phone,"" she recalled. A gun with a wireless connection? Alarms bells went off inside her head. ""That's when I suggested we buy one and hack it.""   They purchased a lower-end Precision-Guided .308 model, which retails for $12,995.     Auger opened the computerized scope and studied the hardware. They soon discovered glaring problems.   One: every rifle has a built-in, default network password that can't be changed. That's bad enough for home Wi-Fi. This is worse.   Two: the rifle is always listening for remote instructions -- allowing administrative access that should only belong to the actual shooter holding the weapon.   Auger and Sandvik recently experimented with this at a gun range in West Virginia. First came the test shot. Auger fired the rifle once and hit a bullseye at 50 yards. Then, from her computer nearby, Sandvik tapped into the rifle and tricked it into thinking the 175-grain bullet was 2,857 times heavier.   Auger took the same shot. This time, the bullet landed dead center -- on a target 30 inches to the left.   They didn't just trick the rifle to miss. They tricked it to miss -- just right. They can pull off the same thing by quietly adjusting the rifle's wind and temperature readings.   ""Unless you're really familiar with the rifle and know what you're doing, you probably won't notice those variables are changing,"" Sandvik said. ""You'll be too focused lining up your shot.""   What makes this hack so surprising is that it's relatively easy to pull off.   Want to sabotage someone's shot by readjusting temperature and wind settings? You just need to download the widely available TrackingPoint mobile app, stand near a smart-rifle-toting shooter and know the default password -- which Sandvik claims has already been published online.   Want to do even more damage? You'll have to reverse-engineer the hardware. But as soon as you do, you can lock the trigger, adjust the bullet weight or shut the whole thing down. And someone is bound to publish this online. That's how hardware hacking works.   Auger and Sandvik will reveal more details about their research at the Black Hat cybersecurity convention next week in Las Vegas.   At that point, anyone will be able to independently discover the rifle's weaknesses and exploit it themselves. That is, unless TrackingPoint intends to fix the flaw.   Sandvik said she spoke to the company on Sunday, and ""they seemed... interested in fixing the issues we identified.""   However, TrackingPoint did not acknowledge these problems to CNNMoney -- or answer any of our questions about possible fixes.   CNN's Aaron Smith contributed to this report.

Welcome to PorcFest—short for Porcupine Freedom Festival—the annual gathering of libertarians, anarchists and other freedom lovers who are part of a ongoing plan to convince thousands of Americans to move to New Hampshire to make the ""Live Free or Die"" state even, well, freer.   For the past 12 years, supporters of the Free State Project, a movement that aims to bring 20,000 people to commit to settle here, have gathered in the northern woods of New Hampshire for a week to network, study Austrian economics, strategize and show the world that they can create a stateless society. So far, the group says more than 16,000 people have joined the cause. Once they reach the 20,000-person goal, the pledgers have five years to fulfill their promise.  Being Moody: Historians baffled by handprint on Declaration of Independence ""I hope and believe we can build a beacon of liberty here in New Hampshire,"" Carla Gericke, the Free State Project's president, told CNN.  While progress has been slow, more than 1,000 people have already moved here to prepare the way for the rest, and a handful of Free Staters have even been elected to the New Hampshire state legislature.   At Porcfest, precious metals and crypto-currencies like Bitcoin—not Federal Reserve dollars—are the preferred mode of currency. Attendees buy, barter and sell their wares, food and services in an open market in the middle of camp. A vending machine is available at all hours that provides everything from ammunition and silver bars to tampons and Milk Duds. At one end of camp, children can take classes and play games while at far other end, a cavernous tent held up by PVC pipe hosts late-night live stripper shows.  ""One of the big things about the libertarian movement is self-responsibility,"" said PorcFest attendee Denise Hoitt.

Strict rules on how much money people and businesses can access, issued last week, mean most companies aren't able to make payments with Greek bank accounts and credit cards outside the country.   That's a problem for tech startups, many of which have online expenses they can't pay -- not because they can't afford them but because they're not allowed to transfer money abroad. This creates an existential crisis. For example, there are recurring hosting fees to keep their websites -- their livelihoods -- up and running.   ""You feel like a hostage,"" said Greek entrepreneur Panos Papadopoulos.   Papadopoulos is an entrepreneur and angel investor who uprooted himself nearly two years ago from Athens to San Francisco. His startup BugSense was acquired in 2013 by Splunk (SPLK) where he works today.   He remains connected to the Greek startup ecosystem -- not only as an investor but through a volunteer effort called ZeroFund.   ZeroFund is a no-strings attached funding vehicle. Its goal is to prevent Greek startups from folding by donating small amounts of money.   Through ZeroFund's site, companies in need can fill out a form with information about their company: What is the biggest issue you're facing? How many employees do you have? How much a month do you need?   ZeroFund provides the donation through pre-paid Visas and MasterCards.   ""We don't take any stake in the companies. It's a favor,"" said Papadopoulos, who added that it feels good to give back to his country.   The group has received applications from 78 Greek companies, ranging from e-learning startups to tourism websites. ZeroFund has helped roughly 30 entrepreneurs so far.   The cumulative amount it has gifted is just $1,900 so far.   Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen tweeted his support and pledged to contribute with a pre-paid card.   Two recent ZeroFund requests:   --""All my Greek credit cards are declined, even for the small amount I need to pay (12,99 dollars). I requested time from my hosting company and they gave me 2 deadlines with the last one for tomorrow. As you can understand I am very anxious about tomorrow as my clients websites cannot be offline even for minutes.""   --""We currently host around 150 websites on 3 designated servers with Hetzner (Germany). The billing is done on a monthly basis with an automated credit card payment. This will be rejected on the 12th of July with the current credit control situation. We are stuffed. If you could help us out, that would be greatly appreciated.""   ZeroFund will only pay for business essentials, not things like advertising campaigns. Joining Papadopoulos in this effort are five others: BugSense co-founder Jon Vlachogiannis; Greek-German entrepreneur Wassilios Kazakos; General Catalyst's Niko Bonatsos; Kickstarter's John Dimatos; and Zoottle's Christos Perakis.   Though ZeroFund hasn't donated much to date, they're expecting the need will only grow.   ""Just a small amount for the time being but it keeps them afloat,"" said Papadopoulos. ""We're trying to prepare for a much bigger influx of requests over the next couple of weeks."" "

The move was prompted by a campaign waged by Sheriff Tom Dart, of Cook County, Illinois. Dart sent letters to both companies alleging that the classified ad website is used for sex trafficking and prostitution. He estimates Backpage.com generates over $100 million in revenue annually from adult advertising.   ""It has become increasingly indefensible for any corporation to willfully play a central role in an industry that reaps its cash from the victimization of women and girls across the world,"" he wrote.   Related: Silicon Valley's other entrepreneurs: Sex workers   Dart said his department has made over 800 arrests related to the site, including more than 50 sex-trafficking and prostitution busts and a juvenile sex trafficking arrest last month.   Dart also sued Craigslist in 2009 for advertising similar services, and that website later shut down its adult section. Dart told CNNMoney that he wants to show the public how ""horrific"" prostitution and sex-trafficking are.   ""We cannot turn a blind on this and pretend this is some twisted 'Pretty Woman' situation,"" Dart said.   Representatives for the Dallas-based Backpage.com had no comment.   ""MasterCard has rules that prohibit our cards from being used for illegal or brand-damaging activities,"" said spokesman Seth Eisen.   Visa's statement said that the company ""has a long history of working with law enforcement to safeguard the integrity of the payment system, and we will continue to do so.""   Earlier this year, American Express (AXP) announced that it stopped doing business with Backpage.   According to Dart's office, Bitcoin is now the only currency that can be used on Backpage.com. "

Greece became the first developed country to default to the IMF, an organization of 188 nations that tries to keep the world economy stable.   Greece will now be cut off from access to IMF resources until the payment is made.   The move came hours after the country made a desperate attempt Tuesday to halt its plunge into economic chaos by requesting a new European bailout.   Greece asked for a two-year bailout from Europe, its third in six years. The bankrupt country is reported to be asking for 29 billion euros ($32 billion).   Finance ministers discussed the request by phone and agreed to hold another call Wednesday, when Greece is expected to provide more details.   Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chaired the meeting, said any new rescue may require tougher conditions than those Greece has already rejected because of the rapid deterioration in the country's finances.   ""So this is not an easy road to go down,"" he told CNN's Richard Quest.   Greece is fast running out of money. It rejected the conditions Europe and the IMF set for releasing the remaining billions from its existing bailout at the weekend. That bailout expired Tuesday.   ""The last chance to get a solid extension of the old program has gone by,"" Dijsselbloem said. ""We are now in a difficult situation.""   Greece is now on its own financially, and can't pay all its bills.   Related: The very big risks of the Greek debt crisis   Any third bailout from Europe would take time to negotiate. And without a huge shift in the Greek government's position, a new round of talks may prove just as fruitless as the last.   That's because Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is still urging Greeks to vote against the most recent bailout offer from Europe and the IMF in a referendum on Sunday.   ""That seems to be a very difficult base to have serious and constructive talks upon,"" Dijsselbloem said.   European leaders have said that a ""No"" vote would set Greece on a path out of the eurozone. ""Yes"" could smooth the way for new negotiations.   Analysts said Tsipras would have to perform a dramatic U-turn, accepting very similar strings to those attached to previous offers.   ""In short, he would have to change his behavior radically from how he behaved so far,"" noted Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. ""A huge hurdle for him to jump over.""   Greek banks remained shut Tuesday and limits on cash withdrawals were in place as the country tried to stave off financial collapse before the vote.   Daily withdrawals are limited to 60 euros, or about $67.   The country's banks have been bleeding billions of euros for months, even before the country's debt crisis took a dramatic turn for the worse this weekend, leading to long lines at ATMs in Athens.

Ten times as many Greeks are registering to trade bitcoins on the German marketplace Bitcoin.de than usual, according to CEO Oliver Flaskaemper. Bitcoin trades from Greece have shot up 79% from their ten-week average on Bitstamp, the world's third-largest exchange.   Even trading platforms in China are getting interest. LakeBTC, headquartered in Shanghai, is seeing a 40% increase in visitors using computers in Greece.   Over the weekend, the Polish exchange Bitcurex got flooded with emails from Greeks. Among their questions:      Bitcurex then started marketing directly to Greeks on its website: ""Sign up at Bitcurex and trade for 3 months for free. No Fees for Greece!""   Related: What is Bitcoin?   For those wondering, yes, bitcoins can be spent legally in Europe. And yes, a digital Bitcoin wallet can be used as a sort of access-from-anywhere bank account.   The simplest way to understand Bitcoin is to think of it as electronic cash. You can spend it using any smartphone or computer.   But that's not the hard part.   First, it's incredibly difficult to obtain bitcoins. There's a single Bitcoin ATM in all of Greece -- at a bookstore in Athens. And the most common method -- buying them in an online marketplace -- requires sending a wire transfer from a bank. But banks in Greece are closed.   It's not impossible, though. The exchange Bitcoin.de said some Greeks are managing to get bitcoins, because they still get access to online banking. Meanwhile, LakeBTC said Greeks can try to find local ""LakeBankers"" who are willing to sell some of their Bitcoin stash using paper cash or PayPal.   The second challenge? There aren't many ways to spend them in Greece anyway. According to one publicly maintained registry, BitcoinMaps, there are only half a dozen spots in Athens that accept Bitcoin as payment. Among them: a family restaurant called Angel Tavern, a head-and-neck surgeon, and a yacht rental company.   As CNNMoney documented last year, it's difficult to live entirely on Bitcoin -- even in high tech, modern New York City.   Share your story: Are you Greek? Now interested in Bitcoin?   Still, this is a pivotal moment. Bitcoin was created as an independent, computerized money in 2009 to provide a stark alternative to government-issued currency held at banks. This could be its moment to shine.   But keep your wits about you. Filip Godecki, the spokesman for the Bitcurex marketplace, said it's unrealistic to think Greeks everywhere will suddenly ditch the Euro and start conducting business in Bitcoin.   ""I'm not so sure Greeks will start buying cheese with Bitcoin on Wednesday,"" he said. ""But I think something changed in their minds [with the bank closures]. Greek people will start thinking about fiat currencies as something not so safe for savings.""   The biggest downside for Bitcoin is that it's extremely volatile. In November 2012, a bitcoin was worth $11. That skyrocketed to $1,100 a year later. On Monday, a bitcoin was trading at $253.   But that shaky price shouldn't keep Greeks away, Godecki said. Or worries that this electronic currency isn't real money.   ""You can't be cut off from Bitcoin,"" he said. ""It can be much more real than the inaccessible money in the bank.""

Additionally, Amin taught followers how to use bitcoin to covertly send funds to the terror group. How ISIS is luring so many Americans to join its ranks Social media has been widely utilized by the terror organization for recruiting and propaganda purposes, but the U.S. has also used the various mediums, like Twitter, to hone in on foreign targets.  ""Around the nation, we are seeing ISIL use social media to reach out from the other side of the world,"" Assistant Attorney General Carlin said. ""Their messages are reaching America in an attempt to radicalize, recruit and incite our youth and others to support ISIL's violent causes.""

Investigators spent more than a month watching the teen before he was arrested, the Washington Post reported at the time citing officials and neighbors.  ""Today's guilty plea demonstrates that those who use social media as a tool to provide support and resources to ISIL will be identified and prosecuted with no less vigilance than those who travel to take up arms with ISIL,"" said U.S. Attorney Dana J.

""You, as the defendant, have to pay the price.""   She said anyone considering following in Ulbricht's footsteps needs ""to understand there will be very serious consequences.""   Rejecting Ulbricht's request for mercy during the nearly three-hour hearing in Manhattan federal court, Forrest said of Silk Road, ""It was carefully planned life's work. It was your opus. You wanted it to be your legacy and it is.""   The judge also addressed the 97 letters that had been written to the court by Ulbricht's family and supporters seeking leniency.   Forrest acknowledged that Ulbricht didn't fit the profile of a typical criminal, but said she had no interest in making a judgment ""on which of you to know"" -- the Ulbricht portrayed in the letters or the convicted criminal standing before her.   The judge also said there was ""no doubt"" that Ulbricht paid for murders of those who had threatened Silk Road. Prosecutors had charged Ulbricht with commissioning six murders-for-hire but those charges were dropped and there is no evidence that these murders were ever carried out.   Forrest ordered Ulbricht to forfeit $183 million.   Earlier in court, Ulbricht made an emotional appeal to Forrest for leniency, insisting he wasn't a greedy person and asking for a second chance.   ""I wish I could go back and convince myself to take a different path,"" he said. ""I've ruined my life.""     Ulbricht, a college grad from Penn State, explained that he created Silk Road to empower people by providing them with ""privacy"" and ""anonymity.""

Numerous laws and regulations are now in place in an effort to curb the worst of Wall Street's excesses.   But Wall Street has pushed back on the laws.

One of the biggest changes since the financial crisis is the introduction of the whisteblower program. The Securities and Exchange Commission started it to encourage more reporting of wrongdoing.   Whisteblowers can get millions of dollars in rewards. But the survey found that 37% of respondents don't even know the program exists.   But banks have introduced tighter confidentiality measures and even gag orders to bar employees from discussing anything beyond bank walls. About a quarter of top bankers have been asked to sign agreements that would prevent them from reporting illegal or unethical activities to regulators.   ""Without an aggressive plan to stamp out misconduct, we are simply sitting and waiting for another financial disaster to strike,"" the report warns. "
430,430,People in Germany are going crazy for gold,http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/14/investing/gold-germany-europe-ecb/index.html,"May 14, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," It may be a sign they are worried about the future. People tend to buy gold when they fear economic disaster or a spike in prices.   The World Gold Council report released on Thursday said demand for total gold bar and coins spiked by 20% in Germany during the first quarter from the year before.   It's unusual for gold to be a hot commodity in an economy as strong Germany's is right now. And growth in Europe has regained momentum in recent months, outpacing even the sluggish pace experienced in the U.S.   Here is what's driving the European gold rush:   Inflation fears: The sale of gold has surged as the European Central Bank embarked on an experiment aimed at purchasing at least $1.3 trillion of bonds.   Some German citizens appear to be worried about a spike in prices triggered by so-called central bank money printing.   ""You're talking about a group of people who have been burned before by governments overprinting currency. They've been through hyperinflation back in the 1920s,"" said Van Simmons, a buyer and seller of gold coins who is president of David Hall Rare Coins.   Simmons was referring to the psychological scars inflicted by the epic hyperinflation experienced by Germany in the Weimar Republic. Many gold bugs still point to that experience to justify buying gold today.   Related: Europe: There's plenty of good news. And then there's Greece   Greek jitters persist: Germans aren't the only ones in Europe stepping up their purchases of gold. Demand also increased by at least double-digits in France, Switzerland and Austria during the first quarter.   The World Gold Council said the first three months of 2015 represented the strongest start to a year for European gold demand since 2011 -- the year of the sovereign debt crisis that threatened to tear the eurozone apart.   Not only are people in Europe expressing concern about the ECB's stimulus programs backfiring, but they also seem to be fretting about the never-ending Greek crisis and lingering tensions with Russia over Ukraine.   Gold still sluggish: Yet the enthusiasm for the yellow metal wasn't shared by the rest of the world. Global demand for gold bars and coins actually declined by 10% during the first quarter. American demand shrank by 12% as the Fed positioned itself to raise interest rates, though that may now be postponed by the economic slowdown.   Gold prices have also been relatively tame. Gold is up 3.5% so far this year to $1,225 a troy ounce. With inflation remaining tame around the world, gold is well off its all-time high of nearly $1,900 experienced in 2011.   Gold bulls believe that will change -- eventually.   ""It is only a matter of when, not if, the bull market resumes in light of the major instability that is being created by reckless global monetary policy, trillions of negative yielding paper and fiat currencies that continue to get abused,"" Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.

431,431,Robots threaten these 8 jobs,http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/13/news/economy/robots-threaten-jobs-unemployment/index.html,"May 13, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Economists are sharply divided over the exact timing of the threat from robots and other forms of futuristic technology. Some see an imminent threat, others believe it won't happen until later this century -- if at all.   Yet Amy Webb, a digital media futurist and founder of Webbmedia Group, predicts at least eight career fields are ""ripe for disruption"" very soon -- like in the next 10 to 20 years.   ""You should be quite worried,"" Webb said at the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles last month. She points to these eight careers, in particular:   1) Toll booth operators and cashiers: People who work in the transactional space shouldn't be big fans of the Apple Watch or Apple Pay.   That's because the rise of wearable technology and mobile payment systems may make jobs like toll booth operator and grocery store cashier virtually obsolete.   ""There is no real need for a person to be there every step of the way,"" Webb said.   2) Marketers: Powerful advertising tools of the future may allow brands to fashion their messages to customers with precision accuracy.   Webb pointed to new experiments with technologies that study customer behavior to identify what kind of ads will be most effective.   ""This is pretty much unlike anything we've seen before,"" she said.   If these tools work, they may translate to smaller creative and strategic teams at marketing and ad firms.   Related: Will this one-armed robot take your job?   3) Customer service: Many customer service jobs have been shipped overseas to India and other lower-paying countries. New technologies like predictive analytics could kill off more of these jobs.   Look no further than Watson, the friendly IBM (IBM) supercomputer that won millions of fans by defeating former Jeopardy champions.   Webb warns that one of the things Watson can do, though it's not positioned that way right now, is to replace everybody in the customer service department of a company.   4) Factory workers: Get ready for robots to steal more manufacturing jobs from humans -- at a cheaper price and without taking breaks to text their friends.   The next wave of disruption is likely to be led by haptics, a sensor-based technology that allows people to virtually feel what they are working on even when the actual task is taking place far away.   5) Financial middle men: Don't knock Bitcoin -- Its underlying technology may steal your job.   Blockchain, Bitcoin's computer program, is able to automatically process transactions and create a perfect, reliable digital record.   Webb believes blockchain will disrupt the middle men in the banking, escrow, insurance and mortgage sectors.   ""Whether or not Bitcoin ever takes off is beside the point. It's the underlying infrastructure that will dramatically change the work that's being done,"" Webb said.   We may have received a sneak preview of that this week when Nasdaq (NDAQ) said it will use blockchain to keep transaction records in its pre-IPO market.   Related: Peter Thiel: Robots don't threaten middle-class jobs   6) Journalists: The Internet wiped out countless newspapers, and new technology could kill even more journalism positions.   Webb, a former journalist at Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, said the next culprit will be algorithms that allow news outlets to automatically create stories and place them on websites without human interaction. Robot journalists (fedora optional) are already writing thousands of articles a quarter at The Associated Press.   7) Lawyers: If you're going into the legal world, veer toward litigation.   Webb believes non-litigation lawyers could soon be replaced by online form-based services like LegalZoom that can carry out simple tasks like trademark applications, wills and even divorce.   It's all been made easier by the trend to make records more open and easily accessible, lessening the need for high-priced lawyers.   Related: Where do Millennials want to work? Not at corporations   8) Phone workers: Many millennials don't have landline phones. That trend is only likely to continue with the advances of digital communication.   That means telecom companies like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) could eliminate billing, operator and other positions on the telephone side of the business.   ""There are a bunch of jobs that don't really need to exist,"" Webb said.   Fearing the future? These predictions will make people who work in these fields understandably cringe. But Webb isn't pessimistic about what lies ahead.   ""I don't see our technological future as a dystopian one. I just see it as different. For many people different is dystopian, which is something you need to get over,"" she said.   One outcome may be that tomorrow's employers will value very different skillsets than today's.   ""We need highly-skilled plumbers and highly-skilled people in all types of fields we no longer venerate,"" Webb said. "
432,432,Nasdaq will start using Bitcoin technology,http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/11/technology/nasdaq-bitcoin-technology/index.html,"May 11, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Most people have heard of Bitcoin (XBT) as a system of electronic money -- one that hasn't really caught on yet.   But what gets less attention is blockchain, the technology that powers the Bitcoin system. It's a computer program that automatically processes transactions and creates a perfect, reliable digital record.   High-tech bankers are starting to realize this could revolutionize trading. Nasdaq (NDAQ), a favorite exchange among many technology companies, is making the first move.   On Monday, the stock market announced it will start using a blockchain system to keep records for its Nasdaq Private Market, which handles trading of shares in the pre-IPO phase before a company goes public.   Nasdaq sees the blockchain's perfect recordkeeping as a major step in the right direction for more transparency. The pre-IPO market doesn't typically see as much trading and what does occur is often by a tight circle of employees and early investors.   ""Blockchain technology will provide extensive integrity, audit ability, governance and transfer of ownership capabilities,"" Nasdaq said in its public announcement.   This doesn't mean Nasdaq is using actual Bitcoins as currency. But Nasdaq will be interacting with the Bitcoin system to slip data into the blockchain.   By using Bitcoin's core technology, this is a major acknowledgment of Bitcoin's contribution to finance and trade. This is the first time the world has seen a trading system that doesn't require a trusted middleman. It sounds boring, but in the banking world, it's revolutionary.   CNN explains: What is Bitcoin?    It seems odd to equate Bitcoin with better security. The world's first true big digital currency is generally known for two things. One, its popularity in online black markets. Two, the epic fall of Mt. Gox, a major Bitcoin exchange market that wiped out $400 million in people's savings.   But these have nothing to do with the digital currency itself. Bitcoin's perfect recordkeeping actually helped convict a black market kingpin. And computer security experts say Bitcoin's technology actually makes it more secure than any other money transfer system.   Nasdaq's experiment is a limited one. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal referred to Nasdaq's pre-IPO market, which launched in January 2014, as ""a fledgling marketplace."" But if it works out, expect to see it use the blockchain concept elsewhere.   ""Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,"" Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said in a statement.

433,433,Google Maps shuts down editing after 'robot peeing' incident,http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/11/technology/google-maps-android-peeing/index.html,"May 11, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Starting on Tuesday, Google is suspending its public Map Maker tool -- preventing its community of users from independently adding landmarks and helpful tips to Google Maps.   The reason? There are too many pranksters out there.   Until recently, a loyal community amateur cartographers routinely edited Google Maps with little oversight. But after someone created a fake park in Pakistan -- in the shape of an Android robot peeing on an Apple logo -- Google imposed a strict review process.   The company started to manually review every submission. But Google (GOOGL) now says it can't handle the deluge of work coming in. Pavithra Kanakarajan, a member of the company's Google Maps team, explained the situation in a blog post Friday.   ""Every edit you make is essentially going to a backlog that is growing very fast,"" she said. ""It is not fair to any of our users to let them continue to spend time editing.""   Kanakarajan said ""the most recent incident"" -- likely the peeing Android robot -- came from ""a strong user in our community."" That explains why no one noticed the image sooner.   In the old system, Google mappers edited fellow mappers. Prolific contributors gained enough trust that their submissions were no longer subject to public review before going live.   And these map edits were most likely in rural areas. After all, Google created Map Maker in 2011 to improve the accuracy of its popular tool. Locals know if a highway is a one-way road, or if there's a small lake. That's especially true in rural regions that don't get analyzed often by satellites in space.   That peeing Android robot was created as a fake park in the outskirts of Rawalpindi, a Pakistani city less than 10 miles southwest of Islamabad.   And it looks like this wasn't the only incident. In her note, Kanakarajan said ""we have been experiencing escalated attacks to spam Google Maps over the past few months.""   A Google spokesperson said some users have been creating ""all kinds of map pranks,"" such as fake highway exits.   But Google isn't saying who this mysterious map editor was -- or when the map editing tool might come back.  This is a modal window.   "

But Sam Altman, president of elite Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator, says he doesn't subscribe to this belief.   In a blog post, Altman acknowledges that yes, there have been some unreasonable early-stage valuations, but those are insignificant compared to the larger market.   ""It's a small amount of capital and still nothing I would call a 'bubble,'"" he wrote. He admits that he's ""pretty paranoid"" about bubbles -- yet he feels very hopeful about the future of tech.

435,435,Liberland: Could the world's newest micronation get off the ground?,http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/25/europe/liberland-worlds-newest-micronation/index.html,"Apr 25, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)It would have made Thomas Jefferson proud.  Established on the birthday of the American founding father, Liberland -- the world's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers-that-be.  A tiny, 7 square-kilometer parcel of land, marked on maps as Gornja Siga, its territory abuts the Danube on the border between Serbia and Croatia. The victim of a border dispute between Serbia and Croatia, it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no-man's land.  No one lives on this patch of land, which is heavily forested and contains only badly-maintained access roads and a run-down house, abandoned for decades. This is where Euroskeptic Czech politician Vit Jedlicka stepped in.  On April 13 he planted his newly-designed yellow and black flag in the territory, declaring the area the Free Republic of Liberland -- a tiny sliver of a country, bigger only than the Vatican and Monaco. He tells CNN that the country will be formally founded on May 1 and is inviting, through the media, the world's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation's birth.  He says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of Liberland to the ceremony, where he will grant them citizenship.  ""I will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party,"" he told CNN by phone. ""It's short notice but a good challenge, and also for  the presidents (and other heads of state) if they can make it to the founding of our country."" Jedlicka, an active member of the Czech Republic's Party of Free Citizens, opposes excessive government interference.  He says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is Liberland.  ""I would describe it as a global revolution. It's just the beginning,"" he tells CNN via Skype. Founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is ""To live and let live"" -- its website describes its system of governance as being a ""constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy."" It will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to Bitcoin -- as its national currency, bypassing the need for a central bank and will, according to its constitution, keep government's noses out of everything possible, from the banks to prostitution.  ""Liberland prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation,"" the world's newest constitutional document states. Financial regulation will be minimal, if at all present.  Jedlicka says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received, about 20 of which have been accepted. ""Thousands of Americans, Swiss people. Also a lot of Arabic peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there.""  He envisions, ultimately, a community of around 35,000 Liberlanders, not all of whom will be full-time residents.  He says he expects trouble from his neighbors, whose land he has effectively annexed. ""From Serbia, Croatia, we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation, and we will offer nothing but passive resistance. For now, (though) we will make roads, docks."" For its part, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement to CNN that stated that Liberland would not theoretically impinge upon its border, which is delineated by the Danube, but ""the Ministry also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment."" Croatia's counterpart was similarly dismissive. ""Virtual quips, however interesting they occasionally sound, remain what they are -- virtual quips, and for them we have no official comment."" "
436,436,This man bet $100K that there's a startup bubble,http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/30/technology/sam-altman-tech-startup-bubble-bet/index.html,"Mar 30, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Many in the industry have been sounding warning bells about a possible bubble, citing early-stage startups attracting millions in investment at sky-high valuations, despite having little or no revenue.   Last week, tech investor Sam Altman challenged bubble believers to put money where their mouths are.   Altman, who invests in young tech companies through Y Combinator, said that though there are some unreasonable valuations, he's hopeful about the future of tech. He made three predictions on where specific tech startups will be in five years' time and encouraged someone to bet against him. The wager: $100,000 in a charitable donation.   Now, Boston-based venture capitalist Michael de la Maza has taken up the challenge. For De la Maza to win, Altman has to be wrong on one of the following statements:      Interestingly, de la Maza -- who runs a $500,000 fund -- doesn't have strong beliefs on whether we are, or are not, in the midst of a tech bubble.   ""People call it a bubble whenever valuations are 50% higher than they were a year ago. I think that is very uninteresting,"" he said. ""[It is] a very information light conversation.""   De la Maza said he took the bet because he wanted the opportunity to work with the startup guru -- and he believes in Altman's mission.   ""I'm relatively indifferent to what the bet itself is,"" de la Maza said. ""I think what [Altman] was trying to do was turn [the bubble] into a hypothesis that can be tracked -- to make it very clear, and allow people to concretely talk about.""   Altman confirmed the bet on Sunday via Twitter. He also opened up the bet to another investor with a larger portfolio.   Danielle Morrill, CEO of Y Combinator-backed Mattermark, will track the startup portfolios in question using her firm's business intelligence software.   De la Maza , who used to play chess and poker, said he's prepared to donate to charity should he lose the bet.   He's even eying a Y Combinator-backed nonprofit as a potential recipient: Watsi, a crowd-sourced healthcare platform.   ""I think it's a wonderful thing that a charity is going to receive $100,000,"" he said. "

Now, campaign messages are launching faster, earlier, and more frequently thanks to social media.   So far, four politicians have announced they are officially seeking a place in the White House in 2016, and each has been hard at work coming up with different ways to drum up support, especially on Facebook (FB).   CNNMoney worked with Facebook and social media analytics firm Socialbakers to figure out which contenders elicited the most chatter around their announcement -- and from whom.   We also took a look at each campaign's Facebook page to see how they have been managed to date.   Here's how each campaign stacks up.   Engagement on Facebook pages. Rand Paul has the most number of likes on his Facebook page compared to his competition. The Kentucky Senator has more than 1.9 million fans on Facebook. Ted Cruz comes in second with 1.2 million, and Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton are in third and fourth place with about 826,000 and 770,00 likes, respectively.   Clinton didn't launch her Facebook page until the day she announced, so it's not fair to say one candidate is winning on Facebook based on page likes alone.   More telling is the number of interactions on each page. According to Socialbakers, Paul had the highest number of interactions on his page within the first day of his announcement (191,823), while Cruz came in second with 162,010, and Clinton and Rubio each received 149,824 and 101,016 on their pages, respectively.   Engagement on Facebook overall. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, though. People don't just talk about candidates on the campaign pages -- millions of people talked about them on their own News Feeds and timelines as well.   By that measure, Clinton's announcement generated by far the most chatter on Facebook.   Within the first 24 hours of her official bid, about 11 million posts, and likes, comments and shares of those posts, took place around the news. On the second day, interactions were still high -- and peaked at over 5.7 million.   Only Cruz came close to matching this level of noise when he told the country he was running. His name generated 5.6 million posts and interactions on the first day and 3 million the second day.     Look who's talking. According to Facebook, young women 18 to 24 posted, liked and clicked twice as much about Clinton as they did about Cruz, Paul, and Rubio. Men aged 65 and over, on the other hand, were far more interested in the other three candidates than they were about Hillary.   About 62% of posts related to Clinton were made by women during the first 24 hours of her campaign launch. Rubio also attracted more women than men: 54% of posts and interactions about him were created by women.   The majority of interactions on content about Cruz and Paul came from men, at 53% and 58% respectively.   Ted Cruz. Since confirming his run for the White House a month ago, Senator Cruz has posted to his official Facebook page over 50 times.   The most popular piece of content, in terms of number of likes, was a link to his website announcing his support for Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after he signed a controversial religious freedom bill.   ""Indiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties,"" his statement reads. On Facebook, the post has generated almost 52,000 likes to date.   Related: The Ted Cruz economy -- Reality-checking his talking points   Rand Paul.

When Clinton made a big splash in the news by ordering at Chipotle, Paul responded with a picture of himself in front one of the restaurants. ""I heard Chipotle is a great place for lunch these days..."" the caption reads. The photo got over 45,000 likes and 1,700 shares.

There's also a few bumper sticker giveaways and even an animated GIF on National High Five Day, April 16, which received 5,400 likes.   Related: Why everybody's talking about Hillary Clinton's new logo   Marco Rubio.

Most of the posts are links back to his official website and campaign video speeches or interviews. A handful of posts link back to Rubio answering the most popular questions about him that people are searching on Google (GOOGL), including ""Is Marco Rubio a conservative?"" (Answer: Yes!) "

According to the site, she's being blackmailed. ""This white girl is blackmailed to take off her clothes on webcam,"" a caption reads. ""She refuses in the beginning but after a while, she has no choice.""   The website runs similar videos of several other women. It's hard to trace the location of the website -- it's only accessible on the dark web, an unregulated corner of the Internet where people can buy everything from drugs to hacking tools. Payments are made using bitcoin.   Hackers are breaking into webcams and emails and social networks to gain access to intimate images. They then threaten to make the images public, and share them with the victim's friends and family, if she does not comply.   A federal law enforcement official who asked not to be named said these sites mostly target younger women.   ""They know they're easy to extort,"" he told CNNMoney. ""[They] catch them in a provocative photo and say they're going to send this to all your friends if you don't do x, y, z.""   This type of harassment was virtually unknown until it happened to Miss Teen USA, Cassidy Wolf, in 2013.   Wolf, along with more than a hundred other women, had their webcams hacked and private moments recorded. The culprit was a 19-year-old computer science student who demanded the women send more nude photos or perform for him via webcam. He threatened to post the photos if the women didn't comply.   There are plenty of sites on the open web devoted to revenge porn -- often times a bitter ex will post private photos after a breakup. But dig a little deeper, and it gets even worse.   ""They're forced or exploited into doing horrible things to themselves while being videotaped,"" security researcher Chris Hadnagy told CNNMoney.   According to Hadnagy, there are now growing markets for this type of content.   Hadnagy says it costs just a few dollars to buy malware, disguise it, and target a victim via email. If a victim clicks on the attachment, it gives the hacker remote access to the computer. The hacker would then be able to turn on a webcam and record.   On the dark web, sites advertise ""rent-a-hacker"" services, featuring hackers willing to carry out any type of attack. One particular ad boasts, ""I'll do anything for money...if you want me to destroy someone's business or personal life, I'll do it."" The prices range from 200 to 500 euros, depending on the type of hacking job. There's even 24/7 hour customer support.   Hadnagy says the stolen nudes are traded like baseball cards on the dark web.   On one site, users are offered a pack of nudes, which contains 810 videos for 0.21 bitcoin, or $55. Users can also receive them for free by uploading their own ""revenge blackmail"" videos.   The federal law official said his agency has worked on some of these cases but that the dark web is a difficult nut to crack.   His advice: Think twice before opening unfamiliar emails.

439,439,Man who claims to own 50% of Facebook can't revive lawsuit,http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/21/technology/paul-ceglia-facebook-lawsuit/index.html,"Apr 21, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," A federal appeals court called the 41-year old Ceglia's attempt to revive his years-old case against Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook (FB) ""meritless.""   The bizarre Ceglia-Facebook legal saga began in 2010, when Ceglia filed suit in New York claiming that he paid Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to build a website similar to what became Facebook, and that they agreed to split the company 50-50.   Ceglia claimed to have possession of a ""Work for Hire"" agreement, dated April 2003, in which Ceglia arranged to pay Zuckerberg for development work on a now-defunct site called StreetFax. Ceglia claimed the deal also covered work on a fledgling site called ""the Face Book"" and produced a contract to back his claim.   A court ruled that Ceglia had forged those documents, and the case was thrown out. The real contract, discovered on one of Ceglia's hard drives, did not include anything related to Facebook, prosecutors argued.   In 2012, Ceglia was arrested after a federal jury indicted him on two fraud charges: one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The trial was set to begin May 4. Zuckerberg had been scheduled to testify against him.     But Ceglia snapped off his ankle bracelet last month and disappeared. His whereabouts, along with that of his wife and two children, are currently unknown. Prosecutors say Ceglia rigged up a contraption that simulated movements and attached the electronic ankle bracelet to it in order to remain undetected.   Despite his fugitive status and mountains of evidence against him, Ceglia sought to revive his cases against Zuckerberg and Facebook.   On Monday, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York court issued a scathing ruling, calling Ceglia, ""an individual who has repeatedly demonstrated total disregard for our judicial system."" Even dismissing the fact that he has attempted to escape justice, the court said it would uphold the lower court's ruling.   The appeals court agreed with the lower court that Ceglia clearly doctored the Work for Hire contract, noting that ""overwhelming forensic evidence demonstrates ... discrepancies in the age of the ink, the font, formatting, the printing toner, the paper and the handwriting.""   ""Indeed, many of the suspicious irregularities cited by the experts are apparent to the naked, untrained eye,"" the appeals court noted.   It also said Ceglia's claim that he didn't remember that he had owned 50% of Facebook ""belies common sense."" When asked why he waited to bring the case to light until 2010, seven years after Facebook was founded, Ceglia said he had forgotten.   Ceglia's lawsuit just happened to coincide with the release of the movie ""The Social Network,"" which the court of appeals called ""convenient.""   Facebook applauded the court's ruling.   ""From Day One, we've said that this case is a fraud and after reviewing the evidence, the Court of Appeals agreed,"" Facebook spokeswoman Vanessa Chan said. ""We are pleased that the truth has prevailed.""   Despite the frivolous nature of the lawsuit, it has haunted Facebook for years. When Ceglia initially filed his charges in mid-2010, a state court in New York's Allegany County briefly froze the company's assets, while Facebook's lawyers scrambled to untangle Ceglia's claims and Zuckerberg's pre-Facebook business dealings.   Since then, Ceglia's lies have become transparent, and he has gone through legal teams like toilet paper.   Prior to the Facebook lawsuit, Ceglia has had several brushes with the law, including a 1997 felony conviction for possession of 400 grams of a compound found in certain hallucinogenic mushrooms. In 2009, Ceglia was convicted of fraud in connection with a wood pellet company he owned. "
440,440,Would you wear a tracker to get an insurance discount?,http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/08/technology/security/insurance-data-tracking/index.html,"Apr 8, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," It was only a matter of time.   It's increasingly popular to wear a fitness tracker that measures your footsteps, heart rate or body movements. Now, the life insurance company John Hancock is offering deal if you'll wear one: 15% off in some cases.   The company unveiled its optional, new program Wednesday morning. John Hancock is partnering with Vitality, which many people probably know as one of those work-related wellness programs. The program is available in 30 states.   If you sign up for this, John Hancock will send you a free Fitbit monitor. That's a tiny, pill-shaped device that some people wear in sleek-looking bracelets to track how far they walk/run, the calories burned, and the quality of sleep.   That means the insurance company would know exactly when a customer does a sit-up, how far she runs -- or when she's skipped the gym for a few days.   The program works like other ""customer rewards"" programs at restaurants and retailers. Your actions earn points that place you in one of three levels -- silver, gold or platinum.   The healthier your lifestyle, the higher you go, and the steeper the discount. And it changes as your health data gets analyzed.   Points can also qualify customers for discounts at Hyatt (H) hotels, Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruises, Whole Foods (WFM) grocery stores, and REI outdoor gear stores.   ""We're introducing a whole new approach for life insurance that rewards and recognizes people for healthy living,"" said Mike Doughty, John Hancock's president, at a presentation in New York City on Wednesday.   First, the upside: That 15% discount might amount to about $91 a year. Life insurance is generally much cheaper than health insurance, and this program could make it even less expensive.   But it's not much of a reward for wearing a leash all year.   That's based on data from independent insurance agents at Trusted Choice. Industrywide, the average cost of a $500,000 term life insurance policy for a 65-year-old, non-smoking man is $611. It's slightly cheaper for women of the same age, so the savings are smaller.   At Wednesday's event, Vitality marketing executive Tal Gilbert said people are hard-wired for short-term rewards, rather than things that have a longer term impact.   ""The idea is to give you much more immediate payoff,"" Gilbert said.   It's the insurance industry's way of trying to incentivize people into buying life insurance.   But there are immediate privacy implications.   First, the pendulum swings both ways. If you don't exercise that tracker will rat you out -- and you'll lose the discount. Trackers are simply a way for insurance companies to more accurately judge you. And as they get more accurate (measuring cholesterol, blood sugar levels), so will the judgment.   Second, that personal data -- your heart rate, preferred exercises, what gym you visit and when -- ends up on insurance company computers. And these databases are a target for hackers, who steal this information and sell it on the black market to identity thieves and fraudsters.   This past winter, insurance giant Anthem was hit by massive data breach when hackers snuck into its computers. Shortly after that, the large American insurer Premera revealed that hackers broke into its computer systems too -- and that of Vivacity, a work wellness partner.   John Hancock marketing executive Brooks Tingle told CNNMoney the company and Vitality would not sell or share health data to any other entity. He also said it would live encrypted on company computers inside the United States.  This is a modal window.   "
441,441,Election 2016: Who's the pastor who introduced Rand Paul?,http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/07/politics/paul-rand-pastor-jerry-stephenson/index.html,"Apr 8, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN)By the time Sen. Rand Paul took the stage Tuesday at his presidential announcement rally, he was the first white man to address the audience at the event. Prior to his speech, a diverse group of speakers took turns introducing the Kentucky Republican. One of those was Jerry Stephenson of Louisville, an African-American pastor who thunderously endorsed Paul in part because of the senator's outreach to people who don't traditionally vote for the GOP. Stephenson, firing up the crowd, praised the senator for traveling to Democratic strongholds such as inner-city Detroit and Chicago, where Paul promoted policies that favor school choice and ideas to reform the criminal justice system. READ: Rand Paul: 'I'm putting myself forward as a candidate for president' ""He goes everywhere,"" Stephenson cheered. ""It doesn't matter what color you are, Rand Paul will be there."" Stephenson's appearance made for good optics for Paul's campaign rollout, though he quickly found himself getting negative attention for raising questions about President Barack Obama's religion.  So who is this pastor from Louisville? Stephenson, 66, has been the senior minister at Midwest Church of Christ since 1985 and pastor since 1997. He gained big applause when he proclaimed Tuesday that he was previously a lifelong Democrat who became an independent in 2012: ""I am telling every independent it's time for you to run out here and run with Sen. Rand Paul."" Paul has received a lot of press coverage for trying to court African-American voters, part of his strategy to broaden the GOP base and be seen as viable in a general election. He was one of the few national politicians to travel to Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer shot an unarmed black teenager, and he was the only elected Republican official to speak at the 2014 National Urban League conference. He's also made multiple visits to historically black colleges and universities. Former Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, an African-American Republican, also spoke at Paul's rally and will travel with the senator to South Carolina for other campaign events. Ever since Paul raised questions about provisions in the Civil Rights Act in 2010, however, he's faced scrutiny from those on the left, and Democrats are quick to bring up Paul's controversial comments whenever he tries to make inroads with minority groups. ""This is a classic example of a GOP presidential candidate thinking he can talk his way into our communities while turning his back on us when it comes to his policy prescriptions,"" said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement Tuesday. ""Not only is Rand Paul not going to make the GOP's tent any bigger, the tent actually collapses under the weight of his harmful policies."" READ: Can Rand Paul escape his father's shadow? Stephenson first met Paul before Paul started running for the Senate in 2010, according to the pastor. An ophthalmologist at the time, Paul wanted to get involved in Stephenson's after-school program run by by his church to help low-income children. When Paul started his campaign for Senate, Stephenson was featured in a Guardian article for being a black pastor that embraced the tea party movement and supported Paul. Stephenson said he didn't officially drop his affiliation with the Democratic Party until 2012, when President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage. ""He really wasn't principled enough for me,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. In comments to BuzzFeed, Stephenson questioned Obama's Christian faith, pointing to the religious freedom debate that dominated the national dialogue in the past two weeks. ""In five years we'll find out what [Obama's] real religion is,"" Stephenson said, adding that Obama will ""evolve"" again when he's out of office. He declined to be more specific.  Stephenson told CNN he also feels disenfranchised by the Democratic Party on education, wondering why they're not as supportive as Republicans of charter schools. Stephenson said doesn't agree with all of Paul's policies, particularly when it comes to foreign affairs, saying he wants to see a more robust response to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East. ""I don't know that I've gotten through to him on that yet, but I'm working on it,"" he said. He also noted that Paul is going to have ""a hard time coming into the African-American community."" ""But you know what, he's crazy enough to go in there and take the tough questions, take the smears of those traditional black Democrat leaders,"" he said. ""He's not afraid, and I'm not afraid to be seen with him, either."" READ: Rand Paul is first presidential candidate to accept donations in Bitcoin While Paul's libertarian positions on issues like criminal justice reform may pique some interest from African-Americans, Paul's small-government philosophy may clash with other interests black voters generally back, including large federally funded programs. Andra Gillespie, associate professor of political science at Emory University and an expert on minority voters and mobilization, said it's unlikely that Paul will see any short-term impact in his efforts to broaden the GOP base but that he could eventually have an effect. ""I think the long-term impact will be real but incremental and it's going to involve a lot more than what's happened so far,"" she said. She pointed to other major voter demographic shifts, like when Southern whites switched from being Democrat to Republican, that took place over decades. ""These realignments take time, and they take more time than a news cycle or an election cycle,"" she said. ""If Republicans are serious about this process of making it more diverse, they should understand that it's going to come in baby steps."" "

It marks the first time that a candidate for president has accepted purely digital campaign funds.   The Libertarian Republican is an obvious choice to test the waters. Bitcoins are an independent currency that's totally outside the realm of U.S. dollars. It's like Euros or Yen -- except bitcoins are created and distributed privately by a community of tech enthusiasts.   Bitcoin fits in with Paul's views that government should take a more ""hands off"" approach to controlling the nation's money supply, which drives up inflation and devalues the currency. He's also likely trying to draw the attention of young, tech-savvy voters.   Paul, a U.S. senator from Kentucky, announced his bid on Tuesday. His website shows he's also accepting donations in credit cards and from PayPal.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Bitcoin is frequently associated with tech geeks and crime. That's because it's a highly complex system that has famously been used on black markets online.   However, it's much more than that. It's a creative new system of money that allows for immediate, secure transactions with very low fees.   Startups are trying to build networks so that people in rich countries can more easily send money to family members in poor countries. Major banks are experimenting with ways to make faster and more convenient person-to-person payments.   There's also a concern that -- because bitcoins function outside the banking system -- they're harder to trace. That's a dangerous implication for mysterious, untraceable donations.   But that's largely unfounded. Contrary to popular belief, bitcoins are perfectly traceable (like email). And new rules from the Federal Election Commission say that politicians have to register new donors just like they do with regular U.S. dollars anyway.   To follow the rules, Paul's campaign will have to convert any bitcoins back to dollars before they use them. But they'd do that anyway. The Bitcoin-to-dollar value fluctuates a lot.

443,443,2 former federal agents charged with stealing Bitcoin during Silk Road probe,http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/30/politics/federal-agents-charged-with-stealing-bitcoin/index.html,"Mar 30, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Washington (CNN)The federal government became owners of one of the biggest troves of Bitcoin, thanks to seizing millions of dollars in the digital currency from criminals associated with the online black market Silk Road.  Two federal agents who helped lead one of several investigations in the case allegedly decided they wanted some of the money for themselves, according to a new federal court documents.  The two now-former agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service are charged with wire fraud, money laundering and other offenses for allegedly stealing Bitcoin during the federal investigation of Silk Road, an underground illicit black market federal prosecutors shut down in 2013.   READ: 1 shot dead at Fort Meade The charges in a criminal complaint filed in San Francisco federal court paints a picture of corrupt federal agents trying to enrich themselves as they tried to bring down one of the Internet's top cybercriminals. The charges against the agents could end up causing complications for the government's case against Ross Ulbricht, also known as ""Dread Pirate Roberts"", the Silk Road founder. Ulbricht was found guilty last year of aiding drug trafficking with his site.​ He is awaiting sentencing. As a result of the case against Ulbricht and others, the federal government seized bitcoin that it said at the time was valued at more than $33 million.  The agents now facing charges led a Baltimore-based murder-for-hire case against Ulbricht, separate from the drugs-related charges on which he was found guilty. The murder-for-hire case remains pending. Prosecutors identified the agents as Carl Force, 46 years old, of Baltimore, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Shaun Bridges, 32, of Laurel, Maryland, a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service.  Force was a lead agent in the case and was the main investigator communicating with Ulbricht. Force is charged with wire fraud, theft of government property, money laundering and conflict of interest.  Bridges was the computer forensics expert on the case. He is charged with wire fraud and money laundering.  Force allegedly set up fake online personas and tried to extort money from Ulbricht, including once trying to get $250,000 from him in exchange for not providing information to federal investigators, the criminal complaint says.  Using the online persona ""French Maid,"" Force did succeed in getting $100,000 in Bitcoin from Ulbricht, which Force deposited in his personal accounts, the federal complaint says. He later used a series of Bitcoin and personal U.S. dollar transactions, including a $235,000 wire transfer to an account in Panama, to launder the stolen money, prosecutors allege in the complaint.  According to prosecutors, Force also used his position as an executive at a digital currency exchange called CoinMKT, in which he was an investor, to seize accounts of customers. He transferred $297,000 in illegally-seized digital currency to his personal accounts, prosecutors allege in the criminal complaint.  Bridges allegedly stole $820,000, using a series of wire transfers to move Bitcoin that earlier had been stolen from Silk Road in early 2013 and deposited in a Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, according to prosecutors. Two days later, Bridges signed the government's warrant to seize millions of dollars in bitcoin from Mt. Gox accounts.  Later, when he learned the FBI was investigating suspicious activity in the Silk Road investigation, he transferred $250,000 from his personal account to one he shared with someone else, according to the complaint.

444,444,"Why gold could rebound to $1,400 an ounce",http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/12/investing/gold-rebound-doubleline-gundlach/index.html,"Mar 12, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," But the gold rally has come to an abrupt halt. Prices have plunged more than 11% from their highs earlier this year to about $1,150.   Much of the sell-off has taken place in the past few weeks as the dollar has strengthened.   That's key. Gold is often looked at as an alternative currency. It does well when investors are worried about the outlooks for the legal tender printed by governments.   There are no such concerns about the greenback right now.  This is a modal window.   What's next for gold? Surprisingly, some market experts are still bullish.   Jeffrey Gundlach, the well-known investing guru who runs the money management firm DoubleLine Capital, is reported to have said in a presentation earlier this week that he thinks gold could rebound to $1,400 an ounce.   His reasoning? Negative bond yields in Europe will make gold look more attractive.   Gold is an asset that often outperforms in times of both inflation and deflation. In other words, when the market is scared of something, people flock to gold.   And those negative bond rates are a tell-tale sign of deflation worries. Investors are so spooked by the prospect of falling prices that they are willing to tolerate a small loss on government bonds rather than risk bigger losses in other parts of the market.   Related: 25% of physical gold buyers are crazy, metals executive says   Still, it's important to note that Gundlach has been bullish on gold for some time. And the negative bond yields overseas may also reflect the fact that the European Central Bank is finally buying bonds right at the time that the Federal Reserve is expected to soon start raising interest rates.   Higher rates in the U.S. should make the dollar even stronger. And that could be bad for gold -- at least in the short-term.   ""It's the expectations of Fed rate hikes that are hurting gold. Momentum is bearish."" said Jeffrey Nichols, senior economic advisor with Rosland Capital.   But Nichols agrees with Gundlach. He thinks gold should eventually bounce back.   Related: Stop crying about the Fed rate hikes   Why gold will rise: Nichols acknowledged that prices will probably remain volatile for the next few months though. But he believes the growth of the middle class in China and India will lead to a big pickup in demand for gold from consumers.   ""It's only a matter of time before gold turns around,"" he said. ""Gold should climb to a much higher price over the next three to five years thanks to physical demand from emerging markets.""   Michael Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfollo fund, also thinks that there will be more foreign buyers for gold ... but it will probably be central banks holding it as an investment.   The dollar may be the currency flavor of the month right now. But what happens when the dollar eventually weakens? Many central banks may find that gold looks like a safer bet than the euro.   ""Over time, gold prices will appreciate. Russia, China, India and central banks of other countries are looking to diversify their holdings. Buyers of any type will provide a floor for gold,"" he said.   Related: The dollar is crushing other currencies   Cuggino also conceded that gold prices will jump around a lot for the foreseeable future. Still, he has about 20% of the fund's assets tied up in gold as a way to hedge against inflation and market volatility.   That's a much higher percentage than most financial advisers recommend for the average investor. But a little bit of gold as a long-term bet probably makes sense for your portfolio.   It just might be safer to buy shares of gold mining stocks or popular exchange-traded funds like the GLD (GLD) or GDX (GDX) than hoarding the actual metal in your basement. "
445,445,Buying bitcoin: Morgan Spurlock looks to live off online currency,http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/18/us/bitcoin-morgan-spurlock-inside-man/index.html,"Feb 18, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," (CNN)You've heard the term: bitcoin. But really, what is to be made of (or from) all these digital dollars? Or, more importantly, how do they work, and might you conceivably be able to eat, live and exist entirely through the use of these mysterious moneys? In the next airing of ""Morgan Spurlock Inside Man,"" the host sets out to examine all the essential elements of this most modern form of currency. And, in advance of Thursday's episode, here are the 5 W's of bitcoin. 1. What is bitcoin? Formal definitions aside, how best to explain money that you can't hold, smell or feel, yet has every bit the purchasing power of paper or plastic? In short, bitcoin was designed as a less expensive way to buy and sell goods, all around the world, while dodging pre-exisiting financial institutions.  ""Its founder wanted to create a global currency that existed outside a central bank or government,"" notes Spurlock.  ""Just a person to person system that could be used instantly and internationally."" Void of traditional surcharges and fees, but fluctuating like any other currencies, at the time of Spurlock's quest, one unit of bitcoin was equal to roughly $624 U.S.  At present, that value has dropped to $235.85 U.S.     Either way, at least it won't weigh down your pockets with a ton of silver and copper. 2. Who uses bitcoin? While the virtual money is available to anyone, it isn't accepted by everyone, yet. For the time being the electronic currency is most prevalently used, not surprisingly, by other electronic companies. According to a recent write-up in The Motley Fool, bitcoin is particularly popular on sites like Overstock.com (the first major retailer to accept it,) PayPal, 1-800-Flowers, and travel sites like Expedia. However, in his own neighborhood, Spurlock struggled to simply caffeinate his experience, repeatedly hearing that various coffee shops would not allow him to pay with bitcoin. But the host did learn that bitcoin is extremely popular, and regularly utilized, throughout the Internet's seedy underbelly. So, while java can be tough to get, drugs, guns, various documents or even a hit man are available to those with the bitcoin. Joined by Chris Tarbell, a former FBI agent who helped take down ""Silk Road,""  one of the first subsurface sites that allowed users to anonymously surf the Internet, Spurlock learns firsthand just how easy it is to cash in on illegal goods via the use of bitcoin. ""Can we go up to the prescription medication?  3,355 possibilities,"" he reads, as Tarbell helps him tour ""Silk Road 2.0.""  ""You can get Xanax, Diazepam, Viagra, Zopiclone, Valium, Modafinil, Oxycontin, generic.  It's like it's a grab bag.  We should probably go to psychedelics."" So, while bitcoin may not yet get you a grande espresso with whipped cream, you can use it to satisfy other, slightly more sinister -- and illegal --  addictions. 3. Where is bitcoin (and how can I use it)? Loosely stated, bitcoin is everywhere, and anywhere, as the the creators designed the currency to be used worldwide. But specifically, it's in your wallet --  though Prada, Kate Spade, Coach and Gucci won't help you here.  To use bitcoin, you'll need a digital wallet, something you download. In learning about the product, Spurlock got some guidance. ""So you want to search by Aegis Wallet, that's one of the top ones right now. Install that, click that,"" explains an expert on the bitcoin trading floor.   Once you're outfitted with your digital wallet, an NFC chip serves as a password and helps encrypt -- and thus protect -- your bitcoin account.  The account is given an address, not unlike an email address, that is identifiable by a unique QR code. And it's this QR code that is scanned upon the acquisition of bitcoin, as well as during the purchase of goods at participating vendors. Once scanned, money is then transferred in and out of accounts. So, while your new wallet may not be 100% leather, it is plenty comfortable enough to carry your bitcoin. 4. When will bitcoin be released, fully, into circulation? 2140. That's the projected date by which experts expect to see the full lot of bitcoin -- roughly 21 million units -- released into circulation. At present, digital miners are working feverishly to solve complex mathematical problems, the completion of which result in the release of additional bitcoin. The cap was placed in the beginning as a way to guard against inflation.  ""As the popularity of bitcoin increases, the bitcoin network automatically changes the difficulty of the math problem being solved,"" learns the ""Inside Man.""  ""That means it continually takes more power and more energy to release the new bitcoin, stabilizing the rate that new bitcoin are released into circulation."" The moral of the story: Buy your bitcoin now, before the virtual well dries up. 5. Why use bitcoin? Quite simply, bitcoin makes sense. And cents. For the user, the exchange eliminates clunky transfer surcharges, while for vendors it increases profit and eliminates fear of fraud. ""So every time I wire money every month to my free checking, free wire account it cost me $25.00,"" reveals the host. However, for his bitcoin purchase - -1 unit for $623.00 dollars -- the fee was 6/10th of one cent. Meanwhile, for Brooklyn Bodegas, a food store that served as a grocery guinea pig, the use of bitcoin minimizes proprietor risk. ""You know, credit card fraud is so prevalent today and, you know, as a small business owner you assume that risk,"" explained Van, a store employee.  ""So if there was another option to where, you know, that was cheaper, that was safer, bitcoin at this point in time is able to do that."" "
446,446,Breaking the bank: Bitcoins hit Africa's money transfer traditions,http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/17/business/bitcoin-africa-unbanked/index.html,"Feb 17, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"CNN Marketplace Africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent's key industries and corporations.  (CNN)Money makes the world go round, they say, but what if notes and coins were replaced with online code? Bitcoin  -- the world's much talked about cryptocurrency -- is just that. It can't be printed, it can't be directly controlled by governments or central banks, but it can be sent around the world instantly at a low cost. And in sub-Saharan Africa, where 75% of the population don't have a bank account, experts say the currency could help millions of people pay bills and get to grips with their finances. Transferring cash via a bank or a Money Transfer Operator (MTOs) like Western Union or MoneyGram can be costly. According to the Overseas Development Institute, the average charge to transfer $200 to Africa using traditional money transfer services is 12%. If you send $200, you pay $24. The ODI added up all the transfers that happen in a year, and found remittance fees cost the African continent $1.8 billion a year.  What if that money could be spent on things, rather than fees? As Bitcoin is a virtual peer-to-peer currency -- designed to operate on the border-less internet -- the costs of transferring money can be radically cheaper than traditional methods, and the process is much quicker. ""Bitcoin can greatly alter the remittances industry and beyond,"" says Michael Kimani, who heads the African Digital Currency Association, a Kenya-based group launched last May to promote digital currency technologies. ""From seven days [for a transaction to clear] using banks & PayPal, down to 20 minutes speaks volumes."" African examples Beam is a service in Ghana that converts Bitcoin sent from abroad into the local currency,  cedi. Since launching three months ago, it has attracted 30 users who pay a 3% fee on each transaction rather than the average 12% from traditional transfer services. Ghana received $1.7 billion of remittance income in 2012 according to the Bank of Ghana, and Beam's founders are optimistic about the future. ""Bitcoin is going to make a huge difference when it starts to get accepted by merchants in Ghana,"" says CEO Nikunj Handa. ""People won't need to change Bitcoin to any other currency so there will be no broker fees involved and people can get really very low-cost transactions. But Bitcoin is in its early days yet, and we need banks and merchants to catch up."" And the founders are also planning to launch ""Value Remittances"" -- a service which will allow people in other countries to use Bitcoin to pay the water, electricity and phone bills for their family members in Ghana.  Kitiwa, a similar service in Ghana, says it has processed over $90,000 worth of Bitcoins, and BitPesa, in Kenya, is another remittance services doing the same thing but with Kenyan shillings. Another sign that Bitcoin is gaining traction in Africa came in August, when Johannesburg got the first Bitcoin ATM on the continent.   The machine, which converts cash into Bitcoin, is located at the Metroman beauty salon where customers can pay in crytocurrency.  But it's not the only place South Africans can spend their Bitcoin. According to South Africa-based Bitcoin startup Xoin, 30,000 online stores in South Africa now accept the cryptocurrency.  ""We have about five transactions a week, and in total I would estimate we have had about 250 transactions,"" explains Rolf Deppe, who operates the machine. ""The main reason we launched the ATM was to create awareness of Bitcoin in Africa... We do expect to see more [Bitcoin] ATMs popping up."" Commission charges for Bitcoin ATMs vary, but Lamassu says the average commission is 5%. And Africa's second Bitcoin ATM is set to arrive in Cape Town soon -- a city hosting a Bitcoin conference in April. Crypto-critics But not everyone is so optimistic about Bitcoin's future in Africa.  Critics say the fees associated with buying crypto-currency must be taken into account when considering the cost of remittances. As well as overcoming the technical challenges of obtaining Bitcoins at an ""exchange,"" users have to also pay a commission. According to Lamassu, the fee is usually 0.5%, but that can vary between exchanges. Bypassing most of the online process is possible with voucher services like Azte, which charges a 4% commission for the convenience. And Xoin, based in Stellenbosch, have come up with a similar proposition involving QR codes on vouchers, which you scan with your smartphone. As well as standard charges, not all banks support Bitcoin companies yet. Some customers of British banks, for example, have to first transfer money from their bank account to a Bitcoin company's account in a European bank. To do this, they pay banking transfer charges and have to wait up to five days for the funds to clear before they get their Bitcoins. Not exactly speedy. Breaking traditions Competition with existing, established services is also a major reason some say widespread adoption of Bitcoin in Africa is still a long way off. MoneyGram has agents in 25,000 locations across Africa, and Western Union has 32,000 registered locations across the continent. While its yellow and black outposts aren't going away anytime soon, the company is adapting to mobile money transfer.  ""Africa, in particular, is kind of at the frontiers of mobile,"" says Hikmet Ersek, chief executive of Western Union. ""The people do like mobile, use it like mobile... but also as a wallet. This mobile wallet has been very successful in Kenya. We did not see a big success in other countries...but the future, I think, will be that, once the consumer figures out how to use it."" It is precisely this complexity, and this issue of trust, which makes the man who founded South Africa's Bitcoin exchange ICE³X.com skeptical about it's widespread adoption on the continent. ""You've got a company like Western Union, which has been around for longer than most people have been alive, and they trust that method,"" says Gareth Grobler. ""That's a huge stumbling block for Bitcoin acceptance."" For Grobler, the real value of the super-secure ""blockchain"" technology which facilitates Bitcoin could be in commodities trading where large sums need to be transferred across borders in a transparent way. Erratic price value  Another major issue with Bitcoin is its volatility. In January 2013, one Bitcoin was worth around $13, surging in December to a high of $1,147. But since then, its value has dropped again and at the time of writing one Bitcoin was worth $221, according to coindesk.

Issac's Singapore-based company, Polychemy, is using 3-D printers to make personalized jewelry -- think nameplate necklaces available in a dozen languages, or sports team logo pendants. And forget fashion shows -- he's getting his design cues from big data.   ""We're a very data-driven company; we analyze what people are searching for on Google,"" Issac said. ""People are searching for things that are very specific -- for example, a gold ring with a diamond, ring size 8.5. We try to measure the demand, and then we develop that type of jewelry.""   Experts say Issac has tapped into a sweet spot, and that specialized companies like Polychemy will see the biggest growth as the 3-D printing industry explodes. The overall market for 3-D printed goods is expected to quadruple to $16.2 billion by 2018, according to tech research firm Canalys.   Because it's still too expensive and complicated to use high-quality 3-D printers at home, commercial outfits will be in demand as consumers look for ways to produce original designs.   Related: 3-D printed organs are on the way   3-D printing is a great technique for producing jewelry, because ""what people want is something special, and there's nothing better than to produce something with someone's name on it, a symbol that is important, perhaps even a picture or an object valuable to the person,"" said Joe Kempton of Canalys.   So how exactly does a 3-D printer make luxury jewelry?   At Polychemy, 3-D printers produce a wax mold that is cast into metal; gems are then set before the entire piece is polished.   Polychemy has about 40 customizable jewelry designs that sell for $100 to $250 apiece, and customers have their pick of precious metals, gems and text. One software program generates a unique snowflake design from a few billion possibilities each time a user clicks refresh.

The two senators were key attractions at a conference in Washington hosted by LincolnLabs, a group of entrepreneurs and digital operatives that hosted a similar event in Silicon Valley last year. ""I love tech,"" Cruz said, kicking off his speech to the crowd and not-so subtly mentioning that both of his parents were computer programmers. READ: Huckabee heads to Holy Land The 2008 presidential election saw an infusion of tech with politics, and President Barack Obama's savvy operation has widely been referenced as the precedent for harnessing data and digital models for political campaigns. Many of Silicon Valley's biggest names -- and their wallets -- are considered potentially big power players in the 2016 presidential election. Bush, whose last campaign took place in 2002 -- long before the political world got smart on tech -- has attempted to show that he's still ahead in the digital realm.  ""I was digital before digital was cool I guess,"" he said in December, noting his prolific use of email as governor of Florida from 1999-2007.  His Blackberry can be seen in his official portrait. But two incidents this week revealed Bush might not have caught up with modern times. In an effort this week to show his transparency and accessibility, Bush released 250,000 emails to the public, but the dump included some personal information like names, emails and even Social Security numbers -- a huge no-no for online documents. The error was first reported by the tech blog, The Verge. Bush's digital efforts were also in the spotlight after his team was forced to let go of their chief technology officer one day after announcing the hire. The aide resigned after it was made public that he deleted part of his online footprint, including tweets that referred to women as ""sluts"" and commented on gay men at the gym. Critics were quick to pounce on the dust-ups this week and question whether Bush was ready for a presidential campaign at a time when digital advances help expose even the tiniest errors. Bush's kerfuffles did not surface in any of Thursday's panel discussions or speeches at the conference, which took place at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. But they provided a noticeable contrast to the fluency with which Paul and Cruz spoke in addressing topics like Internet privacy and online start-ups. This was also not the kind of crowd that goes gaga over the daily drama of national politics, nor was it a kitschy, swag filled convention with people exhibiting their apps or running around with selfie sticks (cue Obama joke). There was no enter or exit music as speakers took the stage, no gimmicky videos. Rather it was a sober, more academic conference with lengthy, no-frills discussions about the intersection of politics and the tech sector -- and namely, how government regulations get in the way of entrepreneurship.  ""Which has greater innovation: the United States Post Office, or Facebook and Twitter? Which has greater innovation: Taxi commissions in local cities, or Lyft and Uber? Every time you put unelected bureaucrats in charge of the market, they stifle innovation,"" Cruz said. In his traditional form, the Texas Republican paced back and forth and spoke about net neutrality and Internet sales tax with just as much gusto as if he were firing off a rant on Obamacare. He especially sought to drive home the point that the private sector is far better at providing services than government. After his speech, he stuck around for a nearly hour-long panel with a crew of mostly millennials working at start-ups. Paul, meanwhile, took a more laid back approach, slouching in a chair on stage as a moderator, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, casually quizzed Paul on issues ranging from bitcoin to the federal bank to internet service providers or ""monopolies,"" as Paul called them.  Paul, whose political operation has started to open an office in San Francisco and has aggressively courted donors and supporters in Silicon Valley, sought to define himself as someone who can bridge people at a time of hyper-partisanship. The Kentucky Republican noted that he got raucous applause from the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington last year, then delivered the same speech at the University of California, Berkeley, and got a similar response. ""There is a unifying belief in personal liberty,"" he said. ""I think there are a lot of people who just want to be left alone."" "

Hug calls these people ""crazies"" and says they form a substantial amount of the U.S. physical gold market -- at least 25%.   It's no secret that gold has long been viewed as a form of insurance against disaster. The thinking is that even if the financial or political system collapses, gold will still hold value.   The yellow metal is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and the collapse of the dollar. Those are two things gold bugs have been deeply worried about given the massive amount of money printing the Federal Reserve has done since the Great Recession.   Related: Winklevoss twins say Bitcoin is better than gold   The end-of-the-world trade: Hug's comments at the Inside ETF Conference last month may raise some eyebrows because he is an executive at one of the largest online retailers of precious metals in North America.   These so-called crazy gold provide lots of business for Kitco. He said their influence is most obvious in the market for smaller units of physical gold between one and 32 ounces.   ""These investors buy the metal and it just disappears. It goes under their mattress. They want to use it when the world ends,"" Hug told CNNMoney.   Related: Tim Geithner says Europe may be in worse spot than Japan   Irrational fears or smart safeguards? Peter Schiff, an outspoken gold investors for years, said this characterization of gold buyers is unfair.   ""The fears of an economic collapse in the United States are not irrational. I think it's more irrational when people are complacent that nothing can go wrong,"" Schiff told CNNMoney.   It's tough to second guess those who bet on gold before the meltdown of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Prices spiked from around $800 an ounce in late 2007 to more than $1,800 in 2011 as central bankers raced to stabilize the financial system and get out of the Great Recession.   Where's the hyperinflation? Yet inflation remains nonexistent. Heck, deflation is more of a concern right now in many parts of the world. That's partially why gold has dipped to under $1,250 an ounce today.   Schiff concedes that some people are so paranoid that they own nothing but physical gold.   ""That is being too fearful and maybe obsessed with it. But is that any less rational than the person who owns no gold whatsoever?"" he asked.   Schiff said his brokerage firm, which sells physical gold for delivery, recommends people have 5% to 15% of their investment portfolio in physical gold.   Related: Gold is sexy again   Playing the fear card: Hug, a Canadian, said the fear trade is far more common in the U.S. than it is north of the border. This could partially be because Canada's financial system is viewed as less risky than Wall Street and experienced far less stress in 2008.   ""You can't play the fear card if you're a dealer or a speaker as well in Canada as you can in the United States,"" he said. "
450,450,Silk Road founder's parents speak out,http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/03/technology/silk-road-founder-parents-ulbricht/index.html,"Feb 3, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The trial for Ross Ulbricht, creator of underground site Silk Road, is underway.   Ulbricht, 30, is accused of everything from money laundering to drug trafficking. Launched in 2011, Silk Road was an unregulated online marketplace where users could buy and sell anything from drugs to hacking tutorials. Payments were made using bitcoin, a digital currency that's difficult to trace, and the site used software that let users browse anonymously.   Over the past weeks, prosecutors have said Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the site. According to the feds, he went by the name Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in the movie The Princess Bride. They say they've traced around $13 million in bitcoin to Ross's computer.   Ulbricht's attorney Josh Dratel argued that while Ulbricht created Silk Road, it became too much for him and he handed it off to another operator. In court, the defense pointed fingers at former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. The testimony was later ruled inadmissible by the judge, who called it ""hearsay,"" according to Wired.   In an exclusive interview, Ulbricht's parents, Lyn and Kirk, sit down with CNNMoney. Despite the government's case against Ulbricht, his parents maintain their son's innocence.   CNNMoney: Lyn, can you take me to that moment when you got the call? Ross was in trouble. What went through your mind?   Lyn: It was shocking because Ross had never been in trouble and has no record of anything.  This is a modal window.   Kirk: It was like a bomb went off in the house. We had no idea anything like that was coming.   CNNMoney: Tell me about the Ross you know.   Lyn: Ross is a stellar human being. He is such a fine person -- friendly, compassionate, caring -- and has demonstrated that his whole life. In the prison he gave yoga classes, he gave physics classes. We had a guard take us aside and go, ""I just want you to know how much I think of Ross. He's such a great person.""   CNNMoney: As his parents, why do you think he created Silk Road?   Lyn: He's very idealistic and I could see Ross thinking, ""I want to create an open market where people can freely trade."" Ross was the perfect fall guy because he's very trusting.   CNNMoney: The prosecution has traced a lot of money back to Ross. What do you think Ross's role was?   Lyn: I have no idea. I would like to see the evidence. We want to bring our own bitcoin expert in and they are fighting us ... we can't speculate on anything.   Related: Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht found guilty    CNNMoney: Let's get into the trial. Part of why you want to speak out is you're frustrated.   Lyn: The most frustrating thing is that evidence that is favorable to Ross is being suppressed. This came out in the cross examination for the first witness -- DHS Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, who was on the Silk Road case for two years investigating it. [He] never came across Ross' name but did ... pinpoint another name which he said was Mark Karpeles. He was closing in on [Karpeles] when another DHS agency [inadvertently] tipped off Karpeles.   The next thing that happened, according to this evidence, is that Karpeles' lawyer approached this DHS agency and said look, ""You don't charge me with the financial crimes you're charging me with and I'll give you the name of DPR [Dread Pirate Roberts]."" Two weeks later, Ross was arrested and Karpeles has never been charged.   [The judge later ruled] that much of that testimony must be stricken from the record.   Related: The Deep Web you don't know about   CNNMoney: What do you believe are the larger implications of this trial?   Lyn: You know there is a big issue of transferred intent here, which is, can you hold an alleged website host responsible for actions of the users on his site? If a precedent is set for that, many people have said it puts a crack in the door for the government to find something illegitimate on a site and be able to hold that website responsible for that. That will put a chill on the Internet.   CNNMoney: Who should be responsible? Because if you look at Silk Road, there was a lot of illicit activity going on.    Lyn: We can't comment on that.   CNNMoney: Is it possible there's a whole other side to Ross that you guys just didn't know?   Lyn: I think in 30 years, there would have been a glimmer among either us, his family, all his friends and everyone who knew him. It just isn't logical ... this drug kingpin thing. The guy was living in a very simple apartment, living a very simple life. So many things don't add up.   Kirk: I feel like I know Ross as well as a father can know a son. We were very close. We've heard how many chat logs and conversations between DPR and these other people. DPR didn't talk like Ross or write like Ross. It's just not Ross.   CNNMoney: How are you guys doing?   Lyn: It's very hard. Ross does not belong in prison. We will do what we can to fight for him and to fight for a fair trial. That's our basic right. Ross is a precious person. He has a lot to give and it would be a horrible waste to have him rot in prison. It really would. "
451,451,Bitcoin fallacy led to Silk Road founder's conviction,http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/05/technology/security/bitcoin-silk-road/index.html,"Feb 5, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The latest example? The guilty verdict in the trial of Ross Ulbricht, the kingpin behind the online drug bazaar Silk Road.   His attorney took a stunningly odd approach to his defense: Yes, Ulbricht ran the site. Yes, those millions of dollars in bitcoins are his. But he stopped running Silk Road a long time ago.   Here's why that logic didn't work: Federal prosecutors showed that millions of dollars in Bitcoin payments were traced from Silk Road back to Ulbricht's personal laptop -- until just before his arrest.   How was that possible? Here's a mini crash course in Bitcoin.   Related: What is Bitcoin   Bitcoin is all about electronic wallets that send digital cash directly to one another. All you need is a Bitcoin wallet address. You never need to know someone's real name. And at the center of it all is the engine that keeps the system alive: a public record of all transactions called ""the blockchain.""   It seems anonymous at first -- but only if you keep your wallet address secret. If that's connected to your name, the whole world knows every transaction you've ever made.   That's why Bitcoin's notoriety as the tech-savvy criminal's currency of choice is absolute lunacy. Bitcoins track everything. Some Bitcoin users have even taken to calling them ""prosecution futures.""   In Ulbricht's case, it all came down to what happened in a New York federal court on January 29.   That was the day jurors heard testimony from Ilhwan Yum, the FBI agent who examined the Silk Road website's computer servers in Iceland and Ulbricht's confiscated laptop. He cross-referenced Bitcoin wallet addresses found in each computer to the blockchain itself -- and voilà.   From September 2012 until August 2013, Ulbricht's personal laptop received 3,760 transactions from the Silk Road worth 700,254 bitcoins, the FBI agent said. That means Ulbricht had received the equivalent of $18 million over that time.   ""I didn't do any complicated analysis,"" Yum said in court, noting that the publicly available blockchain records made it even easier to figure out than if a criminal had used a legitimate bank. At least that takes a subpoena.   The numbers also showed that 89% of the bitcoins that made it to Ulbricht's laptop came straight from the online black market. That didn't jibe with his defense attorney's story that they all came from his Bitcoin trading.   Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratel, protested that he was blindsided by this in-depth FBI analysis of Bitcoin wallets and transfers. But it was too late. He should have known, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest said. Outside security researchers, like Stanford's Nicholas Weaver, had already determined that a sizable portion of Ulbricht's Bitcoin stash came from Silk Road.   As computer scientist Sarah Meiklejohn warned last year, ""Every Bitcoin is by nature a marked bill. All that's required is putting together some pieces.""   That's why Ulbricht's trial is so curious. It's among the first times that truly electronic money played a major role in determining someone's role in a crime. The jury found Ulbricht guilty on all seven counts related to money laundering, hacking, trafficking forged identities and distributing narcotics.   And Ulbricht's defense -- saying he actually owned the bitcoins -- made it so easy that U.S. prosecutors told CNNMoney they were flabbergasted (before the verdict was even out).   Think of what federal prosecutor Timothy Howard told the judge in court last week.   ""At the end of the day, it is all based on public records showing one-to-one connections between Bitcoin addresses. It is not anything very complicated,"" he said.   Now that should make criminals think twice.   Jose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago).  This is a modal window.   "

The brothers, known for their legal battle with Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg, believe the controversial cryptocurrency is the payments network of the future. That's despite Bitcoin's 60% plunge in 2014.   They predict Bitcoin's market capitalization could easily skyrocket to at least $400 billion, or roughly the combined size of modern day payments companies like American Express (AXP), Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Western Union (WU).   But the Internet entrepreneurs are taking it one step further. They believe Bitcoin could one day morph into a gold-like asset class -- or even surpass it.   ""If Bitcoin is a better gold or seen as a type of gold-like asset, then it could be in the trillions on a market cap,"" Tyler Winklevoss told CNNMoney. ""We do feel those are very real possibilities.""

Buying opportunity? Don't tell that to the Winklevii, as they are sometimes called. The twins are huge backers of Bitcoin and stand to profit handsomely if their vision comes true.   They're not worried by the currency's recent glitches or its price decline. One Bitcoin is currently worth about $265 -- a big drop-off from its peak of more than $1,200 back in late 2013.   ""It's a buying opportunity. We've never sold a Bitcoin. We're in it for the long haul,"" Cameron Winklevoss said during a presentation at ETF.com's Inside ETFs Conference.     Related: Spent bitcoins? Expect a tax headache   But the WInklevoss twins realize Bitcoin needs help. The 2014 bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, has raised questions about the currency's security. Price declines and volatility also spook some potential investors.   ""People get fixated on the cost,"" Cameron Winklevoss said. ""It's going to have lots of gyrations, but it's new and you have to bare with it.""   Improving the system: To help Bitcoin get through its growing pains, the twins are building infrastructure aimed at legitimizing and securing the currency. Last week they unveiled Gemini, a Bitcoin exchange for U.S. consumers. They hope it will become the ""Nasdaq of Bitcoin.""   They may have been beaten to the punch by Coinbase, a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange that opened on Monday with backing from the likes of the New York Stock Exchange.   Second, the Winklevoss twins are awaiting regulatory approval for the first exchange-traded fund holding Bitcoins. Just like GLD (GLD), the popular gold ETF, the fund would trade securities based off of Bitcoin.   At least one ETF veteran believes the idea of a Bitcoin ETF may have some merit.   ""The ETF structure is allowing more and more asset classes to become investable -- and Bitcoin is one of those,"" Dodd Kittsley, head of ETF strategy at Deutsche Bank, told CNNMoney. ""This could be a great potential solution. We've seen it in less liquid markets like fixed income.""   The twins believe such an ETF would appeal to gold bugs because Bitcoin, just like gold, can be used as a hedge against inflation. They say Bitcoin is more durable, divisible and affordable than the yellow metal.   ""If you like gold, there are many reasons you should like Bitcoin,"" said Cameron Winklevoss.   Of course, gold has been around as an asset class for thousands of years. By comparison, Bitcoin is still just a baby.   ""Wars have been fought over gold.

Delta (DAL) CEO Richard Anderson said in a statement that lower fuel prices should save the company more than $2 billion this year. But travelers shouldn't expect any fare cuts anytime soon.   That may not be what consumers want to hear. But Wall Street is happy. Shares of Delta rose more than 7% on the news.   The airline is already doing well. Delta reported a fourth-quarter profit, excluding one-time charges, that topped expectations Tuesday.   Related: Falling oil's next victim   Top stocks: Now the forecast for Delta looks even sunnier. Delta promised strong profit margins for the first quarter and predicted earnings growth in the double digits for the full year.   Delta, along with other airlines, were among the top performers on Wall Street last year thanks largely to lower fuel costs. The stock gained nearly 70% in 2014.   Southwest (LUV), which will report earnings on Thursday, soared about 120% last year, making it the best stock in the S&P 500. Its shares rose on Tuesday morning as well.   So did the stocks of rivals United Continental (UAL), American (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK). Those four airlines will also report their latest results in the coming days.   Shares of smaller airlines Spirit (SAVE) and recent IPO Virgin America (VA) also gained altitude on Tuesday.   Related: Will Bitcoin ever rebound?    Fuel drop was a surprise: But while the sudden plunge in fuel costs is sure to help the airlines for the rest of the year, Delta did take a hit in the fourth quarter as a result of how fast they fell.   The airline technically reported a loss due mostly to a $1.2 billion charge it took to adjust for the cost of fuel-hedging contracts that had been set up in anticipation of higher energy prices.   Most airlines use such hedges so they don't get caught off guard by a big spike in fuel costs.   Still, it appears that investors are more excited about the possibility of cheaper fuel in the future than about the hedging mishap.   Lower energy prices also mean that consumers and business travelers are more willing to fly as well. To that end, Delta said that its revenues were up nearly 6% in the fourth quarter.   Related: Why is United Airlines suing a 22-year-old?   More passengers, more money: Passenger revenue in the United States surged nearly 11%, a clear sign that Americans are taking to the friendly skies in droves.   But the increase in Delta's overall sales was higher than the increase in passenger traffic and capacity. That shows that Delta and other airlines are also doing well thanks to a litany of surcharges that travelers are now forced to pay.   So will lower fuel prices eventually lead to reduced fares now that the airlines are raking in big profits? Don't bet on it.   During a conference call with analysts, Delta chief revenue officer Glen Hauenstein said that the company does not want to turn the airline into a ""commoditized"" business that is just about lower prices.   He noted that Detla has a great record for on-time departures and arrivals and added that the airline is more interested in offering consumers what they want than focusing on cheap fares.   That's a lot different than how the airline industry used to be run. The business was notorious for fare wars and frequent bankruptcies. It seems like the wave of mergers over the past few years has changed that -- to the delight of investors.

456,456,Will Bitcoin ever rebound?,http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/15/investing/bitcoin-prices/index.html,"Jan 15, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value last year. The digital currency has already plunged another 30% in the first few days of 2015 -- and that includes a 30% rebound on Thursday!   The price of Bitcoin (XBT) briefly fell below $200 on Wednesday, an important psychological barrier, before bouncing back.   According to Bitcoin news site Coindesk, it is not profitable for people to process transactions or mine for Bitcoins when the price falls below $200. ""Mining"" is the term used to describe the complex math puzzles solved by computer networks in exchange for new Bitcoins.   So what's next for Bitcoin? There is an intense debate about its future.   Bitcoin was a bubble that has burst. Jeffrey Gundlach, head of influential investment firm DoubleLine, is firmly in the Bitcoin bear camp. In a webcast on Tuesday, Gundlach declared that Bitcoin is ""on its way to being relegated to the ash heap of digital currencies.""   Those comments may be one of the reasons why Bitcoin plunged on Wednesday.   But is it fair to focus on Bitcoin's price as a measure of failure or success? This is a currency after all.   Related: Bitcoin was one of the tech failures of 2014   The problem is that some fans of Bitcoin seem to think that it is also something that could be a good investment.   And that does not appear to be the case. The price has swung violently over the past few years with little rhyme or reason.  This is a modal window.   Some Bitcoin proponents have argued that the fact that Bitcoins are not printed by sovereign nations is a plus that should boost its value. There are a finite supply of Bitcoins determined by an algorithm.   But that doesn't justify why the price should have hit an all-time high above $1,100 back in November 2013.   The surge in Bitcoin prices back then was a classic speculative mania, just like Internet stocks in the late 1990s and houses in the mid-2000s.   When people say that the price of something should keep going up indefinitely, that often means that too many people are chasing that asset higher ... and it's really due for a painful crash.   But Bitcoin is not dead. Still, it appears that the dust may have finally settled on Bitcoin. For that reason, it may be wrong to declare that it's on the way to obsolescence.   That's the argument of prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has invested in Bitcoin wallet startup Coinbase.   Andreessen defended Bitcoin -- and attacked its many detractors -- in an epic tweetstorm last week. (26 enumerated tweets in a period of 48 minutes!)   Related: Spent bitcoins? Expect a tax headache   His main argument was that Bitcoin is an ecosystem, a method of payment. The focus on Bitcoin as if it were something investors should trade doesn't make sense.   Here are a few of his most salient points.   ""Attacking Bitcoin for having speculative levels of volatility is missing the point of how the system was designed for this point in time,"" he wrote in one tweet.   ""In the short run, Bitcoin is still highly useful as a transaction and trust network in many uses cases even with high volatility,"" he added.   He is right about that. There is a reason why several big companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Dell and online retailer Overstock (OSTK) are accepting Bitcoins as payment.   You can also use Bitcoins to purchase gift cards from retailers such as Target  (TGT)and Amazon (AMZN). And a growing number of local small businesses have embraced Bitcoin too.   Andreessen also noted that ""cherry-picking"" specific date points to use when discussing the price changes also is disingenuous.   Anyone that bought a Bitcoin at the end of 2012, for example, is still sitting on a huge gain.   So it's probably a mistake to declare the end of Bitcoin just yet. In fact, there's even a website devoted to Bitcoin obituary stories ... that have so far proven to be all wrong.   Bitcoin has apparently died 32 times already. "

This week, the trial for Ross Ulbricht, the man the U.S. government accuses of running underground forum Silk Road, will begin in federal court in Manhattan.   The story reads like a Hollywood drama: Over a year ago, authorities arrested 30-year-old Ulbricht in the San Francisco public library. He is accused of being the kingpin behind the underground marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell everything from drugs to fake passports to hacking services.   Ulbricht faces a range of charges -- from drug trafficking and money laundering to hacking and criminal enterprise. Before Silk Road was seized, it's estimated the site earned more than $80 million dollars in over two years.   The online forum launched in 2011. Users accessed Silk Road through software that enabled them to browse anonymously. The site transformed into a black market where people paid with bitcoin, a digital currency that proved difficult to trace. The site was shut down in 2013 when Ulbricht was arrested.   Related: The Deep Web you don't know about   Prosecutors say Ulbricht went by the name Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in the movie Princess Bride. They have photos of what they claim are nine of Ulbricht's fake IDs as well as journal logs and screenshots of log-in information. During the trial, they will try to prove Ulbricht was the mastermind behind Silk Road.   At one point, Ulbricht faced even more serious charges. He was accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire as part of a plan to protect the site. Five of those charges have been dropped but one charge remains on the table in Maryland. While there is no evidence that any of the murders were carried out, Judge Katherine Forrest, who is overseeing the trial, ruled the evidence was admissible to use in Ulbricht's trial.   Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his defense questions how the government obtained access to Silk Road's server. Both friends and family say he's innocent. A site devoted to Ulbricht's case describes him as an Eagle Scout -- and honest and trustworthy.   While there are several other sites that host illicit illegal activity on the web, Silk Road was the first to shed light on the underground and unregulated web. It's uncharted territory, and Internet activists will be watching closely to see how the trial plays out. "
458,458,Spent bitcoins? Expect a tax headache,http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/technology/bitcoin-taxes/index.html,"Jan 7, 2015","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   This upcoming tax season will be the first time many Bitcoin users take a crack paying taxes on their digital currency purchases. It was only last year that Bitcoin got popular enough that Overstock.com, Microsoft and others started accepting it as a payment method.   The IRS said in 2014 that Bitcoin is a property, not a currency. So, prepare to carefully pore over every single item you bought last year with bitcoins.   First, the basic rule: The government views Bitcoin kind of like company stock. If it increases in value and you sell it, you experience a ""gain"" -- like a capital gain -- and must report it as income.   Now for reality: The value of a bitcoin steadily slid last year by 58%. It started the year at $748 per bitcoin and ended at $317. It performed worse than the Russian ruble. So you likely didn't experience any gains, and you don't owe taxes.      Let's say you're the average person who dipped toes into Bitcoin, maybe buying a single bitcoin and spending some of it on a few items throughout the year.   You'll have to compare the value of the original bitcoin with the value of the portion you spent.   For example, let's say you bought 0.1 BTC for $60 in July and the value fell to half in October. That's when you spent it at a high-tech bar. That portion was then worth $30. You experienced a $30 loss.   Now repeat that over and over again.      This gets wildly confusing if you acquired Bitcoin several times, explained New York tax lawyer Tyler S. Robbins. If you just kept adding bitcoins to your wallet, it's like pouring water into a glass. How do you determine an ""original value?"" You can't. They're all mixed in together.   ""This is extremely burdensome -- a lot of headache for ridiculously small dollar amounts,"" said Omri Y. Marian, who teaches law at the University of Florida.   Ironically, it'll be worst for those who used Bitcoin most trivially. The accounting is actually easier for those who bought large amounts as a risky investment and sold it in a few, large chunks.   Some accountants say Bitcoin users can claim the drop in the digital currency's value as a capital loss up to $3,000. This lowers your overall income, shrinking how much you owe in taxes.   Luckily, Bitcoin keeps a perfect, public record of transactions. And most Bitcoin wallet software programs, like Blockchain.info, offer simple ways to export your data into a spreadsheet.   There's even an automated Bitcoin calculator, called LibraTax, that's free as long as you're counting 500 or fewer transactions. You just plug in your wallet IDs. It took me only 10 minutes calculate my 2014 bitcoin purchases.   In the rare case you did experience a gain and owe taxes, your accountant will probably charge you an extra $25 to $100 for that one line item, according to W. Hunter Robinson, an accountant in Memphis, Tenn. You'll have to use an additional tax form, called an 8949.   This is why many people thought the IRS made a mistake by not classifying Bitcoin as a currency. If it did, that would let you ignore most price fluctuations, similar to spending euros or yen while on vacation.   In the end, most people are likely to just ignore these rules and not report a thing, according to Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.   ""The rules are too complicated, and they result in a bizarre answer,"" he said.   Jose Pagliery is the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money (Triumph Books, Chicago).

It was a more innocent time. This year, people wanted to know if they had Ebola.  Google has released its annual round-up of the year's top global searches. Apple, Facebook and other companies also do these recaps, but those only show what we bought or posted publicly on social media. Our search history is a more honest, sometimes embarrassing, peek into what we really care about.  In 2014, the entire world was sad about the passing of Robin Williams, excited to watch the World Cup and worried about Ebola. Those three topics top the list of global trending searches, which also includes missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, the viral phenomenon Ice Bucket Challenge, addictive smartphone game Flappy Bird and Eurovision winner and drag queen Conchita Wurst.  Celebrity deaths tend to dominate Google's year-end lists. Last year Paul Walker was the top trending topic after dying in a car accident, and Nelson Mandela and ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith were in the top five. Google breaks out a special, sad category of ""trending celebrity losses"" to show the deceased celebrities we searched for most. Following Williams on this year's list were Joan Rivers, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Maya Angelou and Jan Hooks.  Most popular global searches for living people were Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Kardashian. French actress Julie Gayet was third on the list, likely because of allegations that she had an affair with French President Francois Hollande. Tracy Morgan's tragic car accident and Renee Zellweger's new look also stoked our curiosity. In the United States, domestic abuse made NFL's Ray Rice a top searched for person, and NASCAR driver Tony Stewart was a top topic after he struck and killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a race.  Google is a first stop for questions people may be to embarrassed to ask their friends. This year's top ""What is..."" queries included Ebola, ALS, ISIS, Bitcoin and asphyxia. Apple's Airdrop feature, which lets you share files between Apple devices, was either very popular or very confusing. It made the list of top ""What is..."" searches and was the top trending ""How to..."" search for the year. After sharing files, we just wanted to know how to contour with makeup, vote, kiss and craft.  Google is a popular first stop for looking up various health symptoms. Ebola was the top term here too, but it wasn't the only ailment we thought we might have in 2014. The top searches for symptoms also included the flu, pregnancy, Aspergers, and spurred on by the Ice Bucket Challenge, ALS.  Like hypochondriacs, dog owners also take to Google in large numbers.

467,467,Why Apple is defending Microsoft in court,http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/15/technology/microsoft-search-warrant/index.html,"Dec 15, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Microsoft thinks it knows the answer and is fighting in court to prove its point.   At a press gathering in New York on Monday, Microsoft (MSFT) laid out its case for why it is refusing to comply with a federal subpoena and search warrant for some customers' emails. The emails live in a data center in Ireland. And Microsoft argues they should be off-limits to the U.S. government until Ireland gives the OK.   Apple (AAPL) and 18 other tech rivals, as well as 16 media organizations, including CNN, have filed or said they will file court briefs in support of Microsoft's position.   Microsoft's argument basically boils down to this: Data stored overseas is not subject to U.S. law enforcement. If Uncle Sam wants information that lives in a foreign server farm, it has to go through a legal channel known as a mutual legal assistance treaty.   Related: Microsoft begins accepting Bitcoin   For example, just because Hilton is a company based in the United States, the U.S. government couldn't search a Hilton hotel room in England. Items in that room would be covered by U.K. laws, noted Ed Lazowska, computer science professor at the University of Washington, who spoke during the briefing. (Lazowska's department is sponsored by Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder).   But in August a federal trial judge rejected Microsoft's argument. The judge's reasoning: Since the emails can be instantly transferred to the United States with a click of a button, the search would actually occur here. Microsoft has appealed the decision.   Details about the criminal case have been sealed, but Microsoft hinted that the customers in question are not American. The company noted that it typically houses data in server farms that are close to the customers themselves in order to minimize upload and download lag times.   ""If this were a matter of Americans trying to evade U.S. law, that would be a different question,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief counsel, said Monday. ""Should we tell Europeans that they are now subject to U.S. law? That doesn't seem like the right precedent.""   Related: Microsoft kills off iconic product   Smith acknowledged that Microsoft's bottom line is at stake. The cloud computing business is booming. People and corporations around the world are increasingly storing their data in server farms owned by Microsoft, Google (GOOGL), Apple and others. Customers must believe that their emails are secure.   But Smith also said Microsoft believes it is being principled about the matter. If Ireland were to give the OK, Microsoft would turn over the data without question, he said.   So why haven't U.S. prosecutors just asked Ireland for the emails. Too much red tape, the U.S. government argued. In addition, Ireland is a U.S. ally -- what happens when the servers are in countries with unfriendly governments? "

Microsoft (MSFT) has already argued in a June court filing that prosecutors had no right to execute the warrant because it is outside the country's jurisdiction.   The identity of the customers that the government is after isn't clear, though the case relates to alleged drug trafficking and money laundering.   Allowing the warrant to move forward, Microsoft argued, ""would violate international law and treaties, and reduce the privacy protection of everyone on the planet.""   Verizon (VZ) has also weighed in, submitting a brief in support of Microsoft's argument. The case raises questions about what role jurisdiction and physical borders play when it comes to digital information. The result of the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications for how tech companies deal with law enforcement.   Related: Microsoft begins accepting Bitcoin   Tech companies store customer information at data centers all around the world. Microsoft says its email users' information ""resides on a specific server in the Dublin datacenter"" and ""does not exist in any form inside the United States.""   Prosecutors contend that the distinction isn't meaningful because electronic data is ""readily available"" for access by Microsoft employees in the United States.   ""Imposing the limitations urged by Microsoft would lead to absurd results and severely undercut criminal investigations conducted by U.S. law enforcement,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara wrote in a court filing.   Big tech companies receive thousands of requests for customer data each year from intelligence and traditional law enforcement agencies. Those requests have been under scrutiny in recent months following leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden who revealed vast data grabs encompassing millions of people in the U.S. and foreign countries with no suspected links to terrorism.   ""Over the course of the past year, Microsoft and other U.S. technology companies have faced growing mistrust and concern about their ability to protect the privacy of personal information located outside the United States,"" Microsoft said in its June filing.   Related: Microsoft takes giant loss on Nook   This case is different, however, as it relates to a narrow criminal investigation in which a judge has already approved a warrant.   Companies like Microsoft, Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG) regularly publish ""transparency reports"" detailing the amount and nature of data requests they receive from the government, though they can't provide information on individual cases.   Microsoft says it doesn't consider these requests unless law enforcement officials have valid subpoenas, warrants or court orders. "

For the past several years, owners of London property have watched with delight as the values of their homes have spiked annually well into double digits. With gold, as has been the case for thousands of years, it has provided a tradable commodity which investors have turned to in uncertain times. It's a safe haven, the asset of last resort.   But with quality gold ore becoming increasingly hard to find, a Canadian company has ventured 125 kilometers (78 miles) into the Arctic circle to build Europe's largest gold mine. Otherwise known as a place for tourism and skiing, the town of Kittila, in the Lapland region of Northern Finland, is an unforgiving environment to run a mining operation. Average temperatures in winter usually only reach -23 degrees Fahrenheit.  But that hasn't stopped the mining or the growth of the area. Global demand That growth is possible because global demand for gold is high, said Sean Boyd, president and CEO of Toronto-based  Agnico Eagle Mines, which runs Kittila's gold mine. Read: How you'll manage your money in 2020 ""Demand is continuing to grow in a part of the world that's growing population-wise and is growing from a wealth perspective,"" said Boyd. Recent reports from the gold industry development group World Gold Council (WGC) show that consumer demand in China has skyrocketed, and India and the United States have a big appetite for gold, too. While it may be culturally important to own gold in parts of the world, Boyd also said central banks still feel the need to own it. ""That's not going to go away. Central banks are still buying it. It trades like a currency on most days,"" added Boyd.  Or as a recent WGC report put it: ""With many economic and geopolitical wounds still open, central banks once again sought the protection and diversification of gold."" Shanghai has built a gold exchange over the last dozen or so years, and having just opened it up to international players its goal is to make that the largest physical bullion market in the world; Boyd says ""that's a sign that the market continues to move to the East.""  Read: Bitcoin -- one year on from peak price Digging deep Logistically, however, Boyd says it's necessary to go further afield to find quality ore deposits.  ""The easy stuff's been found now. You look at the industry average, gold grade is a little over one gram per ton, and so the gold reports in minute particles and as a result of that you're having to move much more rock than you used to, to get the same amount of gold,"" said Boyd.  It's a laborious process that uses chemicals to extract tiny particles of gold. The Kittila mine is expected to remain open until at least 2036, as Agnico Eagle has already discovered the gold reserve is in excess of 5 million ounces, much higher than its original estimate of 1.5 million ounces.  In order to achieve this, the company will have to take the mine down at least 900 meters (over half a mile) below the surface.  But one thing is for certain: gold's popularity has not waned. ""I don't think gold's going to go away, I think it still has an important role to play,"" said Boyd. Read: How you'll manage your money in 2020 Read: Bitcoin -- one year on from peak price"

""A gap emerged in the lexicon, as a word was needed to describe this activity, and distinguish it from 'smoking','"" the Oxford press release says. ""The word vape arose to fill this gap, and it has proliferated along with the habit."" Oxford's lexicographers grapple every year with a list of potential winners. Last year, ""selfie"" -- ""a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website"" -- trumped ""bitcoin"" and ""twerk"" to take the honor.  In addition to ""vape"" and ""bae,"" this year's shortlist included: budtender, noun: A person whose job is to serve customers in a cannabis dispensary or shop contactless, adjective: Relating to or involving technologies that allow a smart card, mobile phone etc. to contact wirelessly to an electronic reader, typically in order to make a payment indyref, noun: The referendum on Scottish independence, held in Scotland on September 18, 2014, in which voters were asked to answer yes or no to the question ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" normcore, noun: A trend in which ordinary, unfashionable clothing is worn as a deliberate fashion statement slacktivism, noun, informal: Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g. signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website"

He claims he had nothing to do with the creation of the digital currency, and says Newsweek ""must be held accountable for its reckless reporting.""   Nakamoto is accepting donations via credit card, check, money order or -- of course -- bitcoins.   Bitcoin was created in 2009, but its founder has always been shrouded in secrecy. While its creator was identified as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" the popular assumption was that the name was only a pseudonym.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   That changed following the publication of Newsweek's article, the result of a lengthy investigation and interviews with Nakamoto's family members. But Nakamoto's website says he and his family members were misquoted, and that he was ""victimized by a reckless news organization.""   Newsweek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  This is a modal window.   Nakamoto acknowledges that a number of details in the Newsweek article are correct, including his background as an engineer and the fact that he once worked for a defense contractor. But the basic premise about his role in creating the currency, he says, is completely false.   ""Newsweek's article terrorized both Dorian and his family, all of them private citizens,"" the website says.   But Nakamoto could have a difficult time winning his case, given the extensive free speech protections granted to the press.

Merchants that work with eBay's (EBAY) PayPal can now easily start accepting payments from customers that use Bitcoin (XBT), an independent, government-less currency.   PayPal struck a deal with three Bitcoin payment-processing companies: BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Bitcoin is an Internet-based system of money specifically designed to cut out middlemen, like banks and governments. So, it sounds odd to have Bitcoin processors. But they make it easier for everyday, non-tech-savvy businesses to accept bitcoins -- and immediately convert them to cash.   But why take bitcoins -- which have fluctuated in price from $1,100 and $400 in the last year -- instead of proven government money?   The system offers much lower transaction fees, which cost businesses a huge amount of money. The 2%-3% that shops pay in credit card swiping fees can obliterate their profits.   Consider this PayPal's first -- but not last -- foray into the world of Bitcoin. The company has made clear that its interest in Bitcoin runs more than skin deep.   In the last year, eBay's two top executives -- CEO John Donahoe and former president David Marcus -- have expressed interest in Bitcoin's technology.   Related: Here's why Bitcoin matters   PayPal's senior director of corporate strategy, Scott Ellison, told CNNMoney the company is most intrigued by the potential to harness the technology that lies at the heart of the Bitcoin system, a public ledger called a blockchain. It's a totally new way of thinking about transactions. It keeps records that are decentralized and keeps users semi-anonymous while making their transactions public.   ""We think Bitcoin has tremendous opportunities going forward,"" Ellison said. ""If you really want to understand how a technology works, you need to actually be in that technological space yourself.""   Ellison said the move integrating Bitcoin into PayPal is a continuation of the company's view of itself as ""the original payment disruptors.""

Blockchain.info's popular app was kicked out of Apple's system in February. At that time, Apple turned its back on all Bitcoin-related wallet services.   Although Blockchain.info's 100,000 users on iOS could still use their app, no one else could download it.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   But Apple (AAPL) recently reversed its antagonistic stance toward Bitcoin and has started to allow a few Bitcoin wallet apps to trickle back in. On Saturday, Apple notified Blockchain.info it could return. The British startup republished its app on Monday.   The app should appear in the App Store as soon as Apple's computer servers update their systems.   ""This represents a pivotal change for Bitcoin,"" said Blockchain.info's CEO, Nicholas Cary. ""When Apple banned the last app, they told thousands of developers around the world their time and energy wasn't worth anything. I think this will be a shot in the arm for the whole industry.""  This is a modal window.   Those computer developers instead turned their energy toward Android. Google's (GOOGL) mobile operating system has become a hotbed for Bitcoin-related wallets and trading services. Bitcoin developers have also received millions of dollars of support from venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz.   Cary thinks Apple didn't want to miss out on the opportunity.   Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The tech behemoth's stock hit the highest price in the company's history -- $101.09 -- on Wednesday.   Investors are salivating over demand for the next iPhone and cheering Apple's (AAPL) newfound willingness to spend its cash horde.   Those who follow Apple closely might be wondering how this can be the all-time high price. After all, Apple stock traded over $700 a share in September 2012.   The catch is Apple executed a stock split in June where investors received seven new shares for each share they used to own. Stock splits are a somewhat common move for large companies. It didn't change the value of Apple, but it does make it easier for people to buy the stock at the lower price tag.   Uncharted territory: Taking the stock split into account, Apple closed at a record highs on Tuesday and then did it again on Wednesday. The prior closing high of $100.30 was set on September 19, 2012.   Apple also set a new record for the highest price ever paid for its stock on Wednesday. It traded as high as $101.09, knocking down the prior all-time high of $100.72 from September 21, 2012.   Investors who have stuck with Apple in recent months have been rewarded. Apple's shares have nearly doubled since tumbling as low as $55 in April 2013, crushing rivals like Google (GOOGL).   ""It probably should have never gone as low as it did in the first place. Investors started worrying Apple had lost all momentum,"" said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners who covers Apple.   It's all about the iPhone: Apple is the world's largest company by market cap, and its latest quarterly report from July offers a lot to be happy about.   IPhone sales jumped 13% from the year before to 35.2 million, driven by strong growth in emerging markets like China, Brazil and India.   Investors soured on Apple and CEO Time Cook for awhile, partly due to concerns about the company's ability to innovate without visionary founder Steve Jobs.   Related: Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs. So what though?  This is a modal window.   The need to churn out new products is highlighted by Apple's iPad sales, which shrank in recent quarters.   'Mother load' of upgrades: But the new iPhone 6, which is expected to hit the shelves later this year and feature a larger screen, has the potential to be another game changer.   ISI Group estimates there are a whopping 200 million iPhone users worldwide who want to upgrade to the new model.   ""We call it the mother load of all Apple upgrade cycles,"" said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""There's so much wood behind the arrow that we think it will be a multi-quarter upgrade cycle.""   Related: Apple welcomes back top Bitcoin wallet app   At the same time, there are rumblings that Apple will enter the smartwatch game with an ""iWatch."" But there's little reason to believe the iWatch will be a mega blockbuster like the iPhone or iPad.   ""Unless they are able to tie it in from a health-care perspective in a very unique fashion, this is going to be a niche product. I don't think it's going to move the needle very much,"" said Marshall.   Shareholder friendly: Apple has also pleased investors (especially hedge fund billionaire Carl Icahn) by finally opening up its treasure chest of cash to do stock buybacks and give shareholders dividends.   Related: Apple buffs up radio service with string of acquisitions   ""They continue to buy back a ton of stock, have a nice dividend yield and the company's valuation is not rich,"" said Marshall.   Apple has even shown a willingness to spend on acquisitions. In May, Apple inked a $3 billion deal to buy streaming music service Beats and recently announced a string of smaller deals.

481,481,New York unveils Bitcoin license rules,http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/18/technology/bitcoin-license/index.html,"Jul 18, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Benjamin Lawsky, who leads the state's Department of Financial Services, unveiled a set of draft rules for ""BitLicenses"" on Thursday. They apply for all virtual currencies.   If they stick, Bitcoin will be one step closer to a legitimate form of money -- and a giant leap away from the shady, semi-anonymous, free-for-all that currently defines the independent digital currency.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   As part of the proposed new rules, Bitcoin trading businesses must pass background checks, know all their customers, be open to regulator inspection at any time and keep 100% of account reserves on hand.   ""We have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity -- without stifling beneficial innovation,"" Lawsky said in a statement. ""Setting up common sense rules of the road is vital to the long-term future of the virtual currency industry, as well as the safety and soundness of customer assets.""   The rules don't clamp down on average users who spend this computerized money online or at tech-savvy bars and barbershops. Instead, they're strict requirements on the bank-like businesses that buy, sell and store bitcoins. You can read the full proposal here.   Bitcoin exchanges must now keep detailed records on all their customers. It's an attempt to clamp down on black market uses for Bitcoin, such as money laundering and buying illegal goods.   Currently, the backbone of the Bitcoin system logs all transactions, but it only lists peoples' anonymous digital wallets. By forcing exchanges to log everyone who acquires a Bitcoin, the system is suddenly traceable to actual people.   The tough part? Actually acquiring a BitLicense to operate.   Financial regulators will carefully screen anyone running a virtual currency business. Regulators will check their criminal background, professional qualifications and judge whether they're fit to manage money. If anything goes sour, regulators can yank a license.   Related: 'I lost money with Mt.Gox'   It's right in line with what Lawsky told CNNMoney in an interview in April. He explained then that his biggest fear is a repeat of what happened in Tokyo, when the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, went bankrupt and lost close to $400 million in users' accounts.   ""What I would never want to see is... that there was something we missed and an exchange collapsed,"" Lawsky said at the time. ""We're going to work very hard on our blind spots so we put protections in place -- that may seem overly conservative to some -- to make sure we don't have a collapse.""   But as Lawsky said then, he doesn't want rules ""so burdensome or unwieldy that the technology can't develop.""  This is a modal window.   The rules also show Lawsky understands how Bitcoin works. Exchanges must secure exactly the number of bitcoins they owe customers. That means no modern banking fractional reserve of funds -- a central tenet of the Bitcoin philosophy.   The public has 45 days to comment on the proposed rules. The question now is whether the Bitcoin community will embrace it.   Related: Where is Bitcoin legal?   Nick Spanos is the cofounder of the NYC Bitcoin Center, which serves as a community meeting place where people can learn about it and do in-person trades. It also aims to be the New York Stock Exchange of bitcoins.   Spanos welcomes regulation but said younger entrepreneurs in his circles think the rules are too costly and will crush them.   ""I just saw the gleam in their eye get put out last night,"" he said. ""They're chasing away business from New York. They can just go to New Jersey.""   Then again, Spanos said the rules serve to give the Bitcoin space much-needed accountability.   ""If you're going to take people's money and hold it as a third party, you should be scrutinized,"" Spanos said.   Jose Pagliery is also the author of Bitcoin - And the Future of Money, available in bookstores on Sept. 1 (Triumph Books, Chicago). "

But most of us would find it difficult to imagine actually using this crypto-currency or even picturing what it looks like.  In fact, only a handful of venues in bustling London actually accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.  That could be changing though, as the UK's first Bitcoin ATM machine arrived earlier this year at The Old Shoreditch Station café and bar in modish East London.  CNN set out to find out more about the machine which allows customers to buy coffees and cakes in the café.  Jaguarshoes Collective founder and café owner Nick Letchford was already using Bitcoin as a form of currency when he decided to install the machine after meeting a fellow enthusiast who pitched the idea to him.  ""I am quite a sci-fi enthusiast and well, immediately I was captivated by the idea of it. I saw it as very much the way forward,"" Letchford told CNN's Nina Dos Santos, at the café in London. ""I mean, a virtual currency or a digital currency is definitely the way the future of finance is headed,"" he said.  The owner of the machine, Joel Raziel, said he had the idea to install a machine in Letchford's café after seeing one at a convention several months ago.  ""I was so amazed by the machine. I thought someone might bring one to the UK,"" said Raziel.  ""The reason I really like Bitcoin is our financial system is very limited. We can send music, we can send messages, we can send any type of information, the only thing we can't send is money without having to go through banks,"" Raziel told Dos Santos.  If it sounds too much like a movement of the anti-establishment, Raziel is quite sure it's grown into something much greater than that.  ""It's about freedom, it's not about trying to go against something, it's just about trying to make the world a financial place we'd like to operate in,"" he explained.  So how does it work?  ""We can put a 5 pound note into the Bitcoin ATM and it will give you a value of Bitcoin that exchanges to that value of 5 pounds,"" explained Letchford.  Letchford said he trades in thousandths of a Bitcoin, meaning it is perfectly acceptable to pay for coffees by paying 0.001 of a Bitcoin. Each milli-Bitcoin is a thousandth of a Bitcoin.  ""It's a very simple process,"" said Raziel, who explained that after pressing the start button, the consumer then scans a QR code on their phone which is linked to their   Bitcoin wallet online. The final step is to simply insert money into the note acceptor. While only about 1-2 per cent of Letchford's customers currently buy with Bitcoin, he still sees this as the way forward.  Raziel couldn't agree more. ""We now have online banking, we now have chip and pin, we pay with wire transfers over the internet. In fact, very few people are using cash these days,"" says Raziel.  ""Bitcoin is just a smarter step into empowering ourselves to control this digital money,"" he said. "

Related story: Amazon unveils 3-D Fire Phone   Gillett said he includes his World of Warcraft achievements on his resume, because it's not just about role-playing games.

As a guild master, his current duties and responsibilities include organizing dungeon raids and managing the group's virtual bank. And he has a knack for recruiting key talent. Think mages and warlocks.   Those skills transferred to his position as Starbucks' CIO, Gillett says. In that role, he was tasked with saving the company's suffering technology assets. Cash registers were outdated. Computers were scarce. Customer sales were down.

The goal was to expose them to a business model that capitalizes on gaming.  This is a modal window.   Gillett got approval to start a new business unit, Digital Ventures. The cross between IT and marketing focused solely on improving Starbucks' interaction with customers' devices, like smartphones and laptops.   The result: The company ""gamified"" the Starbucks experience.

487,487,Inside Virgin Galactic's newest passenger spaceship,http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/13/tech/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-update/index.html,"Jun 13, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"When I first poked my head inside Virgin Galactic's newest spaceship, I felt a little like I was getting a front-row seat to space history.  The company, led by billionaire Richard Branson, allowed CNN unprecedented access to a ""SpaceShipTwo, Serial Two"" spacecraft which was being carefully assembled by workers at a secure facility in the high desert north of Los Angeles.  This invention spun from carbon fiber and imagination is designed to fly tourists some 60 miles high to the edge of space. In 2008, Branson predicted the company would be launching paying passengers by 2010. Obviously that hasn't happened yet. Meanwhile, more than 700 people -- reportedly including astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher -- are awaiting to gain official status as Space Cowboys. The latest word: Virgin Galactic says it's on track to begin commercial service by the end of this year.  ""Rome wasn't built in a day,"" Branson tweeted in January. The spaceship I boarded isn't expected to fly until 2015. I was asked not to take photos or video. From the inside, it looks bigger than you'd expect after seeing its 60-foot-long exterior. For some reason I expected more machinery during assembly. Standing inside the cabin's shell, I found four technicians working away with precision and TLC.  There were no furnishings installed yet, so I tried to imagine which of the six seats in the spacecraft would be my choice --  if I could afford a $250,000 ticket.  The cabin is dotted with so many windows it blew me away -- a side window and a ceiling window for every passenger. I imagined myself in the front row. Right side. Stepping carefully to the window, I remembered what space travelers have said about the power of seeing the awe-inspiring curvature of the Earth and what a life-changing experience that is. I was sort of projecting that as I stood inside the spaceship. Here's how Virgin Galactic's space tours are supposed to work: Six passengers and two pilots will board a SpaceShipTwo -- a combination rocket and glider. The ship is attached to a powerful airplane, called a WhiteKnightTwo. That plane flies the rocket/gilder up to about 50,000 feet.  Then the real fun starts.  The pilots separate the spacecraft from the plane. They ignite the spacecraft's rocket engine, creating G-forces that pin passengers back in their seats, according to Virgin Galactic. They'll experience ""eye-watering acceleration"" to nearly 2,500 mph, more than three times the speed of sound.  As the ship reaches higher and higher, the cobalt blue sky turns to black. Then: engines off.  Silence. Passengers will be allowed out of their seats -- to feel that weightlessness we've all heard so much about. It will be interesting to learn what really happens during the six minutes of weightlessness that Virgin Galactic says passengers will get on each flight. Imagine all six passengers inside this cabin as they're dying to get that space-faring-selfie they can post online for the rest of their lives. I'm wondering: What are the rules in space to get those photos? How is that going to work? Is everyone going to be bumping into each other while they're floating around the cabin? There were four workers in the ship's cabin with me, and I could imagine us all bumping into each other -- accidentally throwing an elbow while we tried to maintain balance and control in zero-G. After the weightless portion of the flight -- if all goes according to plan -- passengers will strap themselves back into their seats before the spacecraft yields to the forces of gravity and begins its glide downward toward sweet Mother Earth. Related: What does a Virgin Galactic ticket get you? Perhaps the real, lasting value of this experience will be what passengers bring back with them. Will it change the way they live here on Earth? Virgin Galactic says its primary goal isn't about pushing the boundaries of space exploration. It's about offering people a chance to gain a new perspective on the world -- literally and figuratively. Will seeing the beauty of the planet shift the way passengers interact with the environment? Will it trigger people to embrace more environmentally sustainable lifestyles and technologies? Whatever the case, the Virgin Galactic website promises: ""Life will never quite be the same again."" As anticipation builds towards the maiden passenger flight, here are seven things about the program you may not know: 1. Can we call them astronauts?  Virgin Galactic refers to its space tourists as ""passenger astronauts."" But Buzz Aldrin doesn't like it. ""I don't think they should be called astronauts,"" Aldrin told CNN in 2010. ""That term was created by the U.S. military. My suggestions would be star-traveler or starflyer."" Aldrin knows from astronauts. Let's not forget he was the the second astronaut to walk on the moon.  2. Chinese nationals are banned from flights U.S. anti-espionage laws require Virgin Galactic to ban Chinese nationals from its flights, according to the South China Morning Post. Why? Because rocket engines on the Virgin Galactic vessels reportedly are considered military-grade technology under U.S. arms trafficking laws established during the Cold War. The legislation was designed to prevent certain foreign powers, such as China, from getting hold of U.S. military tech secrets. 3. Virgin Galactic accepts Bitcoin For the unaware: Bitcoin is an experimental form of money that exists only online. It's not regulated by any central authorty. About 12 million Bitcoins have entered circulation. Branson told CNNMoney last January that a ""future astronaut, a female flight attendant from Hawaii, has already purchased her Virgin Galactic ticket using Bitcoins."" 4. Look who's hitching a ride: NASA As everyone knows, NASA figured out how to go to the moon long ago. Now, after the death of the shuttle program, the legendary space agency is relying on others for transportation. Virgin Galactic has agreed to carry a dozen NASA technology experiments on its first commercial research flight. 5. Should Virgin Galactic partner with Google?

488,488,Feds to auction $17.4 million in bitcoin from Silk Road,http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/12/technology/security/silk-road-bitcoin-auction/index.html,"Jun 13, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The digital currency -- about $17.4 million of it, according to the currency converter Preev.com -- was seized from Silk Road, an online black market that authorities say had nearly 1 million users.   Silk Road operated in the largely anonymous dark corners of the Internet and specialized in contraband of all varieties, including drugs and illegal weapons.   The FBI shuttered the site in October and seized the nearly 30,000 bitcoins that will soon be auctioned.   Agents also arrested Ross William Ulbricht, who the feds say owned and managed the site using the monicker Dread Pirate Roberts. They confiscated bitcoins he held and charged him with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering charges, according to the government.   Related: The Deep Web you don't know about   The auction of the bitcoins seized from Silk Road will be held next week. It won't be for paupers.   Federal Marshals said the bitcoins will be auctioned in blocks of about 3,000 -- worth $1.8 million, according to the Marshals and the conversion site Preev.   Bidders must preregister by Monday and wire the Marshals a refundable $200,000 deposit. Bids may be submitted in dollars between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday, June 27.   Specifically excluded from the auction are bidders ""acting on behalf of or in concert"" with Ulbricht or Silk Road.   Bitcoin has had a rocky year of its own. A series of thefts -- including one that bankrupted Mt.Gox, the most popular Bitcoin exchange -- have shaken confidence in the currency's security. "
489,489,Bitcoin ATMs coming to the U.S.,http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/18/tech/innovation/bitcoin-atms/index.html,"Feb 18, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Bitcoin, the emerging if still somewhat mysterious digital currency, may be coming soon to a high-tech ATM near you. Kiosks that allow people to buy the virtual coins, or exchange them for cash, will be installed within the next month or so in Seattle and Austin, Texas, according to Robocoin, the Las Vegas-based company that makes the machines. They will be the first such ATMs in the United States. Robocoin has installed machines in Vancouver, British Columbia, with more in Canada, Hong Kong, Europe and Asia in the works. The emergence of public ATMs, the company says, is a step toward making Bitcoin, a currency that's not backed by a government or bank and has no physical assets to prop up its value, a more comfortable buy for mainstream users outside the Webcentric circles where it currently thrives. ""We think it's a huge breakthrough when it comes to bringing accessibility to the consumers,"" Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley said. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in value. Currently, a single Bitcoin is worth about $636. That value was as high as $1,000 in December as investors began leaping into the currency. Some traditional businesses, including online retailer Overstock.com, some Subway sandwich shops and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, have begun accepting Bitcoin. But the anonymous nature of the currency also has linked it with less reputable outlets. Bitcoin and other digital ""cryptocurrencies"" have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs, weapons and other illegal merchandise. Last week, the anonymous owners of black-market website Silk Road announced that hackers had stolen $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin. In separate incidents, several online Bitcoin exchanges have been taken down by hackers who exploited a flaw to create fake transactions. Kelley wants his company's machines to help the currency shed its shadier associations, even if that means alienating some supporters who like the mostly anonymous nature of Bitcoin exchanges. ""We're trying to move Bitcoin, put it in the mainstream, bring it to the masses,"" he said. ""To do that, some things have to go by the wayside, and one of them is anonymity."" To create a Robocoin account, a user enters their mobile phone number at one of the kiosks. The machine sends a code to that phone and, after the user enters the code, they are asked to scan the palm of their hand. ""Your phone is your user ID and your palm is your password,"" Kelly said. The user is then asked to insert a driver's license or other government-issued ID, further personalizing their account as well as providing Robocoin an opportunity to verify the user's name against government watch lists for terrorists or others who may not legally do business in the machine's home country. Then, the user takes a photo at the kiosk, which must be verified as a match with the picture on their ID card. Once their account is verified, a process Kelley said takes two to five minutes, they are free to buy Bitcoins at the kiosk. Customers may either transfer them to an account, using a private code the machine dispenses, or use a smartphone app to store them on their phone. Robocoin sells the machines for $20,000. Owners make money by charging a small transaction fee to use them, Kelley said."
490,490,Managing your online identity in the digital shopping age,http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/03/business/managing-your-online-identity/index.html,"Jun 3, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"The convergence of our financial lives and online personas is happening fast.  From fulfilling our most basic household purchases on Amazon to buying a car or even a new home online, we are increasingly completing higher value or sensitive transactions online or with our mobile phones. And with the growth in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin or universal payment protocols like Ripple, this is only going to accelerate as we create a value web closely mirroring today's information web.  This desire to do more online has also caused a corresponding growth in fraud and personal risk. Take for example one recent victim of identity fraud who lost  nearly $10,000 after fraudulent PayPal accounts were used to buy his bitcoins off eBay. Or consider that most businesses consider fraud-related losses of 5-8% as an accepted cost of doing business online. A lack of trust, control and traceability are at the root of this fraud with more than $3.5 trillion lost each year to financial crimes globally. In the U.S. alone, identity theft results in more than $21 billion in annual losses affecting over 12 million consumers. And in the United Kingdom, there is one instance of fraud or identity related theft every two minutes. That's at least one more victim by the time you finish reading this article.  Unfortunately, as we continue to move more of our spending online and even adopt new virtual currencies, these rates of fraud and the number of fraudsters will only increase. So how do we combat this growing crisis? We must build a layer of trust throughout the Internet that restores the confidence, protection and control consumers need and deserve.  This is an issue being addressed by many governments and industry bodies such as NSTIC in the U.S., the UK ID Assurance Program and Trust in Digital Life in Europe.  As they seek a successful standard and invest in new technologies, they must find a way to quickly and easily prove real identities at all times without putting consumer information at risk. Consumers must also be confident in the system without being asked to share too much in order to meet this high standard of trust.  It should be obvious that this goes beyond just filling in your name, date of birth and address. The Internet has shifted from its early origins in anonymity to an environment now filled with our personal information via our social accounts or more drastic occurrences like the recent breaches at Target, LinkedIn and hundreds of others.  This basic information is now readily available online and no longer provides a degree of security or verification. So we cannot reverse this course and suddenly eliminate this personal information -- nor would we want to -- but we can protect it.  I believe the best way to build a better identity system is to separate our identity from our personal information online. This will protect consumers from impersonation and account takeover. Consumers need a single, trusted identity that includes and gives them control over their own personal information but is verified separately and protected behind multiple layers of security. It is the equivalent of checking someone's passport or ID in the physical world -- but happens purely online and in just seconds.  This single, trusted identity can then be used easily and conveniently however they choose, but without sharing additional information or exposing them to fraud. By using a consumer-driven identity, we can both empower individuals and enable businesses.  The result will be more and greater online engagement and transactions in healthcare, banking, investing, and social interactions without the fraud or dropout rates that plague much of the industry today.  We are on the verge of solving today's online identity crisis, and the result will make significant progress towards saving the world $3.5 trillion in fraud every year. The first step is for business and industry to embrace the need and deploy identity requirements. With new solutions available in the marketplace, a growing awareness amongst consumers, and willingness on the part of national governments, the answer is within our grasp. "

The makers of a game called Weed Firm says Apple removed the app from the iTunes App Store this week after hitting No. 1 on the store's download charts.   In Weed Firm, players walk in the shoes of pot dealer Ted Growing through his ""vicious and lawless career,"" growing marijuana plants and selling pot while dodging ""crooked cops"" and ""dangerous gangsters."" You may even be tasked with paying a stripper to give a lap dance.   Apple (AAPL) did not respond to a request for comment about why the game was removed.   Related: Apple drops top Bitcoin app from marketplace   Developer Manitoba Games said it was also left in the dark about the game's removal.   ""We guess the problem was that the game was just too good and got to number one in all categories,"" the company said in a statement.   Apple hasn't yanked other weed-related apps from its store. Weed Maps allows you to find medical marijuana dispensaries near you. And a game called Weed Tycoon lets players set up virtual pot shops, set prices for different strains, and buy farms to grow your weed.   ""There are certainly a great number of weed based apps still available, as well as games promoting other so-called 'illegal activities' such as shooting people, crashing cars and throwing birds at buildings,"" Manitoba Games said.  This is a modal window.   While Weed Firm's character is leading a ""lawless"" career, it's perfectly legal to buy and sell pot in the state of Colorado, though sellers must be licensed by the state and adhere to strict guidelines that Ted Growing may not be used to. The company says in the opening credits that the game is a work of fiction and is not a manual on how to grow or deal weed.   Still, the legality of marijuana remains murky. As of June 1, Colorado and Washington are the only states where you can legally buy recreational marijuana and it remains illegal under federal law.   Manitoba Games said it is planning to get Weed Firm back in the Apple store after making some changes. It was also taken down from the Google (GOOGL) Play store, but the company said that was due to a problem with the game's publisher and not with Google. It is expected to return after finding a new publisher. "

Dialing Services runs the website gopcalls.com, which says it's worked with Republican candidates and conservative causes ""for over two decades."" The site claims to have provided ""calling solutions"" for political candidates including Mitt Romney, Tom Tancredo and George W. Bush.   Related: Bitcoin approved for political contributions   The company received its warning from the FCC last year after allegedly placing more than 4.7 million robocalls to mobile phones during the 2012 election cycle. It's illegal to place robocalls to cell phones except in limited circumstances: when the calls are made for emergency purposes, or when they're made with the prior consent of the recipient.   FCC enforcement chief Travis LeBlanc said the commission is ""committed to protecting consumers from harassing, intrusive, and unwanted robocalls to cell phones, smart phones, and other mobile devices.""   Reached by phone Thursday, Dialing Services owner Chris Kolker said he hadn't heard about the fine and needed to consult with his attorney. "

The decision means that political groups or candidates can accept Bitcoin if they abide by the same guidelines that the political group Make Your Laws set forth when it asked for the commission's approval. Bitcoin political contributions would be clearly identified and limited.   Proponents say it's a sign of increased acceptance of the upstart currency, as more businesses and individuals are starting to embrace Bitcoin payments as an alternative to credit cards.

""It's probably good for the Bitcoin economy as well.""   Sai is his full legal name, and his Make Your Laws is a nonpartisan group. Its website says its aim is to use technology to give individuals a louder voice in elections and democracy.   The decision was monitored by the Bitcoin Foundation, a lobbying group that also asked the commission to approve the use of Bitcoin for political fundraising.   Related: Bitcoin players knock on Washington doors   The decision is a turnaround from last fall, when the election commission deadlocked on a similar request.   With no official laws barring the use of Bitcoin in elections, a handful of candidates and political groups have said they're already accepting Bitcoin. They can continue to do so, but they risk getting reviewed and possibly penalized by the elections panel if they go beyond the election commission's Thursday decision.   Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for governor in that state, said last month he'd accept donations in Bitcoin. The Libertarian Party also collects between $10,000 and $20,000 in Bitcoin each year. It's a small percentage of the $1 million it raises annually, according to Libertarian Party Executive Director Wes Benedict.   Related: What is Bitcoin   The developments come as Bitcoin is under increased scrutiny. Last month, Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers that virtual currencies pose a challenge for law enforcement agencies, because they can be used to hide illegal activity.

What we are witnessing is nothing less than a complete reappraisal of the fundamental principles that underpin business -- and that are set to transform the future.  Here are five ways money will change in the future. The four 'P' economic model Seismic events, including technological innovation, lead to radical behavior shifts -- but our belief systems are just as influential.  At present, we are witnessing a ""me culture"" shifting towards a ""we"" mindset of collaboration -- exemplified by micro banking and crowd funding -- with mobile technology being the great enabler. This has impacted commercial structures across the world and leaders now look to new economic models, motivated not only by P for profit, but also P for People, Planet and Purpose; welcome to a reality where a 4P bottom line will become the norm.  New alternative currencies Exponential growth in technologies is inspiring disruptive business models in most sectors, and finance is no exception.  Already challenged by declining trust, traditional ""bricks and mortar"" monetary institutions are now joined by a new wave of alternative and open-source ways of managing money. The Bitcoin is an example of digital technology in action -- a global, decentralized currency without physical borders, national sovereignty or middlemen -- and similar P2P (person to person) models will undoubtedly increase in the future. Equally interesting is the rise of local currencies, such as the Brixton and Bristol pounds in the UK, created to encourage trade and strengthen both local community and economy -- both operate largely via mobile.   Financial evolution and social mobility Trading methods for goods and services are constantly evolving -- from gold to coins to paper to credit cards and now mobile-enabled transactions. Within western economies, uptake of mobile payment technology has been slow, in part because of consumer trust on security/fraud issues, but also barriers to entry in this market. Inspiration on where the future is unfolding is to be found in Africa -- where a substantial unbanked population and a growing mobile youth present enormous potential for financial services innovation and financial inclusion. In several African countries, mobile payments have replaced credit cards and mobile services like Esoko now operates in over 15 nations to convey market data and ensure fair commodity trading among farmers.  Now the undisputed leader in mobile money, Africa accounted for 15 of the top 20 countries globally in 2013, but in India this trend is quickening with MoneyOnMobile and Easypaisa gaining market influence.  Seven ways mobile phones have changed lives in Africa Collaborative networks and the global brain  Today's mobile networks are like neurons in a massive global brain, which will continue to connect us while chipping away at the power base of conventional financial institutions. Smartphone technologies are also major empowerment tools for two of the 4Ps -- People and Planet. Beyond digital platforms for the transfer of money, goods and services, smartphones are an enabler of education, information, work, health, social participation and more sustainable solutions. It has been predicted, by Ericsson in 2009, that as many as 50 billion devices will be connected to The Internet of Things by 2020. In effect, this ""global brain"" has potential to become a platform for navigating a better life across classes and conventional geographical borders. In Asia, the momentum of innovation is inspiring radical new solutions to drive inclusiveness and, ultimately, economic growth.  Last year, Seoul became the world's first official sharing economy and, with 60% of South Koreans owning a smartphone, the city government is championing mobile-enabled collaborations involving everything from startup support to workspace sharing. The best deals in tech Transparent financial ecosystem  Blurring of online and offline commerce has seen a greater demand for seamlessness, causing most sectors to adopt new multiple channels for financial transactions in order to stay competitive. We are also witnessing ""betapreneurship"" -- in which products or services are tested and developed through interaction with customers -- emerging across the business spectrum, and this is in line with 4P thinking and enhanced by mobile platforms. A new generation of global citizens that wants easy, barrier-free access to money is pioneering and supporting these commerce models.  But support is not restricted to Millennials. Edelman found that 84% of people believe business can pursue both its own interests and that of society.  The networked society offers transparency and, when everyone and everything that can benefit is connected to the Internet, business must evolve to match a new global mindset. In short, mobile money may become our springboard to achieving a more inclusive and equitable society. 'Funny money' has officially entered the real world "
495,495,"Reddit, Dogecoin support NASCAR racer at Talladega",http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/web/nascar-dogecoin-talladega/index.html,"Apr 24, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"What do you get when you combine a cryptocurrency, 752 left turns and a 16-year-old Reddit user? For NASCAR Sprint Cup driver Josh Wise, it all adds up to sponsorship for one of the most exciting races of the year and a new bunch of tech-savvy fans. The story begins with a teenage racing fan from Niles, Illinois. Reddit user Denis Pavel was watching some of the early races in the 2014 NASCAR season and noticed a black Ford Fusion with no sponsorship and a driver ""racing the wheels off the car."" Pavel was also a member of the subreddit /r/NASCAR and had seen the online community rally behind other drivers and the various fundraising and other campaigns they endorsed. His idea was grander. The teenager wanted to get the No. 98 car sponsored at one of the fastest tracks on the circuit: the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Drivers race side-by-side on the 2.66-mile track, sometimes reaching speeds of more than 200 mph. Enter the cryptocurrency. Introduced in late 2013 and named for a silly Internet meme, Dogecoin is digital currency like Bitcoin -- basically cash for the Internet. Money can be transferred nearly anywhere in the world for less than a penny per transaction and has been used prominently for charitable and notable causes. Related: Man selling home for $135,000 in Dogecoins ""I knew that Dogecoin had done some significant fundraisers, like sending the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics,"" Pavel said. ""I was thinking what kind of response I would get if I did ask the (Reddit) community about sponsoring a Sprint Cup car. They were all with it."" Armed with support, Pavel reached out to the owner of the No. 98 car, Phil Parsons, through Twitter. After exchanging telephone numbers, Pavel told Parsons about the plan to sponsor the car and how it was going to happen. ""I asked if he knew about Reddit or Dogecoin. He said no,"" Pavel said. ""He told me the pricing of a full wrap and just a logo on the quarter panel. I don't know if he thought I was pulling his leg."" Parsons told Pavel that a full wrap, meaning main sponsorship all over the car, would cost $50,000. Pavel felt confident the /r/NASCAR community would get there with the help of Dogecoin. Within a week, the community raised more than $55,000, or 67 million Dogecoins, to sponsor the car and put the Dogecoin Ford Fusion in the Aaron's 499 race in May.  Wise, who admits he had not been very active on the Internet, has been pumped up by the online support. ""The more we've walked through this (fundraising effort), it has really been special to us,"" Wise said. ""People are noticing our effort. We're a tiny little team with 7 or 8 employees. The amount of support we're getting from the Reddit community ... we're just trying to do the best job we can."" For his part, Wise promoted the effort on Twitter and also did an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on /r/dogecoin. He even claimed the Reddit user name ""dogedriver"" to keep the momentum going. Ben Doernberg, a board member at the Dogecoin Foundation, said that raising the money for the sponsorship was done in record time. Beyond sports ventures, Dogecoin has raised money to build clean water wells in Kenya and for a charity that trains service animals to work with children with autism and other disabilities. ""We are all about fun and goofiness,"" Doernberg said. ""At the same time, we want to make sure that digital currency is really giving back to the world. We do feel like this is a technology that can make the world a better place, and we want to put that into practice by doing fundraisers."" Doernberg said the NASCAR sponsorship is one of the largest fundraisers they've done to date.  Since the money was raised on the Internet, it was only fair that the color scheme of the car be chosen there as well. A poll posted on /r/dogecoin asked users to choose between gold, silver or black as the main color. Black garnered more than 57% of the vote, and the design was finalized.  Reddit users also helped develop the fire suits that will be worn by the team on race day. Wise said users asked him during his AMA what he wanted the design to look like. He told them just have fun with it. ""I wasn't going to hold them back on anything they wanted,"" he said. ""It actually a little more conservative than I probably expected -- something wild and off the wall, but they kept it pretty tame, actually."" The car and suits prominently feature the Shiba Inu dog face commonly associated with the ""doge"" Internet meme, along with a rocket ship and the phrase ""To the Moon,"" commonly used for the popularity of Dogecoin.  But Wise and Parsons weren't done with Dogecoin after just one race. The Sprint Cup Series All-Star race at the Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 17 pits the previous year's race winners and two top qualifiers in a winner-take-all race.  One driver voted in by the fans gets to participate as well. Wise and Parsons said they would race the Dogecoin car if Reddit users vote Wise into the race. The Dogecoin car is also likely to be made into a die-cast 1:24 scale car as part of a NASCAR deal with Lionel Racing Collectibles. Fans of the NASCAR '14 video game will also get the chance to race the Dogecoin car for themselves when it is added in an upcoming DLC pack. ""As the company behind the NASCAR video games and mobile games, we love to see more technology-oriented partners getting involved in NASCAR,"" said Ed Martin, executive vice president of Eutechnyx, developer of the video game. ""I think it will bring NASCAR to the attention of a lot of people that haven't been exposed before."" For Pavel, who has loved NASCAR racing all his life, the video game might be the closest he gets to his dream. ""I want to get into NASCAR and want to head to my local tracks like Rockford Speedway. I hopefully one day want to get into a real race car,"" he said. For now, Pavel will cheer on the No. 98 Dogecar and Josh Wise at Talladega on May 4. "

It's all part of a push to shape how Washington ultimately regulates the independent, digital money that is growing in popularity.   ""The most important thing we're doing is explaining how Bitcoin works,"" said Jim Harper, a lobbyist who was hired recently as counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization that represents Bitcoin companies and investors. Harper, who has lobbied for PayPal and VeriSign, is paid in bitcoin.   The timing is ripe.   Just two weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service issued a rule to tax bitcoin as property. The Federal Election Commission is also expected in the next several weeks to decide whether people can contribute to political campaigns using bitcoin. Another federal agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to rule whether Bitcoin is a traded commodity, like gold or interest rates.   All of this comes as Bitcoin is under increased scrutiny. On Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder told lawmakers during a Congressional testimony that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies pose a challenge for law enforcement agencies, because they can be used to conceal illegal activity.   ""A lot of different government officials and federal agencies are trying to wrap their mind around Bitcoin,"" said Harper, the lobbyist.   Those in the Bitcoin world certainly don't want to be caught by surprise with any new federal rules.   Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Boston-based Circle Internet Financial, a Bitcoin exchange startup, has been making frequent trips to Washington meeting with regulators at the U.S. Treasury and lawmakers on Capitol Hill to talk about the virtual money.   He said he ""welcomed the decision"" by the IRS to tax bitcoin as property as opposed to a currency, because it added a new layer of certainty for companies like his.   The move to beef up the industry's voice in Washington began late last fall, when Sen. Thomas Carper held a hearing on Bitcoin and asked agencies to give Bitcoin companies a clear regulatory road map.   Any new technology, or industry would be smart to educate Washington, said Michael Beckerman, CEO of The Internet Association, a trade group for digital companies like Facebook and Google.   ""The consequences if you don't (engage in the process) can be dire. Decisions made on the Hill and by regulators can make or break any industry,"" Beckerman said.   Related: Where is Bitcon legal?   Companies dealing in bitcoin have been in informal talks with officials at the federal commodities regulatory agency, says CFTC spokesman Steven Adamske. And the BitCoin Foundation and Atlanta-based BitPay, a digital payments processor, have written letters to the election commission urging the regulator to allow bitcoin for payments in political campaigns.   Bitcoin proponents have reason to be concerned about Washington getting too involved. It could threaten users' anonymity, a key characteristic of the currency.   Bitcoin is used to buy merchandise anonymously. Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular with small businesses because there are no credit card fees.   However, the virtual currency has run into a litany of problems in the last six months.   In October, the FBI shut down Silk Road, the biggest online black market used to market illegal drugs and other items, which used bitcoin for transactions.   Authorities also arrested Charles Shrem, a co-founder and chief executive of a popular bitcoin exchange BitInstant. Shrem was on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.   And in February, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, Mt.Gox, filed for bankruptcy.

499,499,Opinion: Exchanges are like casinos where certain players can see your cards,http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/07/business/opinion-van-dam-high-frequency-trading/index.html,"Apr 7, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"When a fake Twitter message from the Associated Press issued reports of two explosions at the White House last April, the Dow lost 140 points and S&P futures dropped 20 points.  Over $10 billion traded before recovering within a few minutes, when it became clear that the report was not genuine.  It later turned out that the AP Twitter account had been hacked. The previous day Google had experienced a flash crash, dropping $20 in split of a second, before making it back within the next second.  This is now almost a daily occurrence. Most of these events don't even make the newspapers -- only specialist sites record them.  Our global exchanges have changed into Bitcoin platforms. The main culprits: the so-called high frequency trading firms with their superior system technology.  Computers with the ability to react to news faster than humans are a sign of the times. They are hard to fight.  It is not a riskless strategy so I can accept it is here to stay.  However, there are certain types of strategy that only computers can execute that I am extremely worried about.  One of these is based on detecting real, genuine orders in the market -- be they from pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds or retail investors. A typical institutional order would be to buy a stock at the average price for the day. Very soon after this order is put into the market it will be detected by the machines.  Normally even the broker who puts the order in can be identified. The HFT computers will then spend the whole day buying ahead of this order, selling out during the day at an artificially inflated price, with the HFT pocketing the difference.  The same holds true for small orders. The HFT shows some minimal size on the bid or offer and if they catch a genuine order they 'go with the flow' and trade ahead of it, once again forcing the real buyer to pay more than they otherwise would have done.  I notice this myself every time I trade on the exchange -- as soon as I place an order, the price suddenly runs away from me.  Many different HFTs are doing this over thousands of stocks every single day, thereby creating a giant multi-billion dollar front running industry.  The bottom line is that computers have taken control of our exchanges. This billion dollar industry is very well equipped and often uses physical locations next to the exchange with dedicated pipes. This allows them to receive and send stock quotes before the general market.  They sometimes send so many quotes that the exchange feed slows down because of their 'quote stuffing'. There is plenty of evidence that the price we see on our screens is not the same price that is seen by the high frequency trading firms.  We are now trading in the dark, a tragedy in an era where we are all supposed to have the same access.  To me it is clear that too many of the price moves we experience are no longer determined by fundamentals or technicals, or by phenomena such as fear and greed, or even irrational exuberance; they are based on the unpredictable consequences of computers acting with no controls.    The main reason that this has not been stopped so far is because deregulation has allowed many new, privately owned exchanges to open, which are all fighting for business.  HFTs are the biggest players in town, often with over 50% of the volume. No exchange can afford to upset them. In fact, many exchanges pay rebates to attract them.  The HFT lobby will tell you that academic research shows that they provide liquidity and dampen volatility. I believe the opposite -- they remove liquidity when it is needed and increase volatility when it suits them. They represent a tax on all of us.  I was brought up to believe that the stock exchange allocates capital from investors to companies, and is the place to buy and sell stocks based on fundamentals. If we continue to treat our exchanges as casinos, where certain players can see the cards held by others, then we should not be surprised that we are gambling away the future of our market-based economy.

500,500,Why anonymous social networks are scary,http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/02/tech/social-media/secret-apps-business-insider/index.html,"Apr 3, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"In late 2007, a social network called Juicy Campus started going viral at a handful of colleges. But unlike Facebook, which saw a similar buzz three years earlier as a fast-spreading social network conquering one university after another, Juicy Campus encouraged its users to talk about each other, not themselves. Instead of posting party photos and calls for homework help, Juicy Campus was a social network designed to spread gossip about your peers. And to get the best gossip, Juicy Campus let its users post anonymously. You can imagine where that went. After posts of students' sexual exploits and even personal threats began to spread across Juicy Campus, some colleges attempted to block their servers from accessing the site. Fortunately, Juicy Campus didn't last long and was dead by early 2009 because it couldn't generate enough advertising revenue to stay afloat. Today, there's a new resurgence in anonymous social networks and messaging apps, which seem to be gaining traction in light of Edward Snowden's revelations that the National Security Agency has access to just about everything we do online.  Some big-name investors are pumping millions into these startups, hoping one will be the next big thing to take off. There are apps such as Confide and Wickr that let you send self-destructing text or photo messages. There's Telegram, which bills itself as a more private alternative to WhatsApp. And we've all heard of Snapchat. But two other anonymous social networks seem to have captured the attention of plugged-in techies and venture capitalists more than anything else: Whisper and Secret.  Both apps have received heavy financial backing. Whisper recently raised a huge $30 million round, just months after raising $21 million. Secret snagged $8.6 million from big investors such as Google Ventures. And both apps have triggered a debate about whether or not anonymous apps that encourage the spread of gossip are good for the online community as a whole. By allowing users to post anonymously, these apps encourage such personal confessions as, ""I have extreme feelings of rage when people around me chew or drink too loudly."" But they also may eventually enable hateful and defamatory gossip about people. There's also concern that people will post secrets and news that are just plain wrong, but get spun into the record as gospel. We're already seeing evidence of it, at least with Secret, which launched two months ago and has seen its share of scandalous posts. I can tell you that my feed alone, which comes from a network of friends in my iPhone's address book and ""friends of friends,"" is full of caustic gossip about venture capitalists, sexism in tech, and a healthy amount of explicit sexual fantasies. In short, it's not quite the kind of content a new startup with a fresh round of funding wants to be hosting. Secret has already taken a toll on some folks in the tech industry. Earlier this month, there was the case of Julie Ann Horvath, a former developer at GitHub who alleged harassment by her bosses after someone on Secret accused her of lying about her contributions to the company. Her tweets on the issue led to the suspension of one of GitHub's founders, pending an investigation. Legendary venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has invested in almost every major startup in recent years, from Facebook to the recent crop of Bitcoin payment apps, caused a stir the other day when he posted several tweets saying anonymous apps are bad for society. ""There are other systems in past & present designed to encourage negative behavior, tearing people down, making fellow souls sad,"" he wrote in one tweet. Andreessen didn't call out Secret, Whisper or any other similar apps by name, but it was clear what he was talking about and that he views such apps as havens for negativity and hate. To its credit, Secret has tried its best to tamp down the nasty posts. Its app now shows a warning to users not to post anything defamatory or insensitive about other people. Otherwise, Secret says it has the right to remove such posts. Whisper doesn't seem to have the same scandalous cloud hanging over it that Secret does, mostly because it has a team of human editors monitoring posts for naughty content. Meanwhile, Whisper's broader strategy under its newly hired editor-in-chief, Neetzan Zimmerman, is to encourage its users to break news. In fact, Whisper has teamed with BuzzFeed editors to curate news and trends from its anonymous posts. Still, it's shaky to trust a nugget of news posted anonymously on an app used predominately by a younger audience. For example, Whisper in February claimed one of its users broke a story that actress Gwyneth Paltrow was supposedly cheating on her husband, singer Chris Martin.  Whisper's claims were met with the appropriate skepticism, and a rep for Paltrow issued a statement saying the Whisper post was ""100% false."" (However, she and Martin did announce their separation last month.) Perhaps that taps into the essence of why Andreessen and others aren't convinced anonymous social networks can be a long-term success. They may rise to popularity by allowing users to say whatever they want about anyone, without any repercussions. But over time you risk building a network full of lies and hate."

The idea came to her following a stint in politics after college, and deciding to channel the fakery and duplicity common to the political realm into something creative. ""I really got to view the political spin machine up close,"" Meade says. ""Everything before it reaches you has in some way been processed and repackaged to present a story that is fitting to somebody else's agenda. And I kind of saw this idea of taking shadows and painting them on top of themselves, taking people and painting them on top of themselves, as repackaging the same base information and turning it into something that appears completely new on the surface. But deep down is the same person; it's the same message, but with my veneer of reinterpretation on top of it."" Read more: Watch Bitcoin become a financial battlefield in these amazing charts Using the colors and values of her subjects as a guide, Meade paints them, deftly overwriting the natural visual cues that give them their depth and form. The striking result is like someone wearing a costume of themselves. She's played with several variations on the theme, blending her subjects into street art, bathtubs full of milk, interactive installations, even photographing one's travels on the DC subway system after being painted. It's an effective optical illusion that often creates great results, but Meade--who isn't a trained painter--is motivated less by representing life than by getting people to question what they're seeing. ""There are a lot of things in this world that we take as a complete given,"" she says, ""But we don't necessarily stop to take that step to think, 'OK, well what is actually underlying all of this?'"" This isn't an entirely new concept. Boo Ritson painted her subjects in a similar fashion in the middle of the last decade, albeit in a flatter style and with a reduced color palette. Something about Meade's approach resonated with viewers, though, and her experiments went viral. Read more: Say goodbye to the iPod classic Beyond broadly representing their subjects, Meade's pictures reflect her excitement about articulating ideas. She's more likely to invoke Borges or Plato than Rembrandt or Duchamp when discussing her work. Meade found her artistic path shortly after earning her degree in political science and working on Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. She quickly found herself intrigued by shadows and what they represent. Painting over the shadows cast by people, objects, fences on blades of grass, eventually she was painting more than just the shadows and seeing an allegory in painting reality on itself. ""I wanted to find a way to capture them and give this intangible absence of shape form and color — not all the shadows I paint are black. They're all sorts of different colors. So that evolved into painting shadows onto people, and all of a sudden I was turning people into paintings without even realizing it.""

Most nations appear in blue or gray, which means you can use bitcoins there.   Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies are computerized money not backed by any official authority. Governments haven't given it their blessing, and they're trying to figure out how to deal with it.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Nameless, digital wallets provide near anonymity for account holders. Bitcoin's Bankless networks make it impossible to keep track of how exactly the money is spent. And if Bitcoin were to become popular enough in a given country, that central bank would potentially lose the ability to control the money supply -- and inflation.   That makes lots of governments wary of Bitcoin. But only two have made it illegal: Iceland and Vietnam. Iceland shut the flow of incoming bitcoins, because its central bank restricts how citizens may send money abroad. Vietnam's government declared trading in Bitcoin and other electronic currencies against the law.   Others have taken an anti-Bitcoin stance but haven't made it outright illegal. China banned banks from processing bitcoin transactions, cutting off yuan-for-Bitcoin exchanges from doing business there. Russia's top prosecutor said it's illegal, but its central bank later clarified that announcement was premature.   In most other places, Bitcoin remains in a gray area. Central banks are all warning customers that Bitcoin is volatile, and governments are pondering regulations. Some nations, like Finland and Singapore, have focused on how to tax it.   As for the United States? The federal government has thus far taken a hands-off approach, but the IRS recently released complicated tax rules for Bitcoin.   Related story: IRS says Bitcoin is taxable  This is a modal window.

503,503,From farmers' markets to mass market,http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/27/smallbusiness/farmers-markets/index.html,"Mar 27, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," ""The location was terrible,"" said Gottlieb, founder of Petaluma, Calif.-based Three Twins Ice Cream.   He needed to get in front of people. He knew if they could taste his organic ice cream -- made with just milk, eggs, cream and sugar -- they'd be hooked. He decided that the Berkeley Farmers' Market, where hundreds of people bought food every Saturday, would be the best place to set up shop.   Gottlieb filled out an application, provided some details on the product, received a health permit and was accepted within a few weeks.   He was just hoping to make enough money to pay his rent. Little did he know that selling at the market would get him into grocery stores across the country.   Related: Big Gay Ice Cream's business secrets   Most people think of farmers' markets as a place to pick up healthy food from mom-and-pop-operations, but it can also be a breeding ground for entrepreneurship.   In fact, grocery stores often visit them looking for new ideas, said Harv Singh, a ""forager"" for Whole Foods' Northern California region.   ""A farmers' market is like an incubator for food companies,"" he said.   Jennifer Carlson knew her organic baby food was a hit soon after she started selling it at a local Calgary farmers' market.   In 2008, after two years selling at the market, she was raking in $30,000 a month and eventually had 10 people working for her.  This is a modal window.   She left the farmers' market in 2008 to work on expanding her company, Baby Gourmet Foods Inc., across Canada, and in 2010 her products hit Wal-Mart (WMT) shelves. Now, her product is in 2,600 U.S. stores, and Baby Gourmet Foods made $13 million in revenue in 2013.   Carlson credits her success to those early days at the market, because it helped her understand what customers wanted. She had no budget for focus groups or marketing, so she relied on face-to-face feedback.   Increased traffic to her booth was also sign that word was spreading.   ""It was clear to me from the feedback that I was receiving from moms that they wanted a product like this,"" she says. ""I started to realize that I could do this on a mass level.""   Related: Small businesses embrace bitcoin   Companies that start at a farmer's market do have an advantage, said Singh. These operations connect with thousands of customers each week and are able to do research and development through daily interactions at the market. However, moving from the farmers' market to mass market is still a lot of work.   While Singh's first priority is finding food that's different than what's already in their stores, not everyone is ready to take their product national.   ""I try and find out what kind of scalability they have,"" he said. ""Are they ready for retail? Most small vendors aren't.""   Before Carlson approached Wal-Mart, she had to figure out how to package her food so it wouldn't go bad on the shelves, while not compromising quality.   Gottlieb was making $75,000 a year at the farmers' market when Whole Foods (WFM) ""discovered"" him. In order to fill shelves across America, he had to build a 4,200-square-foot factory.   If a company can scale up, though, they'll be ahead of the competition, said Singh.   Nearly a decade after Gottlieb's foray into the Berkeley Farmers' Market, Three Twins Ice cream now has four shops in California, products in 3,000 stores, 85 employees and about $7 million in annual revenue.   While he could have stopped selling at the market years ago, he hasn't given up his Saturday spot. His parents run the booth, and it still brings in about $40,000 a year.   He likes having the direct line to his customers.   ""At the store, people either buy it or don't,"" he said. ""At the market you can see them put the food in their mouths."" "
504,504,New IRS rules make using Bitcoins a fiasco,http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/31/technology/irs-bitcoin/index.html,"Mar 31, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The Internal Revenue Service's notice last week will force the average Bitcoin user to keep a strict record of every purchase made all year long -- then perform difficult calculations to account for the changing value of a bitcoin.   It's meant to extract taxes from any gains in Bitcoin's value, and the rule applies to everything bought with electronic money, from coffee to cars.   That's problematic for two reasons. The going rate for a bitcoin fluctuates wildly -- easily by more than $10 a day. And no one diligently records the price of a bitcoin at every purchase.   ""That would obviously create an accounting nightmare for taxpayers and may cause taxpayers to avoid using virtual currency,"" said Jeffrey Hochberg, a tax attorney in New York.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   In theory, the IRS could chase after anyone who quietly spends bitcoins that are more valuable than when he or she bought them.   For example, you buy a bitcoin for $500. It doubles in value to $1,000. With your more powerful bitcoin, you can now spend it all on a guitar. You enjoyed a $500 gain in Bitcoin value, and you'll need to report that on your tax return.   ""It will get complex if you are spending at multiple merchants... over the course of a year,"" said Marc Nickel, a Silicon Valley attorney who closely studies Bitcoin.   The complicated rules kick in, because the IRS deemed Bitcoin a property. If it were labeled a currency, users would be able to treat purchases like worry-free transactions made in euros or yen while traveling abroad. That's why the Tax Foundation says the IRS got it wrong, calling the compliance requirements ""inappropriate.""   The United States isn't alone in this approach. Finland applies capital gains taxes on Bitcoin gains, and Ireland is considering something similar.   In reality, though, the IRS will have a difficult time tracking any of this. Bitcoins offer near anonymity, because computerized wallets aren't tied to actual individuals. So, while following the law will be annoyingly difficult, there's little chance of a crackdown on the average Joe.   ""Nobody in their right mind would ever comply with that,"" said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center. ""The IRS can't even get the information they need from normal consumer purchases.""   And, as former IRS commissioner Mark Everson points out, there's a big difference between new IRS rules and how it decides to administer them.   ""The service is very much strapped for resources and audits are in decline,"" said Everson, who is now a vice chairman of tax consulting firm Alliantgroup.  This is a modal window.   Alex Daley, a technology investment analyst with Casey Research, said the IRS really is just casting a wide net that lets it hunt down big tax dodgers.   ""This ruling is a warning shot across the bow, mostly to business and large traders, that you'll have to deal with the income tax evasion consequences,"" Daley said. ""I don't think it's a signal to consumers that we'll take away the anonymous nature of Bitcoin.""   If the federal government wants to keep track of people's bitcoin wallets, it could force online exchanges -- where people buy and sell bitcoins -- to follow tax rules similar to those at brokerages. Those financial institutions must submit information about clientele to the IRS, which keeps track of people's accounts.   Related story: IRS says Bitcoin is taxable   By declaring bitcoins and virtual currencies as property, the latest IRS guidance also opens the door for states and cities to apply sales taxes anytime someone acquires a bitcoin.   And things get trickier for companies that accept bitcoins as payment and keep them for a prolonged period of time. Any drop in Bitcoin value could shrink their revenue but leave them on the hook for a fixed amount in sales taxes.   Nickel hopes a mathematically-talented, smartphone app maker answers the call.   ""This is a space where the killer Bitcoin app could emerge,"" he said. ""Something that tracks your basis [Bitcoin value] and records gains and losses against market value, daily.""   In the meantime, the IRS is accepting questions about the recent notice by email. "

Lampen-Crowell offers free clinics where doctors and physical therapists do medical evaluations and he organizes fun runs known as urban herds. In Austin, one bookstore runs literary camps for kids and a pen pal program.   But the businesses know that being local is not enough.

But Oren Schauble, TrackingPoint's sales and marketing director, says the company still knows who its customers are, since they have to pass FBI background checks.

They must have some interest in keeping some kind of positive equity associated with the name. But it's obviously been heavily tarnished.""   Although he only kept half a bitcoin there, presently worth $289, investors like Dearlove say that's not the point. The value of a Bitcoin has reached $1,100, and no one can say it won't reach that again. And the higher its value goes, the more money they've technically lost. Dearlove thinks it's an investment he won't ever see again.   ""If I had to bet on it, probably not,"" he said. ""I'm certainly not counting on it."" "

It's not a blessing or a curse by the U.S. government -- but it is a sign that authorities are taking the digital money more seriously.   On Tuesday, the IRS notice said payments worth at least $600 and made with bitcoins will be taxed the same way the agency treats property transactions. That includes payments made with bitcoins, gains realized by investing in it, and income derived from producing them on your computer, a process known as ""mining.""   If you pay your employees with bitcoins, that would have to go on your staff's W-2 forms, and they would have to pay federal income tax on it. Paying an independent contractor? They have to put bitcoin payments on their 1099.   ""A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property,"" the IRS said.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   So, while it's not a ""currency"" in the legal sense of the word, it is still a virtual currency. The IRS admits Bitcoin and other electronic tokens sure function like a real currency. But the agency holds back from applying that sort of definition because ""but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.""   Though bitcoins are virtual, you can buy real things with them -- and others are willing to pay for them. But they're not backed by gold or issued by any government.   Still many governments are attempting to regulate bitcoins, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and Singapore. The IRS' notice serves as one of the first attempts by the U.S. government to regulate the digital money.   The IRS notice says bitcoins must be valued at their ""fair market value"" at the time you acquire it. That's a bit tricky, because the price of a bitcoin changes all day long. On Tuesday, it hovered at $580. But it's been as high as $600 and as low as $550 in the last week alone.   The IRS said taxpayers may rely on the going prices at online exchanges. The largest in the world right now are Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-E. "

Bitcoin wallets allow users to store the digital currency and execute transactions.   ""On March 7, 2014, Mt.Gox Co., Ltd. confirmed that an old-format wallet which was used prior to June 2011 held a balance of approximately 200,000 BTC,"" the statement said.   Karpeles said that the discovery was reported to lawyers on March 8. The bitcoins were later moved to ""offline"" wallets.   Mt.Gox was one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges until last month, when it stopped investors from withdrawing money and blamed the disruption on technical issues and cyber attacks.   The Japan-based company then filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo and the U.S., with debts totaling $64 million.   Related: How Mt.Gox went down  This is a modal window.   At the time of its closure, Mt.Gox said that it was unable to locate 850,000 bitcoins, the vast majority of which belonged to customers. The discovery reduces the number of lost bitcoins to 650,000, but also raises questions about what really happened to the missing currency.   While the search for the missing bitcoins will continue, many investors harbor little hope that all will be recovered. Japanese authorities had not regulated the exchange, and no deposit insurance was offered.   Related: 'I lost money with Mt.Gox'   Responding to the wave of doubt generated by the exchange's failure, several other exchanges and digital wallet providers have sought to reassure investors.   ""This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt.Gox was the result of one company's abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,"" an industry group said in February.   In related news, the team of volunteer computer developers who manage the Bitcoin software program has fixed some of the technical issues that Mt.Gox initially blamed for its troubles -- a quirk in the way Bitcoin works called transaction malleability.   -- CNNMoney's Jose Pagliery contributed to this report.

In 2012, about 1,000 businesses used BitPay, the largest processor of Bitcoin payments. Today, more than 26,000 businesses worldwide use BitPay, said Tony Gallippi, its cofounder and CEO.   The majority of those firms are small businesses -- about half are in the U.S. and the rest are international. And while a majority are online sellers, Gallippi said 20% are merchants with storefronts.   Most prominent in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York and Atlanta, the shops range from bakeries and wine stores to car dealers and mattress sellers.   BitPay estimates that there are currently about 5 million active digital wallets, or Bitcoin accounts, worldwide. But the currency has had its fair share of negative headlines lately for the volatile price, underground drug market busts, high-profile hacks and calls for regulation.   ""There's no government agency that's backing Bitcoin,"" said Jeffery Born, a finance professor at Northeastern University.   Related: What is Bitcoin   But these risks aren't deterring small businesses from embracing the virtual currency.   Craig Huntzinger started Bees Brothers in 2008 as a booth at a farmer's market in Cache Valley, Utah. Over the years, he added a line of honey-flavored caramels and launched an online store. In January 2012, Huntzinger started accepting Bitcoin for online purchases, which he promoted on a Bitcoin forum.    ""Initially I was fascinated by this idea of decentralized money and wanted to support it,"" said Huntzinger. Then he started to appreciate some of its other benefits.   ""It's fast and it makes it easy to sell to anybody in the world,"" he said.   It also cuts down on processing fees. Credit cards usually charge 2% to 3% in fees; BitPay and similar processors charge between 0% and 1%.   Today, about 50% of Bees Brothers transactions -- both wholesale and retail -- are done with Bitcoins. Initially, they came largely from Seattle, New York, L.A. and San Francisco. Now, he said the orders are all over the world.   Related: Alleged Bitcoin creator denies he's the one   Nashville's My Second Home, a high-end pet boarding and grooming business, began accepting Bitcoin in January. Chris Starko, its marketing director, said they felt it would give the business a competitive edge.   ""We want to be seen as a progressive company versus our competitors,"" he said. ""The [Bitcoin payment] process takes only a minute, allowing our customers to quickly pick up their pets and make their way home.""   If it takes off, he said it could account for up to 20% of future payments. ""We've had many customers tell us they appreciate it.""   Related: 6 most dangerous cyberattacks   Bitcoin's marketing potential is a big reason small businesses are trying it out, said Born. ""It's a way to attract new customers.""   It's why Dr. Max Kerr, a dentist, started accepting Bitcoin three months ago at his practice outside Austin. Kerr believes it's a novel way to ""put the business on the map,"" especially with Austin's young, tech-savvy population.   His uses BitPay to process Bitcoin transactions, which offers three options. Users can have Bitcoin payments converted into cash and deposited into their bank account, they can keep the funds as Bitcoins, or they can or opt for a combination of the two.   If merchants want to keep payments in Bitcoin, which Gallippi said less than 10% do, they need to open a digital wallet through a Bitcoin exchange.   More than half of BitPay's merchants convert the Bitcoins immediately into cash. That's what Kerr opts for, since it's a way for him to mitigate the risk.   ""In 15 seconds, I'll get an email confirming the deposit,"" he said. ""I just think of it as a cash transaction."" "

The Tokyo-based company took down its website and halted trading in the virtual currency, and has since filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Japan with debts of $64 million.   About 1.75 million bitcoins held by Mt.Gox and its customers have disappeared, according to Teikoku Databank, a Japanese bankruptcy tracking firm.   The asset freeze also extends to Mt.Gox's U.S. affiliate, and its Japanese parent company, Tibanne, according to Christopher Dore, an attorney representing an American Mt. Gox customer who is now suing the exchange.   The value of the frozen assets was not known.   Related story: How Mt. Gox went down   Even before Mt. Gox went down, the company already had big financial problems.   By its own account, the firm collected only $380,450 in revenue during most of 2012. But it lost 13 times that the next year, when U.S. government agents seized $5 million from its accounts for allegedly lying on bank documents.   Related story: Here's why Bitcoin matters   Confidence in the virtual currency has been shaken. It has lost about 50% of its value since trading as high as $1,000 last year.   But advocates of the virtual currency insisted that the problems at Mt.Gox will not spell the end of bitcoin. "
512,512,Here's why Bitcoin matters,http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/07/technology/innovation/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto/index.html,"Mar 7, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," They shouldn't be. Whether or not Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old retired engineer living quietly in California, is the father of Bitcoin is not really the point.   Bitcoin matters because it has governments and major banks scared stiff. It presents a currency that cuts them out of the picture.   China restricted banks from using Bitcoin late last year. In February, Russia's top prosecutor declared that Bitcoin and all anonymous payment systems are illegal.   For now, the United States is letting the experiment move forward. But New York state's top financial regulator has already detailed plans to regulate bitcoins sometime this year.   Banks see the writing on the wall too. In a quiet move last year, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) filed a patent for a Bitcoin-like payment system -- digital wallets, anonymity and all.   ""We have finally figured out how to send value over the Internet - faster, cheaper and more securely. We are not going to 'unlearn' that,"" said Jinyoung Englund, spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation, the currency's top advocate.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Forget money made of paper and metal. Bitcoin lives as a computer code and is created and traded electronically.   Of course, that does raise some legitimate concerns. Your entire account could be wiped out if it's hacked or your computer is lost or destroyed. Remember the British man who threw away a hard drive with $9 million in bitcoins and lost it in a massive garbage dump?   But it also means that you can transfer money from one side of the globe to the other in a flash. No fees from banks. And because bitcoins are generated by an algorithm, there are no government central banks that can induce inflation and devalue the money.  This is a modal window.   Still, Bitcoin is having a rocky start.   Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox recently filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan after losing an estimated $400 million worth of customers' bitcoins.   Related gallery: I lost money on Mt.Gox   Because of that, former bank regulator and current Boston University finance professor Mark Williams calls Bitcoin a destructive -- not disruptive -- technology.   ""At this point, it's a virtual experiment being tested in the real world, and we're seeing lots of weaknesses,"" he said   Dealing with a purely electronic currency that's barely regulated also means that exchanges and Bitcoin storage centers like Mt.Gox can easily lose massive amounts of customers' assets to software bugs or hackers. And the victims aren't protected.   What's more, speculation about Bitcoin causes its value to sometimes rise or fall more than 10% on any given day. Brandeis International Business School professor Catherine Mann doubts Bitcoin will have a future unless it becomes more stable.   ""The highly volatile price of Bitcoin undermines its use as a means of exchange,"" she said.   Bitcoin's current shortcomings are natural. It's an evolving industry led by tech entrepreneurs with zero financial experience. But it could spark a different approach to money, one of the most fundamental aspects of human interaction. And it's already given birth to other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, Dogecoin and others.   That's why in the grand scheme of things, identifying its creator is important -- but not pivotal. Besides, the Bitcoin system is now run by computer developers who donate their time.   ""We all agree that the Satoshi Nakamoto was a brilliant designer,"" said Englund. ""However, Bitcoin's inherent [decentralized] design makes knowing who Satoshi Nakamoto is a moot point because over time, the people who use the protocol and contribute to the code become ""Satoshis"" themselves."" "

But that didn't stop a bizarre car chase across Los Angeles with reporters tailing a Prius he was riding in.   Nakamoto told the Associated Press in an exclusive two-hour interview Thursday that he had never heard of bitcoin until his son told him he had been contacted by a Newsweek reporter.   Nakamoto told the AP that many details in Newsweek's 4,500-word article are correct, such as the fact that he once worked for a defense contractor. But he said the basic premise of the cover story -- that he is the face behind Bitcoin -- is completely false.   ""I got nothing to do with it,"" he said, repeatedly, according to the AP.   Bitcoin was created in 2009, but it's founder has always been shrouded in secrecy. While its creator was identified as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" the popular assumption was that name was only a pseudonym.   The virtual currency has been getting a lot of attention in recent months, both as the number of retailers accepting bitcoins as payment grows and the value climbs and falls on various exchanges.   One of the largest exchanges handling trades of Bitcoin, Mt.Gox, filed for bankruptcy last month after disclosing that much of the bitcoins in accounts there had disappeared.   Newsweek is standing by the story, which is featured in the relaunch of its print edition, its first return to print in 15 months.   Related: What is Bitcoin?

But Matt Thompson plans on selling his vacation home for this meme-inspired currency. The 27-year-old entrepreneur has been selling games and gadgets over the Internet for years, but nothing as big as his Wisconsin vacation home, which he is offering for 100 million Dogecoins. Dogecoin (pronounced DOHJ-coin) isn't something tangible like the dollar bills in your wallet. It's an open source file-sharing form of cryptocurrency that was created by programmer Billy Markus in December 2013. The newbie cryptocurrency started off as a parody of Bitcoin, using the image of a perplexed Japanese dog. Chances are, you've probably seen Dogecoin's mascot somewhere on the Internet already. As the Shiba Inu would say: Wow, much coin-cidence. But this satirical currency isn't just a punchline anymore. Through trading and transactions between users, the currency went from being worth nothing to being valued at more than $65 million, and it has a uniquely supportive community of users from the site Reddit. Thompson, a user of Bitcoins since 2011, started buying and selling Dogecoins two days after they were made available online. But the early adopter didn't think of selling his vacation home for cryptocurrency until his property got no offers after several months on the market. His three-bedroom, two-bath home is one of 2,300 properties on sale in Sawyer County, in the state's northern woods.  To attract potential buyers, he decided to accept Dogecoins as a payment form. He sees potential in it. ""I don't mind holding on to (Dogecoins) for a multitude of reasons, including that I believe I can use them to further my business,"" he explained. Thompson, who lives in Minnesota, primarily sells video and electronic game accessories online. He's been able to buy and sell inventory from places such as China by using the digital currency. ""It's safe and easy with minimal fees,"" he said. ""To date, I've found it to be very good for supplementing payment methods."" Timothy Lee, who has written about cryptocurrency for The Washington Post, says Dogecoin can be a feasible alternative to Bitcoin, but it is important to put it into context. Bitcoin is the most popularly traded cryptocurrency and has the largest community of users in the digital currency realm. Dogecoin is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, but it has a far smaller following. Ben Doernberg of the Dogecoin Foundation -- yes, the founders even established a nonprofit organization -- says what makes it special compared with its competitors is its community.  ""It was important to the founders that the currency would be friendly and accepting. Most of these Bitcoin competitors are created to make a lot of money, but it's hard to generate a healthy supportive community,"" he said. Doernberg estimates that more than 100,000 people use Dogecoin actively. That does make for a limited pool of users who can fork up Thompson's 100 million Dogecoin price tag, which translates to roughly $135,000. The value of a Dogecoin is about one-tenth of a penny, whereas a Bitcoin is valued at a hefty $630 -- and at their peak Bitcoins were trading at $1,200. Bitcoin prices plunge as technical problems persist Even though the value of Dogecoin is only a fraction of other cryptocurrenices, that doesn't mean it's easy to earn. There's a process, says Dogecoin user Lionel Vogt, who first shared Thompson's story with CNN iReport. The Georgia resident explained that people use graphic cards and their computers to help ""mine"" Dogecoins. (In doge-ism speak, it's called ""digging"" for coins.) Mining is the process used to create digital currencies -- it's where computers solve mathematical equations in exchange for Dogecoins.  It's similar to producing other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Peercoin. Dogecoin even has its own website, which has step-by-step instructions on how to get started using the currency. It also features a flashy introductory video of an animated Shiba Inu flying through a fictional city on a rocket ship. The Dogecoin community is doing more than just joking around and financing online shopping sprees. The currency is being used to raise money for events and people. Before the Sochi Winter Olympics kicked off, Dogecoin fundraisers helped send the Jamaican bobsled team and an Indian luge contender to Russia to compete in the Games. The Dogecoin Foundation and Reddit's r/Dogecoin community were able to raise more than $30,000 for the two causes. Bitcoin regulations coming this year Despite the Dogecoin community's generosity, Thompson says the cryptocurrency has its critics.  ""So many people, especially people involved with Bitcoin, tend to believe it's a copycat. I really don't think you can be so shortsighted. I believe the value of an economic system is the sum of all of its parts. So, there is room for all sorts of coins,"" he said. Markus, the creator of Dogecoin, explains that the currency is not meant to be a rival to Bitcoin. Both use the same technology. ""Dogecoin wouldn't be where it is without Bitcoin leading the way,"" said the Portland, Oregon, resident. ""Bitcoin is the trailblazer and Dogecoin is a friendly spin that helps introduce the world of cryptocurrency."" Dogecoin's longevity is also dependent on network effect, Lee explains. ""Dogecoin is sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy,"" he said. ""The more people who accept it, the more value it has. Bitcoin has a head start on that,"" he said.  Bitcoin has been around for five years whereas Dogecoin has been in circulation for three months. With the cryptocurrency still in its infancy and only a fraction of the value of its popular counterparts, it begs the question: Has Thompson received any offers for his six-acre vacation home? Not yet, he says. But he's definitely made an impression with the Dogecoin community. ""I've been asked a lot of questions about this house, and I think it's a good effect. It gets more people talking,"" he said. Dogecoin Foundation's Doernberg says all the chatter is a good thing for the digital currency.  ""The U.S. dollar is only valuable because people are willing to accept it. In currency, that is the most important thing,"" he said. ""Dogecoin's priorities are 'let's get everyone to the moon,' "" Doernberg said. ""Cryptocurrency is really powerful and instead of locking it up for a few people, let's get everyone in the world on it."""

""It's still experimental, even though it's five years old and very successful, it still is considered experimental,"" Matonis told CNN's Jim Boulden at the world's biggest mobile tech trade show in Barcelona. ""I don't think that people should treat it as non-experimental. You should only invest in trade what you can afford to lose,"" he said. Matonis' comments to CNN at Mobile World Congress come just days after Mt. Gox, one of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges, was taken offline, putting millions of dollars of investors' money at risk and shaking confidence in the digital currency. On Friday, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection at a Tokyo court on Friday with debts of 6.5 billion yen ($64 million), Japanese media reported. Matonis, speaking before Mt. Gox's bankruptcy filing, told CNN the melt-down represented the opposite of ""too big to fail capitalism"" because it was not bailed out. ""If this had been a traditional financial institution, the losses would probably be papered over with tax payer money. We didn't see that in this case,"" he said. Mt. Gox has been mired in problems since February 7, when it halted withdrawals from its accounts. The company's computer programmers hadn't accounted for a quirk in the way Bitcoin works, allowing cyber attackers to dupe Mt.Gox with a scheme resembling receipt fraud. When Mt. Gox discovered it was under attack, it stopped any investors from pulling their money out of their trading platform.  Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors on Sunday. Matonis remained bullish about Bitcoin's future, telling CNN the currency was ""massively resilient."" Further, he said, ""the exchanges that are still in existence and operating will tend to be stronger because of this."" Matonis said the currency would move out of beta in the next few years. ""I would say in about three to five years we'll start seeing user-friendly apps which really will complete the transition to mainstream. It should be as easy to download and use Bitcoin apps as it is to download something like Skype,"" he said. The currency has fluctuated wildly in value since its inception in 2009, shooting to $1,000 in December as investors began leaping into the currency. It is now around $545. Some traditional businesses, including online retailer Overstock.com, some Subway sandwich shops and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, have begun accepting Bitcoin. But the anonymous nature of the currency also has linked it with less reputable outlets. Bitcoin and other digital ""cryptocurrencies"" have been the de facto payment system on underground websites that deal in drugs, weapons and other illegal merchandise.

Gox, digital currencies are one of the fastest growing, disruptive technologies of the past several decades.   But the only places in the United States that are speaking up about Bitcoin are those who want to add additional layers of regulations and red tape.   Remarkably, it's the two states that would benefit most from this innovation and from greater adoption of Bitcoin: the nation's financial center (New York) and the hub of innovation (California).   New York's top financial cop, Benjamin Lawsky, has railed against Bitcoin because of concerns about usage by criminals. He said that it is better to stop all possible money laundering before one knows it really exists than to let ""1,000 flowers bloom on the innovation side.""   Related: 'I lost money with Mt. Gox'   That line was immediately mocked by Bitcoin fans with analogies like ""it's better to let 500 car companies die than to let one car be used in a getaway"".   Meanwhile, California legislators are considering a bill that would legalize Bitcoin -- which isn't illegal in the first place. It's clear that the state wants more control over digital currencies.   Imagine if California required all makers of 3D printers to first install software to prevent it from printing firearms before making them legal to sell. It wouldn't. But by regulating digital currency, California may constrain it with far more rules than those governing cash or gold.   So shouldn't there be a pro-Bitcoin voice in the U.S. pushing for how digital currencies can create jobs? Not to mention the issue that Bitcoin should have equal treatment to other currencies?   Because there isn't, innovation is being driven offshore.   A company called Blueseed (in which the angel network I co-founded, BitAngels, invested $100,000) is bringing foreign high-tech rock stars who cannot secure H1-B visas to work on a ship in the international waters just off Silicon Valley.   Watch: Janet Yellen says Fed can't regulate Bitcoin   This is a place where Bitcoin innovation can also happen unfettered -- up until the point it touches a US jurisdiction, of course. But is making these future job creators live and work on a ship the best our nation can do?   That's why I am proposing that a state and/or city set itself up as a special economic zone for Bitcoin. Banks would be allowed to open accounts in this zone without fear of reprisal for violating unclear or not-yet-written regulations.   Incentives could be given to bring these companies -- who are in many cases operating in a constant state of trepidation in California and New York -- into their state to create new jobs. Excessive red tape should be streamlined or suspended.   Obviously, this freedom cannot be used to tolerate true criminal behavior, but that's what the FBI and Homeland Security are there for.   As law enforcers have testified in recent Bitcoin Senate hearings, they'll find the bad guys. A few criminals don't have to cripple Bitcoin for the law-abiding majority of digital currency users.   Where should we put this special economic zone? There is plenty of precedent for states striking out on their own when they sense a disconnect with federal laws.   Related: Silk Road heist could doom Bitcoin black markets   Gay marriage and legalized marijuana (highlighted by this year's Super Bowl states of Washington and Colorado) amply demonstrate this. As does gambling.   I live in Las Vegas. Nevada legalized casino gambling way back in 1931. Today, the industry is the bedrock that Las Vegas has built its economy upon -- along with the entertainment and hospitality and trade show businesses that followed.  This is a modal window.   That has helped the citizens of the city and state thanks to big tax revenue.   So why can't Las Vegas be a special economic zone for Bitcoin? All those California jobs that are just an hour away could be brought to a state that has been doing backflips to combat its high unemployment.   In theory, any state could qualify as a safe haven for Bitcoin, particularly ones with no or low taxes. (Wyoming, Tennessee and South Dakota, are you up to the challenge?) But good infrastructure, easy access to inexpensive air travel, and a culture of promoting business and personal rights over bureaucratic clutter make Las Vegas a prime candidate.   As a Las Vegas resident for the past seven years, I'll do whatever I can to help put the first special economic zone for Bitcoin in my hometown. After all, Las Vegas is where the company that makes the RoboCoin ATM is based. But it had to go to Canada to sell its first machine due to regulation in the U.S.   Fortunately, RoboCoin ATMs are now coming to the U.S. as well. But there's no good reason they shouldn't have been here first.   Michael Terpin is the co-founder of BitAngels, the world's first angel network for digital currency startups, and CEO of SocialRadius, one of the nation's first social media marketing firms and largest PR firms for digital currency companies.

By its own account, Mt.Gox collected only $380,450 in revenue during most of 2012. It lost 13 times that the next year, when U.S. government agents seized $5 million from its account for allegedly lying on bank documents.   Confidence in the virtual currency has been shaken. It has lost about 50% of its value since trading as high as $1,000 last year.   But advocates of the virtue currency insisted that the problems at Mt.Gox will not spell the end of bitcoin.   ""It's not even possible for a single company or point to bring down the Bitcoin ecosystem,"" said Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group, in an interview with CNN earlier this week.

521,521,How Mt.Gox went down,http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/25/technology/security/bitcoin-mtgox/index.html,"Feb 25, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The shutdown of Mt.Gox -- one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges -- and the potential loss of more than $400 million worth of bitcoins is the result of abysmal mismanagement at the company.   Mt.Gox is blaming a costly computer hack for its current troubles. But in reality, the company was in dire financial straits long before that. Cash flow issues are to blame, as the exchange balanced a tiny revenue stream with a giant burning hole in its pocket.   By its own account, Mt.Gox collected only $380,450 in revenue during most of 2012. But it lost 13 times that the next year, when U.S. government agents seized $5 million from its accounts for allegedly lying on bank documents.   Such a massive loss would cripple any business, but Mt.Gox remained open. It's still unclear how it could pay its customers -- or its bills -- after losing so much money.   Ever since, though, customers noticed Mt.Gox was slow to process transactions. That gave it the aura of a Ponzi scheme. You could join Mt.Gox and give it your money, but cashing out was near impossible.   Things grew worse on Feb. 7, when it halted withdrawals. The company's computer programmers hadn't accounted for a quirk in the way Bitcoin works, allowing cyber attackers to dupe Mt.Gox with a scheme resembling receipt fraud. When Mt.Gox discovered it was under attack, it stopped any investors from pulling their money out of their trading platform.   Share your story: Do you have bitcoins?    By the time trading at Mt.Gox was halted entirely late Monday, the price of a Bitcoin there had dropped significantly, to $130. Meanwhile it was trading for more than four times that on other exchanges.   The Mt.Gox website was back online Wednesday, but only with a statement saying that the exchange had been closed to ""protect the site and our users.""   CEO Mark Karpeles also posted a statement saying he was still in Japan and working with ""different parties"" to resolve the exchange's issues.   The fact that Mt.Gox's management potentially lost all of its customers' deposits to theft is nothing short of gross incompetence. The cyberthieves would have needed to trick Mt.Gox repeatedly -- withdrawing money, faking a receipt and demanding yet another withdrawal. Now imagine doing that for a prolonged period -- unnoticed -- to the tune of millions of dollars and emptying the company's accounts.   The lack of transparency is also astounding. A company with millions of dollars is staying silent about what's going on. At most, it offers the occasional cryptic message assuring customers it's ""closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.""   Related: What is Bitcoin?   For now, Mt.Gox customers are left with more questions than answers: Was Mt.Gox really just an insolvent bank with insufficient reserves? Did it use clients' incoming funds to pay out exiting ones? And why the lack of transparency with loyal customers?   U.S. regulators won't be there to help them get their money back. Mt.Gox is based in Tokyo and isn't subject to the strict controls of Wall Street firms. It also isn't insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as most standard American bank accounts are.   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined to comment Wednesday on reports that a subpoena had been issued on Mt. Gox.   Japanese regulators have been reluctant to intervene until now. On Wednesday, Japan's government said it was assessing the situation and would take action if necessary.   U.S. officials like New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, jumped at the opportunity to say this is exactly why more government regulation is necessary. U.S. Senator Tom Carper, who heads the homeland security committee, called it a lesson for policymakers.   Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner, said Mt.Gox's failure shows the risk inherent in sending your cash to Bitcoin exchanges -- most of which are located abroad in places like Slovenia and Hong Kong. There's little assurance you'll ever get that money back.   ""The problems at Mt.Gox -- lack of strong controls and tight regulation -- are systemic to the Bitcoin industry. The reputational damage will spread,"" Williams said. ""What was the largest exchange is now a collapsed tower of toxic sludge.""   Related story: Silk Road heist could doom Bitcoin black markets   Sensing the oncoming wave of doubt, several other Bitcoin exchanges and digital wallet providers sought to reassure investors by taking a harder line with Mt.Gox.   ""This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt.Gox was the result of one company's abhorrent actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,"" the groups said in a statement.   The executives who signed the letter cast Mt.Gox's downfall as the typical industry evolution that weeds out bad actors. Tom Samson is a Bitcoin faithful in Portland, Ore., who sees Mt.Gox's failure as merely a bump in the road.   ""I for one am glad to see Mt.Gox finally die. They've been giving Bitcoin a bad name for far too long,"" he said. ""Onwards and upwards."" "

And he didn't tread lightly.   ""The complete disregard for accountability at eBay is the most blatant we have ever seen,"" Icahn said in the letter.   Related: Icahn drops Apple buyback campaign   Icahn took square aim at Marc Andreesen and Scott Cook, two members of eBay's board of directors. Icahn chastised the men for investing in and advising companies that Icahn claims are direct eBay competitors. For Andreesen, Icahn said such investments include mobile payments platform Boku and Bitcoin wallet Coinbase. In Cook's case, Icahn attacked his board seat and financial stake in software firm Intuit (INTU).   He also had some harsh words for eBay CEO John Donahue.  This is a modal window.   ""It is very sad to us that Mr. Donahoe appears to lack awareness about what is going on around him on his board and in the marketplace,"" Icahn said.   EBay hit back hard.   ""New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,"" the company said in response. ""Mr. Icahn unfortunately has resorted to mudslinging attacks against two impeccably qualified directors.""   Shares of eBay rose more than 3% on Monday.   Last month, Icahn revealed hat he had amassed a 0.82% stake in eBay and nominated two of his employees for seats on its board of directors. He also unveiled a proposal urging eBay to spin off PayPal into its own company.   Gary Hewitt of corporate governance research firm GMI said there's sometimes a gray area when it comes to board members advising multiple companies who are direct competitors. While the situation on eBay's board is not uncommon -- especially in the technology industry -- Icahn's argument does have merit, Hewitt believes .   ""Icahn has chosen to characterize it one way,"" Hewitt said. ""It can be difficult for the board to self-police on this basis.""   Related: Companies fight back against hedge funds   To be sure, there are benefits to having board members with experience in networking and deal-making in the field, according to Hewitt. But ultimately, it's up to the shareholders to decide who they want on the board.   Monday's letter also reaffirmed Icahn's determination to separate PayPal from eBay, stating that two distinct companies would make economic sense and foster greater innovation.   The 77-year old Icahn is known to take sizable positions in companies and then aggressively advocate for change in the name of shareholder value.   While Icahn is known to be tough in his attempts to shake up companies, he knows when to stand down. Earlier this month, he backed off his proposal for a $150 billion stock buyback for Apple (AAPL) after a shareholder advisory firm said it would not support his plan. "

WhatsApp gives Facebook access to the global text-messaging market, which should help the social network retain its younger users. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they believed the acquisition ""will help drive increased engagement.""   The deal also means Facebook doesn't have to worry about a rival social media company scooping up WhatsApp and its millions of dedicated users, according to Jack Kent, an analyst at IHS Technology,   ""Facebook could not risk WhatsApp's 450 million monthly and 315 million daily active users falling into the hands of a competitor, such as Google,"" he said.   Google (GOOG) reportedly offered to buy WhatsApp for $10 billion, but was rebuffed.   Still, not all investors are convinced the move is wise. Some traders on StockTwits criticized Facebook for the deal, which includes $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in stock and another $3 billion in grants.   ""$FB paying $16 billion for an app $GOOG only wanted to pay $10 for? bad management = lower prices here for $FB stock under $60 coming,"" said StockTwits user UPB.

In the meantime, Mt.Gox customers who doubt they'll ever recover their bitcoins have begun selling the rights to them at a steep discount. Those account holders have found willing buyers among speculators who believe that Mt.Gox will indeed make good on its obligations.   The speculators could make big profits: As of Thursday afternoon, the rights to Mt.Gox bitcoins were selling for around $118 each. On well-functioning exchanges, the price was around $570 per bitcoin.   The difference is that on normal exchanges, paying $570 will put you in immediate possession of a Bitcoin. With Mt.Gox, speculators are paying for the rights to the bitcoins locked up there whenever -- if ever -- the ban on withdrawals is lifted.  This is a modal window.   If Mt.Gox is able to make account holders whole, those speculators will be able to sell their Mt.Gox bitcoins at the prevailing market price. If Mt.Gox can't make good on its obligations, those investors will be left with nothing.   Related: Silk Road heist could doom Bitcoin black markets   Does that ring a bell? That kind of trade is similar to transactions in derivative products known as credit default swaps that played a key role in the financial crisis. Credit default swaps allowed investors to bet on the health of housing-related securities; with Bitcoin, they're betting on the health of Mt.Gox.   ""The market is telling you there's a huge risk that Mt.Gox is completely insolvent,"" said Leigh Drogen, CEO of Estimize, a site that crowd-sources earnings and sales forecasts.   The struggling exchange hasn't done much to inspire confidence. Asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week whether customer accounts were safe, Mt.Gox CEO Mark Karpeles refused to provide any assurances, calling the matter ""confidential.""   Mt.Gox did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNNMoney.   Many investors, however, are feeling confident. One even set up his own exchange online last week at bitcoinbuilder.com for traders to buy up the rights to Mt.Gox bitcoins.   Josh Jones, creator of bitcoinbuilder.com, said he personally has ""a ton"" of bitcoins locked up with Mt.Gox, and he is acquiring more from other account holders in the belief that the situation will be resolved.   Jones believes he'll be able to double or triple his money. In the meantime, he's earning commissions from the transactions on his site.   ""I'm pretty confident that [Mt.Gox] is going to make it all work,"" he said.   The Bitcoin system is still in its infancy.. But as it develops further, observers say they expect more offerings like bitcoinbuilder that mirror products in traditional financial markets.   ""It took me less than 12 hours of programming to do this, and I didn't have to get approval from anyone,"" Jones said. ""It's an uncertain time, and I think there's money to be made and lost."" "

And his message to the rest of the world: there's work to be done.   The Treasury Secretary said he is encouraged by Congress, which in recent months agreed on a budget, spending bill and debt limit measure.   ""Maybe -- just maybe,"" Lew said, ""we'll be able, for a couple of years, to keep doing business that way.""   By handling these matters, Washington is sending a worldwide message, one Lew says he'll bring to a gathering of global financial leaders this week in Australia.   Lew spoke in an interview with CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans as he prepared for that G20 meeting. Here are five highlights from that interview:   1. Thanks, Washington: Last year's government shutdown and the brinkmanship before it took a toll on the economy. But what matters is that Washington is getting its act together.   ""The last four months have been very different from the prior two years,"" he said.   And it's showing.   ""You look at the economic growth over the last six months -- (there's a) decided arc of progress,"" he said, specifically citing ""sustained job growth.""   But Lew acknowledged room for growth. The numbers support that: hiring in December and January was weak and far below expectations.   2. Confident in immigration reform: Lew expressed great optimism that immigration reform could be accomplished ""at some point in the not that distant future.""   ""I don't know if it's the next few months or the next year or two,"" he said. He acknowledged that the election year could dampen prospects but noted reform is ""in the political interest of all parties"" and the economy.   ""Immigration reform will even help us deal with the entitlement issues because it grows the economy,"" he said. ""It grows the payroll tax base, and it helps to support Social Security and Medicare financing.""   Related: Immigration reform? There's an app for that   3. But less optimistic on the minimum wage: But less likely to move forward, he suggested, is an increase in the minimum wage.   ""We're going to keep working at it,"" he said. ""It's obviously not in our power to force Congress to act, but we can make the case for it and we can have the American people make the case for it and we're going to continue pressing.""   Washington Democrats have argued for increasing the minimum wage to $10.10. But most congressional watchers consider that unlikely to pass. After pushing the issue in his State of the Union address, President Obama ordered federal contractors renewing their agreements with the government pay employees at least $10.10.   Both critics and proponents of a minimum wage increase took something away from a Congressional Budget Office report this week. It found a wage increase would eliminate around 500,000 jobs but also bring 900,000 out of poverty.   ""I don't believe that it's right for people to work for 40 hours and take home pay that's below the poverty line,"" Lew said.   Related: The minimum wage since 1938   4. Step up, world: The G20 conference of financial system and central bank leaders gives Lew an opportunity to speak about recovering economies in Europe and emerging markets, which have seen turmoil as the U.S. economy has improved.   He pointed to the economic collapse in 2008 and 2009 to underscore how the world's economies are interconnected.   ""The collapse of Lehman proved that when a major financial institution fails, it's not confined to one country,"" he said.   ""I think that our message to the world will continue to be the rest of the world needs to look at what can it do to promote growth,"" he said. ""We're going to do our part.""   5. Bitcoin regulations likely coming: It seems the time of unregulated virtual currency is coming to an end.   Lew didn't tip his hand, but said the innovation of Bitcoin must be balanced with legal ones.   ""As a policy matter, what we have to look at across all the different forms of payment is that the same rules apply, it's a level playing field,"" he said. ""Just as with cash or checks, if there's virtual currency or online payment methods, they'll have to comply with all the same laws that everybody else complies with. It's not going to be OK to do illicit activity, whatever form of currency you're using.""   His comments come as the online currency is on a roller coaster -- and not for the first time. Some transactions have been halted after hackers exploited a major security vulnerability. "

The brothers are launching their own exchange-traded fund, called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, to provide everyday investors a way to dip their feet into Bitcoin investing.   The price of a single Bitcoin is anything but stable. Since December, it's been as high as $1,163 and as low as $382. It's now at about $595. Lots of things weigh heavily on its value, because it's a new currency that's under close review by regulators, sometimes tied to online black markets like Silk Road and often the target of hackers looking for flaws in the digital network.   The Winklevoss brothers did not respond to requests for comment.   Winkdex got hounded for having a ludicrous sounding name that reminds everyone of Windex or Pokédex.   But those who hope to see the digital currency flourish welcomed its creation. The prevailing view is that having legitimate investors gives the currency some more credibility. "

531,531,Silk Road heist could doom Bitcoin black markets,http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/technology/security/bitcoin-black-market/index.html,"Feb 19, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Black markets on the Deep Web offer everything: money laundering and a one-stop-shop for illegal drugs and guns. But a recent series of heists, busts and fraud have shown why these bazaars can't be trusted.   In October, the FBI shut down Silk Road, the biggest online black market, seizing $3.5 million of bitcoins in the process. In November, a similar site called Sheep Marketplace was labeled a scam after it lost $6 million in users' bitcoins in an alleged hack. And last week, administrators of a revived Silk Road claimed cyber attackers sucked out all the bitcoins it held in escrow -- valued at $2.7 million.   This latest episode ""may mark the death knell for the dark markets,"" according to Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the International Computer Science Institute.   ""Between busts, scam-markets, and now mass theft, it is a task that they clearly are incapable of doing,"" Weaver said.   Related: What is Bitcoin?  This is a modal window.   The heart of the issue is that Bitcoin -- by design -- doesn't work well with shady middlemen. Anyone with access to your digital wallet can empty it forever. And all transactions are irreversible.   That's why it's not smart to fork over bitcoins to an underground website like Silk Road, which stands between buyers and sellers and holds on to money during a deal.   ""When you introduce a third party holding on to people's funds, it's absolutely antithetical to the idea of Bitcoin,"" said Evan Rose, CEO of Bitcoin ATM maker Genesis. ""You're giving someone cash over the Internet that you'll never be able to get back.""   Silk Road's new administrators said hackers exploited a Bitcoin glitch to steal funds. But in the days since the attack, it's become painfully clear that the Bitcoin system isn't to blame. Only two scenarios exist, says Andreas Antonopoulos an engineer at Bitcoin wallet service Blockchain: Silk Road's leaders were fooled into emptying all their accounts willingly, or they simply swindled their customers themselves.   Related: Bitcoin regulation coming this year   Those who currently use bitcoins to buy drugs, weapons or hire assassins also have something else to worry about. All transactions leave a permanent record that's traceable to specific wallets. Even though Bitcoins are technically anonymous, if they ever pull that money out in their name at a legitimate Bitcoin bank or exchange, law enforcement has a direct connection to a real identity.   That's why Weaver says bitcoins are essentially ""prosecution futures.""   Bitcoin tracing experts are already cropping up -- and they're teaming up with law enforcement too. Sarah Meiklejohn is a computer scientist and graduate student at the University of California in San Diego, where she explores how people are spending their bitcoins.   She said people spending bitcoins in black markets don't realize ""every bitcoin is by nature a marked bill."" And it's not as forgiving as actual cash. If police catch you buying something illegal in person, you get criminal charges for that single act. Bitcoin's permanent, public ledger gives prosecutors a much longer memory.   ""if you get caught buying drugs with bitcoins and they look at your transaction history, you get caught on every transaction you've ever made,"" she said. ""It's much more serious."" "
532,532,Drug site Silk Road wiped out by Bitcoin glitch,http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/14/technology/security/silk-road-bitcoin/index.html,"Feb 14, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," The underground website's anonymous administrator told users Thursday evening that attackers had made off with all of the funds it held in escrow. Silk Road serves as a middleman between buyers and sellers, temporarily holding on to funds in its own accounts during a deal. Buyers put their money into Silk Road's accounts, and sellers withdraw it.   At the time of the attack, here were about 4,440 bitcoins in Silk Road's escrow account, according to computer security researcher Nicholas Weaver.   The news has shaken confidence in Bitcoin. Prices dropped sharply overnight, though they've since bounced back to about $660.   Related story: What is Bitcoin?   Silk Road can only be accessed on the deep Web using Tor, a special program that hides your physical location. The FBI shut down Silk Road and arrested its alleged founder in October, but shortly thereafter, tech-savvy outlaws started Silk Road 2.0 in its place.   It is primarily used to buy and sell drugs. Bitcoins are the only kind of currency accepted on the site, because they are traded electronically and are difficult to trace to individuals. But Bitcoin accounts also lack protections that most bank accounts have, including government-backed insurance.   That means the bitcoins stolen from the Silk Road users are gone forever.  This is a modal window.   The new site's administrator, a faceless persona known only as Defcon, posted a nerve-racking message Thursday night that began with, ""I am sweating as I write this.""   He said hackers took advantage of the same flaw in Bitcoin that knocked major exchanges Bitstamp and Mt.Gox offline over the past two weeks. That glitch allowed Silk Road hackers to repeatedly withdraw bitcoins from the site's accounts until they were empty.   In detailing the alleged hack, Defcon listed the online identities of the three supposed attackers and shared records of the transactions. And in an example of the kind of dark, dangerous world of illegal drug trade, Defcon called on the public to ""stop at nothing to bring this person to your own definition of justice.""   ""I failed you as a leader and am completely devastated by today's discoveries,"" Defcon wrote, adding that the website should have followed the approach of other major Bitcoin exchanges and halted withdrawals due to the Bitcoin system flaw. Silk Road has since temporarily shut down.   Many have accused the site's administrators of faking the hack and stealing the money themselves. But in a world where drugs are outright illegal -- and there's little to no regulation of Bitcoin transactions -- it's difficult to prove anything.   It's just his kind of bad news that smears Bitcoin's credibility and keeps the currency from going mainstream.   Computer developers around the world have been working on software updates that allow exchanges to make up for the security hole in Bitcoin. The largest exchange, the Slovenia-based Bitstamp, said it was implementing a fix as early as Friday. "

The Bitcoin flaw allows these attackers to make a withdrawal from their own account and tamper with the record of that transaction. So they could cash out, but claim they never got the Bitcoins.   Here's how the Bitcoin glitch is exploited: All Bitcoin transactions are publicly recorded and set in stone every 10 minutes. But that leaves a large window for nefarious activity. In this case, attackers were making real transactions then immediately posting fake ones, confusing the exchanges' accounting programs.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Computer engineers working on Bitcoin's core functions say this kind of denial-of-service attack is inexpensive and relatively easy to pull off.   The glitch was first made public in 2011 but has not been addressed by every Bitcoin exchange. Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers, said some exchanges were getting duped because their software doesn't account for the flaw. That's why in the last several days, Bitstamp and Mt.Gox have halted customer withdrawals. Other exchanges have created software programs that avoid the glitch.   The attacks aren't affecting people's wallets or the amount of bitcoins held in their personal accounts, according to Bitcoin's leading advocates. People can still purchase goods with bitcoins, but many are unable to withdraw their money.  This is a modal window.   The assault, which is saturating the payment system with false information, has laid bare how unproven and fragile Bitcoin is right now.   ""This exposes that Bitcoin is, at best, a beta project,"" said Alex Daley, chief technology investment strategist at Casey Research. ""Until a system like this is in wide use for many years, you'll continue to find flaws in the implementation.""   Knocking such large exchanges offline has taken a toll on what little public confidence there is left in Bitcoin. Since Mt.Gox froze withdrawals on Friday, Bitcoin prices have fallen by more than 13% to $660.   Garzik and other developers are working on fixing a related computer bug in digital bitcoin wallets. Exchanges are also working on updating their software to prevent similar attacks in the future.

Mashable assistant features editor Matt Petronzio spotted on Tuesday a huge update to his Twitter profile page, with the main picture and bio scaled to the left and significantly more real estate dedicated to the header photo. The revamped tweet stream is also a departure from its signature look. There is a greater focus on photos and content cards. It moves away from a strictly vertical timeline too. Click the image below to enlarge. It's common for Twitter to quietly test new features and design updates before tweaking or rolling it out to a larger user base. Experiments typically go out to a small, random pool of users. Under the header photo in the test is the count for tweets, photos/videos (a new category called out on the profile), who you are following, followers, favorites and lists. Although Petronzio isn't verified on the site, there's an option for the stream to show ""Tweets"" and ""Tweets and replies"" for every user — a feature typically reserved for those with the blue check mark. Other profile pages viewed from an account with the new design are automatically made to look like this too. This means that even if your Twitter page isn't a part of the test, Petronzio can see what yours will look like. SEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Bitcoin in 2 minutes The recommended header photo size in the test version is 1500 x 500 pixels, up from 1252 x 626 in the current design, so users with the new design will want to switch their picture so it doesn't look stretched.

535,535,Bitcoin regulation coming this year,http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/12/technology/bitcoin-regulation/index.html,"Feb 12, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Benjamin Lawsky, New York's financial services superintendent, said he will issue ""BitLicenses"" to companies dealing with bitcoins. That would mark the most significant step thus far in the United States to regulate the digital currency.   ""Our objective is to provide appropriate guardrails to protect consumers and root out money laundering -- without stifling beneficial innovation,"" Lawsky said at a currency conference in Washington., D.C., on Tuesday.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Lawsky said Bitcoin exchanges should have to warn their customers virtual transactions are irreversible, bitcoin values are volatile and they should carefully guard their digital wallet keys.   ""We've found in other areas of the financial world that strong, clear, concise disclosures are critical to earning the long-term trust and confidence of consumers,"" said Lawsky. ""And virtual currency is no exception.""   The state of New York might also impose rules on Bitcoin-related money businesses similar to those that govern banks, although it's unclear how that would work. Lawsky's office did not immediately provide additional details.   Bitcoin exchanges might also be forced to adopt ""know-your-customer"" requirements, which force financial institutions to keep an eye on customer behavior and report suspicious activity to law enforcement. And Lawsky is even considering rules for those who use their computers to ""mine"" and create bitcoins in the first place.  This is a modal window.   The largest obstacle for regulators is that Bitcoin was built not to be regulated. Unlike the centralized U.S. dollar system, where the government has a monopoly control on the production of money and doles it out to licensed banks, the Bitcoin universe is decentralized by design. They're produced by random players around the world. They're transferred seamlessly via nameless digital wallets.   Lawsky admits that Bitcoin's unique nature leaves government officials with more questions than answers.   ""I think that's healthy -- particularly if we are being true to our stated goal of proceeding without any prejudgments,"" he said.   Related: Bitcoin is under siege   The state regulators' suggestions come after five months of inquiries that started in August. The Financial Services Department has met with Bitcoin experts, law enforcement and academics. It also held two public hearings last month in New York City that drew the attention of 14,000 people who tuned in online from 117 countries.   The question now is whether many Bitcoin exchanges would be subject to Lawsky's regulations. The two major Bitcoin exchanges in New York City that would have been regulated are lying dormant. Bitfloor shut down after getting attacked last year. BitInstant's website is down since its CEO was arrested last month for allegedly laundering money to users of online drug bazaar Silk Road.   Still, Lawsky believes regulation could add credibility to the still nascent, unstable currency.   ""If we get those rules right, perhaps we can make New York and the United States a magnet for legitimate, well-regarded exchanges and other virtual currency firms,"" he said. "

Bitstamp and Mt.Gox together house 52% of the bitcoins that trade hands, according to currency trackers at BitcoinCharts.   Since Bitstamp announced the attack Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin prices have fallen by more than 4% to $640.   Bitstamp said the problem was caused by a denial-of-service attack, the kind in which attackers flood servers with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing a system to overload. Bitstamp was unable to process withdrawals consistently.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   The Slovenia-based company said it won't resume processing Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits until it fixes the software problem.   ""No funds have been lost and no funds are at risk,"" the company assured in a statement.   On Friday, Mt.Gox, another major Bitcoin exchange, said it was halting withdrawals until it fixed a software glitch. It has yet to reopen.   Bitcoin values have tumbled since then. The price was above trading as high as $831 on Feb. 6.   Nicolas Cary, whose startup Blockchain developed a Bitcoin digital wallet for smartphones, said the event was ""simply a stress-test for Bitcoin and the community,"" which is working together to solve the problem.   But Edward Harrison, who runs the financial blog CreditWritedowns, said he worries for the many who can't access their money and what it means for currency's future.

It said the problem is not with Mt.Gox software but affects all transfers of bitcoins to third parties. It is allowing transfers to Mt.Gox bitcoin addresses as well as currency withdrawals. Trading in bitcoins also continues.   But the exchange said it was suspending transfers and third-party payments until the problem is fixed. A bug is allowing a third party receiving a bitcoin transfer to make it look as if the transfer did not go through, which can lead to improper multiple transfers, Mt.Gox said.

Recent news doesn't help.   Last week, Russia's top prosecutor declared that Bitcoin and all anonymous payment systems are illegal. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, Mt.Gox, prevented investors from pulling out their bitcoins, citing a technical glitch. Apple yanked the last remaining Bitcoin digital wallet from its app store. And earlier, a Bitcoin exchange CEO was arrested for money laundering.   The price of bitcoins has since tumbled from above $900 to $618 as of Monday. That massive drop makes it a dangerous investment and difficult to use as a currency.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Zach Harvey, an entrepreneur in New Hampshire who developed a Bitcoin ATM, describes the wild price fluctuations as growing pains.   ""The currency is far from being stable, and it probably won't be for a while,"" said Harvey, CEO of Lamassu.   But that makes bitcoins maddening both for consumers and the businesses that accept them. The constantly changing value is what drives Ryan Hurley's law firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., to cash them out every day in U.S. dollars. And it's why Sapan Shah, a Subway sandwich owner in Allentown, Penn., needs to do some extra math before he pays his suppliers in cash.   Josh Arias, a barber in Reno, Nev., started accepting bitcoins as payment from clients in September. He was forced to ask customers to email him payments after Apple (AAPL) turned its back on Blockchain, a key Bitcoin transaction app. Arias said he worries that slowing down the payments process will deter new customers from trying it out.   Meanwhile, governments are actively trying to figure out what to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoins are difficult to trace to specific people, so lawmakers have called for increased regulation. On Thursday, Russia's Prosecutor General said Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""are money substitutes and can not be used by individuals and legal entities.""  This is a modal window.   The uncertainty about Bitcoin's future makes gauging its riskiness an impossible task, said James Rickards, economist and author of Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis.   ""Bitcoin could disappear tomorrow with government intervention,"" Rickards said. ""I'd rather go to Las Vegas and play roulette, because I enjoy it.""

It is billed as a digital currency, but it's not regulated. Still, more and more vendors are starting to accept it. In the U.S., the Sacramento Kings NBA team recently announced it will accept bitcoins for purchases of tickets or team merchandise. Online retailer Overstock.com has also started accepting bitcoins. Virgin Galactic said it welcomes bitcoins for a $250,000 ride on its future space flights. A U.S. based company has already created bitcoin ATMs and plans to install one in Hong Kong. Late last year, investors flocked to the bitcoin after positive comments from U.S. policy makers. That fueled a surge in the bitcoin's value above $1000.  Much of that demand came from China.   The wild price volatility was a red flag to independent economist Andy Xie. He told me on CNN's World Business Today, ""It's not a currency. People who accept it are usually selling it for real money like for U.S. dollars or the Japanese yen.   It's like you accept Chateau Lafite. There's a price for Chateau Lafite everyday but that doesn't make it a currency."" The speculation surrounding this mysterious currency has led China's central government to squeeze the oxygen out of the bitcoin market within China. In December, Chinese regulators banned financial institutions from doing business in bitcoins.  Then the central bank warned third party payment processors to stop clearing transactions for Chinese bitcoin exchanges.   This forced BTC China, one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges in the world, to create a voucher system for buyers and sellers. In a phone interview, CEO and co-Founder Bobby Lee acknowledged, ""Trading volume has declined more than half since December.""   David Shin, an investor in a new Canadian bitcoin mine, believes China is looking to protect its own currency.   ""Given their push to try and make the renminbi a global currency like the U.S. dollar, it is in their best interest not to have an outflow of renminbi into another asset class or currency like bitcoin that they can't control,"" Shin says.  ""So I view the last set of constraints that they've put on the exchanges as nothing more than speed bumps rather than  'Do  Not Enter' signs on the road."" As for the exchanges themselves, Lee says he is open to meeting with Chinese  government officials and actually welcomes a regulated market .  ""It's the confidence in bitcoin that needs to be salvaged in China....Our objective is to develop a more sustainable bitcoin market with the support of government.

Apple removed it from the store on Wednesday.   Blockchain immediately shot back with a statement, accusing Apple (AAPL) of getting overly aggressive with future competitors. Apple is rumored to be developing its own mobile payment system.   ""These actions by Apple once again demonstrate the anti-competitive and capricious nature of the App Store policies that are clearly focused on preserving Apple's monopoly on payments rather than based on any consideration of the needs and desires of their users,"" a spokesman for Blockchain said.

Blockchain's CEO, Nick Cary, noted that the company spent more than $100,000 developing the app. He said software developers are already working on making an HTML5 version that will work through all Internet browsers, including Apple's Safari. That would essentially render Apple's stand fruitless.   ""They're on the wrong side of technology and history here,"" Cary said.   Apple hasn't yanked every Bitcoin-related app, though. Dozens still exist in its mobile marketplace as of Thursday morning.   The company's move is the latest event putting pressure on Bitcoin, which has grown in popularity because of its independence from government-controlled currencies. But Bitcoin maintains a stigma due to its frequent use in online drug markets like Silk Road.   Last week, U.S. law enforcement agents arrested the CEO of Bitcoin exchange BitInstant and charged him with laundering money for Silk Road customers. Additionally, lawmakers have called for increased regulation of Bitcoin in light of the currency's heightened privacy. Bitcoins can be traded without using names and are difficult to trace to individuals.   But bitcoins aren't just for drug dealers.

As of September, the site had nearly 13,000 listings for drugs including heroin, cocaine and LSD, prosecutors say.

The tradition of giving cash gifts of ""lucky money"" (""hong bao"" in Mandarin and ""lai see"" in Cantonese) goes back centuries and can be particularly lucrative for the young and the unmarried.  As the country increasingly embraces online transactions and e-commerce models, tradition is taking a back seat to convenience as more and more lucky money recipients prefer to receive their money via electronic means. A recent study conducted by Shanghai-based Avanti Research Partner showed that 58% of respondents preferred their hong bao directly deposited into their accounts. The country is becoming increasingly connected -- over 90% of 18 to 30 year olds in China own an internet-connected smartphone, according to a Global Times survey published last year. Of course, China's internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend, with Shenzhen-based Tencent last week launching their 'New Year Red Envelope' app, an add-on to its phenomenally popular WeChat messaging service.  The company's 600 million-plus WeChat users can send each other lucky money through their profiles, provided both the sender and recipient have signed up to the company's in-app payment service.  ""I am really happy that I can use a new and fashionable way to send my holiday greetings to my family and friends, especially for people who have kids but live far away from us,"" said Mr. Cheng, a user of the service.  The service reportedly banked 18 million RMB ($2.9 million) worth of transfers in its first 24 hours, according to a report in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. While Tencent's rival Alibaba also has a similar service, called Hong Bao, which launched last year, WeChat's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ($33) within a group of friends, adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process.   Some analysts believe that linking the payments to WeChat's in-app payment service could be a game-changer, as it streamlines the process of paying for microtransactions, potentially making users more likely to make in-app purchases in the future.  ""The tradition of giving red packets is a symbolic gesture,"" said Steve Wang, Chief Economist, Reorient Group. ""It's a way to get people more comfortable dealing with money online, and to expand their subscriber base. It leverages the old and the new, and is a great example of the kind of creative idea that we're seeing come out of China these days."" Other online money operations are looking to boost their business by tapping into the cash-giving tradition. In Hong Kong around $64,000 worth of bitcoin vouchers are being distributed by ANX, one of the city's biggest bitcoin exchanges.  It is billed as the biggest bitcoin giveaway to date, although each packet, distributed at certain shopping malls, will contain only a HK$10 ($1.29) voucher, which currently translates into 1.4 mBTC. ""The Hong Kong public is increasingly willing to embrace non-traditional ways for lai see,"" says Ken Lo, CEO of ANX.  ""We are the first bitcoin lai see that we know about, but can definitely see this as a growing trend especially to give to other people that don't live in the same country. ""The responses so far have been very positive with many people being very happy to learn they have just received their first bitcoin."" While many of the city's residents remain unfamiliar with the finer points of bitcoins, the city is coming to terms with the online currency, as Hong Kong prepares to receive one of the world's first bitcoin ATMs."

Faiella, a 52-year-old Florida man, allegedly ran an underground Bitcoin exchange using the alias BTCKing.   Shrem was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Sunday, and Faiella was arrested at his home in Cape Coral, Fla., on Monday, prosecutors said. Both are charged with conspiracy to launder money and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Additionally, Shrem faces a charge for not tipping off the feds to what was allegedly going on.   Related story: Inside Silk Road's drug market   Shrem, 24, is a major player in the Bitcoin world. The BitInstant exchange, based in New York City, lets people buy bitcoins locally at more than 700,000 locations in the United States, as well as Brazil, Russia and elsewhere. It received a $1.5 million investment last year from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Shrem is also vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, one of the currency's biggest advocates.  This is a modal window.   The Winklevoss twins said in an emailed statement that they are ""deeply concerned"" about Shrem's arrest.   ""When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,"" they said.   According to the criminal complaint filed in federal court, Faiella first appeared on Silk Road as BTCKing in late 2011. The black market website only let people buy and sell goods with bitcoins, and Faiella made a business of exchanging cash for bitcoins. That's where Shrem's bitcoin exchange came in handy.   Shrem sold Faiella the bitcoins that eventually made their way to drug buyers and sellers, according to an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. Though Shrem knew where the money ultimately ended up, he never reported it to the Treasury Department, according to the U.S. attorney.   Federal documents cite email exchanges between Shrem and Faiella that show how close they worked together. Although Shrem never knew Faiella by his actual name -- only by BTCKing -- the young executive helped the older man avoid trouble. For example, when Faiella's frequent and large cash deposits raised eyebrows at a cash processing company, Shrem advised Faiella on how to avoid sounding alarms.   The IRS claims the partners exchanged $1.05 million in bitcoins over a 10-month period ending in October 2012.   Faiella eventually ended the partnership with Shrem. By 2013, he was exchanging more than $20,000 a week for Silk Road clients.   To gather evidence against Shrem and Faiella, federal agents posed as Silk Road users and bought bitcoins from Faiella. According to the court documents, agents then traced the money they paid, which led them to Faiella and eventually Shrem.   Related story: Overstock CEO is a Bitcoin fan   Monday's news is the latest in the Silk Road bust that began in October with the arrest of the website's alleged founder. Federal agents managed to track down the website's server, which housed transaction information and private messages. Some of that information was used as part of the Shrem and Faiella arrests.   BitInstant's website was down Monday after the announcement by federal law enforcement.   Several lawmakers have called for increased regulation of Bitcoin in light of the currency's heightened privacy, given that they can be traded without using names and are difficult to trace to an individuals.   During an interview with Russian media news group RT last year, Shrem called the current financial regulations ""crazy.""   ""They're throwing me under the bus,"" he said of the U.S. government. ""They don't like us."" "

The couple separated back in 1988, but they remain locked in a legal dispute based on Patricia's allegation that the SAC Capital founder misled her at the time about the value of his assets.   ""[T]his is a family dispute,"" Judge William Pauley wrote in his ruling. ""The only thing that distinguishes it from countless others is the seemingly inexhaustible legal resources each side has brought to bear.""   Patricia says Cohen failed to disclose a $5.5 million legal settlement he received in connection with a failed real estate project. Judge Pauley rejected Patricia's civil racketeering claim against her ex-husband, though he allowed her fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims to go forward.   ""This is a case to restore faith in the old-fashioned idea that divorce is something that lasts forever,"" the judge wrote. ""[T]he Cohens' legal battles have covered a span over twice the length of their marriage.""   No trial date has been set in the case.

Kevin Roddy, a lawyer for Ms. Cohen, said she ""is grateful for the court's ruling, and she looks forward to the case going ahead.""

SAC was ordered last year to shut down its investment advisory business and pay $1.8 billion in fines as a result of insider trading by staff members.   Seven former SAC employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted of insider trading, including former portfolio manager Michael Steinberg last month. Another, Mathew Martoma, is currently on trial.

549,549,Here comes the end of QE,http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/07/investing/fed-qe-end-survey/index.html,"Jan 7, 2014","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Fed chair Ben Bernanke first suggested that the central bank was considering cutting back the amount it buys in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities last May, but the Fed didn't officially announce the tapering until last month. Instead of buying $85 billion a month in bonds, as it has been since September 2012, the Fed said that beginning in January it will from now on buy $75 billion in bonds each month.   Nearly 60% of the 30 investment strategists and money managers surveyed by CNNMoney believe the central bank will continue to gradually cut back on the bond purchases throughout this year so it can completely wind down its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus program by the end of 2014.   Brian Jacobsen, Wells Fargo's chief portfolio strategist, expects the Fed will cut purchases by $10 billion at each meeting this year until it gets down to $25 billion per month in the fall. At that point the Fed could decide to ""tear off the bandage and say, 'enough is enough'"" with QE.   But whatever the Fed does is likely to be highly telegraphed and predictable, Jacobsen added. Few expect a major change in the Fed's communication strategy now with Janet Yellen leading the Fed. Yellen was approved by the Senate on Monday to become the next Fed chair.   Full CNNMoney market survey results   Interest rates expected to rise: With the Fed expected to continue tapering, more than 90% of the strategists surveyed anticipate that bond yields will continue to tick higher in 2014. But none are expecting as big of a move as last year's.   The average estimate for the 10-year Treasury yield is that it will end 2014 around 3.4%. The 10-year yield finished 2013 just below 3%, rising more than a full percentage point from about 1.75% at the start of the year.   ""The bull run on bonds over the last thirty years is over,"" said Frank Fantozzi, president of Planned Financial Services. As investors loaded up on bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield declined from a peak of almost 20% in the early 1980s to below 2%.   But this may not mean that the bond market is a bubble that's now popping. Most strategists said that they merely expect interest rates to normalize from their all-time lows because the U.S. and global economies are continuing to recover.  This is a modal window.   The rise in rates will likely pick up pace when the Fed finally raises its key overnight lending rate, which has been near zero since late 2008. But a rate hike probably won't happen until 2015.   Still, any increase in interest rates will make it a tough year for bond investors, said Jim Kee, chief economist and president of South Texas Money Management. Last year, many bond investors lost money for the first time in over a decade. Following a 13-year streak of gains, the Barclay's Capital Aggregate Bond Index fell about 2% on a total return basis in 2013.   Related: Experts: Stocks will go up, but not by much   Bitcoin is ""too wild to forecast"": Though most Wall Street experts agree that bond yields will likely rise, there was no consensus on what will happen to the price of the last year's breakout asset: Bitcoin.   The digital currency had a stunning and volatile 2013, starting out around $13, rising as high as $1,242 in November, and ending the year around $1,000.   Of the 30 Wall Street experts surveyed by CNNMoney, more than 70% said they don't follow or analyze Bitcoin.   D.A. Davidson's Fred H. Dickson said it's ""too wild to forecast,"" while Bell Investment Advisor's Matt King and Becker Capital Management's Mike McGarr admitted they had ""no clue.""   Predictions from the brave few that were willing to make an estimate were all over the map.   Chase Investment Counsel president Peter Tuz expects Bitcoin will be worth nothing at the end of year, and Gary Goldberg Financial Services president Oliver Pursche also agrees the price of the digital currency will implode.   A few strategists expect Bitcoin will be worth something next year, but nobody thought the price of Bitcoin would go sharply higher again. The most bullish estimates ranged from $500 to $1,000. "

The machine, available for sale to individual operators such as banks and private entrepreneurs, allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin in just a few minutes.  The process should be much faster than setting up an account on an exchange or via mobile apps and computers which could take a few days for account verification. The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world.  ""It removes all the pain and barriers of entry to buying Bitcoin on an online exchange,"" said Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley.  ""Our goal as a company is to make the acquisition truly grandma friendly,"" he added. READ: What is Bitcoin? The virtual currency has generated lots of media attention in China where investors have helped drive the price up to dramatic highs above $1,000.  ""I think we're going to unleash the power of Bitcoin. It opens a virtual money portal where people can send money to and from,"" said Kelley. This is how it works:  Customers must choose to either buy or sell Bitcoin.  Let's say you want to make a withdrawal from your Bitcoin wallet. After choosing an amount of cash you'd like to withdraw, the software installed in the ATM generates a code which you have to scan with your smartphone.  Simultaneously, the machine also produces a receipt.  Following a confirmation from the Bitcoin network to your phone, you can then scan the code on the receipt at the kiosk, which then prompts the ATM to spit out the allotted amount of cash.  The machine is also equipped with a hand scanner that creates a biometric authenticated identity as an anti-money laundering measure.  Casper Cheng Tsz Chun, a Hong Kong Bitcoin enthusiast, said the ATM would work a bit like a vending machine ""for buying and selling virtual goods (Bitcoin) instead of physical goods like a can of soda."" READ: 8 things you can buy with bitcoins right now Robocoin's first Bitcoin ATM launched in Vancouver in October, and after a month of operation, transactions have totaled 1 million Canadian Dollars ($942,000) in total transactions, according to the company.  Kelley said the company has already sold 50 ATMs to other operators worldwide but they are not yet in operation. The company said it chose Hong Kong as the next place to launch its cash machine for the virtual currency because it ""responds well to technological innovation."" Kelley declined to disclose where the ATM would be located. Not every government in Asia is ready for a Bitcoin ATM. Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and Central Bank released a joint statement on their website on Monday stating it does not recognize Bitcoin as an accepted form of currency. The installation of Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs will be prohibited said Tseng Ming-chung, FSC chairman in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency. ""Bitcoin is not real currency and banks cannot receive or provide it. Installing ATMs require the authorization of the FSC, but it will not be approved, thus it is 'impossible' for Bitcoin ATMs to enter or appear in Taiwan,"" Central News Agency reported.  The statement also warned institutions against the risk of investing in Bitcoin because of the extremely volatile price. China's central bank issued new rules in December that prohibited financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency. While it did not outlaw individuals from owning Bitcoin, it specifies that it is not to be considered a currency.  Despite the setback, Robocoin's chief executive said he still firmly believes China will come to accept Bitcoin. ""Citizens around the world love Bitcoin. The Chinese are very pragmatic in their approach, they just want to make sure they have a very good understanding of the market and the usage,"" he said.

The test -- which Zynga is conducting with Bitcoin service provider BitPay -- will let players use the ""cryptocurrency"" for in-game purchases in FarmVille 2, CastleVille, ChefVille, CoasterVille, Hidden Chronicles, Hidden Shadows and CityVille.   While many Zynga customers play games for free, some opt to pay real money for virtual goods like cows, crops and other items to help them progress.   Related story: What is Bitcoin?   Zynga (ZNGA) is launching the experiment ""in response to Bitcoin's rise in popularity around the world,"" the company said in its Reddit post. A company spokeswoman confirmed the post's veracity on Monday, but she declined to comment further.   Bitcoin's meteoric rise was one of the hottest tech stories in 2013. The so-called cryptocurrency, created in 2009, lets people buy goods anonymously. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on marketplaces like Mt. Gox, or ""mined"" using computers to solve complex math problems. Some buy bitcoins as an investment.   That speculative interest has pushed the price of bitcoins higher and higher, from $13 last January to more than $1,200 in December 2013 -- leading to bubble concerns and volatile price swings.   The Zynga news helped push Bitcoin higher on Monday, when the price briefly climbing to nearly $1,100 apiece on Mt. Gox before falling back near $1,000.   Last month, Overstock (OSTK) became the first major U.S. retailer to accept Bitcoin.   - CNN's Tom Boltman contributed reporting.  "
552,552,The top 10 tech stories of 2013,http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/23/tech/web/top-tech-stories-2013/index.html,"Dec 23, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"The biggest technology story of 2013 is one of the biggest stories of the year, period. It has had serious implications in the United States and around the world, and half a year later its true impact is only beginning to be felt.  In June, the Guardian first published leaked documents from National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The classified documents contained information about highly confidential government programs that collect massive amounts of data about Americans' cell phone calls and Internet activities The scope of the program has led to lawsuits and protests, a public debate about the right to privacy versus the government's need to secretly collect information for security.  Another big story this year was cybersecurity, illustrated by a string of attacks by hackers against news organizations, major tech companies and retailers. The motivations behind the attacks varied: Some, like the recent Target breach, were financially motivated, while others were political statements or acts of espionage. They all highlighted the limits of online security and privacy.  It was a year when established tech companies struggled to reinvent themselves. Microsoft continued to push its new Windows 8 operating system and Windows 8 smartphones, even going as far as to buy the No. 1 maker of Windows phones, Nokia's mobile division. In the end, it wasn't enough and the company decided on one more big change: a new CEO.  A bright spot for Microsoft could be its new game console, the Xbox One, which is competing against Sony's new PlayStation 4.  Apple didn't have to switch much up to stay popular. It announced an expected update to its iPhone and iPad lines with the usual fanfare, slimming down and speeding up the devices, throwing in some flashy features like a fingerprint scanner and new colors to keep the masses interested.  A more dramatic overhaul was of the iOS 7 mobile operating system, which was flattened, simplified and updated. Twitter went public and released a new social micro-video app called Vine, Snapchat broke out of the naughty-messaging market and made ""ephemeral"" communications a hot feature, and virtual currency Bitcoin skyrocketed in price while people waited to see if it would drop back down to Earth.  Some of 2013's big stories were just previews of what's to come in 2014. Wearable technology moved from the hype stage to the prototype stage, but Google Glass and the myriad of not-ready-for-prime-time smartwatches just showed the industry still has a lot more work to do (on design and social norms) before these gadgets are hot holiday items.  Tune in next year and see whether face-mounted computers become a socially acceptable accessory, 3-D printed guns become something to worry about and original content from sites like Amazon and Netflix can take on TV."
553,553,Online retailer Overstock to accept Bitcoin,http://money.cnn.com/2013/12/20/technology/innovation/overstock-bitcoin/index.html,"Dec 20, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Byrne said customers will be able to use the virtual currency to make purchases on Overstock.com (OSTK), which sells everything from digital cameras and bed sheets to patio furniture and even cars. The company is expected to have total revenue of $1.3 billion for 2013, according to FactSet Research.   ""We think there's going to be a market in Bitcoin, and we want to get in front of it,"" said Byrne. ""We want to be the first major e-tailer that accepts them."" Byrne first made comments about Overstock.com accepting Bitcoin in an interview with Bitcoin blog newsBTC and later in the Financial Times.   Overstock plans to begin accepting Bitcoin near the end of the second quarter of 2014. Byrne said the move stems partly from his background in the Austrian School of economics, which is associated with the Libertarian party in the United States.   ""We're the guys who like gold,"" he said. ""We think the monetary base should not be something that a government can create with a stroke of a pen.""   Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not backed by any government authority or central bank. It exists only on the internet and is ""mined"" by powerful computers that solve complex math puzzles.   Byrne said he is concerned about the possibility of ""bad currency wars"" in the future. He said the U.S. dollar is already being undermined by the Federal Reserve's easy money policies and by overspending by politicians in Washington.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Like gold, Byrne said Bitcoin should hold its value better than the dollar because it is ""mathematically constrained"" and cannot be manipulated by government authorities.   There are currently 12.1 million bitcoins in circulation, according to blockchain.info. The total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million.   Critics say Bitcoin is at best a fad and at worst a haven for criminals looking to buy and sell illegal goods anonymously. But supporters argue that Bitcoin is a more democratic alternative to traditional currencies.   Former U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, an outspoken Libertarian from Texas, has said that Bitcoin could be the dollar's ""destroyer"" if it goes mainstream.   Bitcoin has exploded in value this year, rising from about $13 in January to more than $1,200 earlier this month. On Friday, bitcoins were trading at about $739 on the Mt. Gox exchange.   The currency is prone to wild swings and experts say Bitcoin will remain volatile as the technology evolves.   Byrne acknowledged that the volatility is a problem and that Overstock will need to ""continually convert Bitcoins into dollars"" to avoid losing money. Eventually, he said there will be a derivatives market that will allow companies to hedge their exposure to Bitcoin.   Related: Bitcoin worth almost as much as gold    In some respects, it's not a surprise that Overstock would move to accept Bitcoin. The company is unconventional. It is known for quirky ads and for shortening its name online to O.co.   Byrne also has a penchant for writing long, rambling shareholder letters in earnings reports. And he famously appeared on ""60 Minutes"" to complain about short sellers who were betting against his stock. He even told CNNMoney in 2003 that ""When opportunities come along where we can knee the shorts in the groin, that's always good for fun and amusement. That's just icing on the cake.""   But Overstock is not the first business to embrace Bitcoin.   British entrepreneur Richard Branson made a splash in November when he announced that his that his commercial space travel venture, Virgin Galactic, will allow customers to pay for their flights with Bitcoin.   China's leading search engine Baidu (BIDU) also accepts Bitcoin for certain services. And a car dealer in California recently accepted Bitcoin as payment for a Tesla (TSLA) Model S, valued at $100,000.   Bitcoin has been a particularly popular investment in China, but regulators have been cracking down. This week, China's largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, abruptly stopped accepting new deposits. That came after China's central bank issued a warning and announced new rules for financial institutions dealing in bitcoins earlier this month.   European Union officials have also warned about the risks of Bitcoin and may consider regulating the currency. "

That's the biggest drop since 1981, said Kevin DeMeritt, president of Lear Capital, a precious metals firm based in Los Angeles. It's also the first year-over-year decline in gold prices since 2000, according to FactSet.   Investors have been selling gold futures and gold-backed ETFs this year as stocks have soared to record highs. Prices for physical gold, including bars and coins, have fared better thanks to demand from investors in China.   Related: China becomes world's top gold buyer    The rout follows a long-running bull market in gold. Even after this year's losses, gold is still up nearly 350% since 2001, when it traded below $300 an ounce.   Gold hit a nominal (i.e. not adjusted for inflation) all-time high near $1,900 an ounce in 2011.   The latest slide comes one day after the Federal Reserve announced plans to cut back on, or taper, its bond buying program.   While it will be buying fewer bonds, the Fed also stressed that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low even after the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%. Investors took that as a sign the Fed will continue to flood the market with liquidity for years to come.   Related: Gold miner Newmont is one of the worst performers in the Fortune 500   The policy changes also suggest the Fed is becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of deflation, said Ashraf Laidi, global strategist at City Index in London.   Inflation has been subdued all year and remains well below the Fed's target level of 2%. Consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose only 0.2% in November from October, according to government data.   Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation since precious metals tend to hold value better than assets such as stocks and bonds. With no sign of inflation on the horizon, investors have little reason to own gold.   Laidi said gold prices could fall to $1,100 an ounce in the near term on worries about deflation.   Related: Bitcoin prices rival gold   But some analysts say this year's sell-off has been overdone and that gold could bounce back in 2014.   DeMeritt said gold is currently trading at ""production value,"" which is roughly what it costs miners to locate and unearth the metal. That suggests gold has ""over corrected"" and could benefit next year as investors look for undervalued assets.   His target price for an ounce of gold in 2014 is between $1,375 and $1,400. "

And given China is a country with strong practice of savings,"" Bobby Lee, CEO and co-founder of BTC China, told CNN. ""It is quite understandable that the Chinese would want to explore bitcoins as yet another potential asset class for investing some of their savings.""  In recent years China has been pushing to internationalize the yuan, adding more value to the once tightly controlled currency on international markets.  But despite the changes, controls mean individuals still find it difficult to invest in assets outside China. As a result, more Chinese are looking to invest in alternative assets like bitcoin. Trading in the digital currency has been extremely volatile. Early in November the currency rose to what was then an all-time high of $900 earlier, only to fall back to $500 in the span of 28 hours. By last Friday, it was trading as high as $1,242. Bitcoin worth almost as much as gold ""Chinese interest could play a huge role in turning bitcoin into the first trillion dollar non-fiat currency,"" Stan Stalnaker -- founding director of Hub Culture and the Ven, an asset-backed Internet reserve currency -- recently wrote in a CNNMoney opinion piece. ""Ironically, it is the United States, the 'free market' financial heavyweight in the world, that finds itself moving slowly to figure out how to adopt bitcoin,"" he wrote. ""Meanwhile, China is proving to be a leading player in this 21st century currency."" However, digital currencies are not officially recognized as legitimate in China. In 2009, the government restricted the use of QQ coin, a popular virtual currency created by tech tycoon Tencent, to only virtual products.  Now Bitcoin faces a similar move.  China's central bank warned late on Thursday that Bitcoin carries substantial risks and issued new rules to prohibit financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency.  Ron Paul: Bitcoin could 'destroy the dollar' Under the new regulation, financial institutions in China are banned from trading, underwriting or offering insurance in bitcoin. In addition, websites in China that provide trading services are required to report investors' identities to regulators and take steps to prohibit money laundering. Following the central bank's announcement, the bitcoin price on the Chinese market shrunk by more than 20% and is still in decline.  While the central bank did not outlaw or prohibit individuals from owning bitcoin, the guidelines specify that it is not to be considered a currency.  With his past gains, Liu is happy to besitting out the current bitcoin boom and bust. ""The ongoing trend is nothing more than a hype to attract geeks,"" he said. ""It's still very hard to spend. And I'm not investing more in bitcoin until I can use it to buy things from Taobao and Amazon."" ""These are speculators that don't have faith in Bitcoin's value. They'll bailout from the market immediately after they suffer a deficit,"" he added.  "

The currency, which trades non-stop on the Mt. Gox exchange and other online markets, has been extremely volatile and swings of $100 or more in just a few minutes are common.  This is a modal window.   In the United States, lawmakers have been examining potential regulations for Bitcoin, which is the currency of choice on certain online markets for drugs and other illicit goods.

Unlike traditional paper currencies, bitcoins are not managed by a central authority and exist only in cyberspace.   Bitcoins are ""mined"" by powerful computers that complete complex math problems.

And while it's far from achieving any of them -- its value is unstable and it's rarely used -- some have high hopes.   ""There will be alternatives to the dollar, and this might be one of them,"" said former U.S. congressman Ron Paul. If people start using bitcoins en masse, ""it'll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar,"" Paul added.   It's unlikely that Bitcoin would replace the dollar or other government-controlled currencies. But it could serve as a kind of universal alternative currency that is accepted everywhere around the globe. Concerned about the dollar's inflation? Just move your cash to bitcoins and use them to pay your bills instead. Tired of hefty credit card fees? Bitcoin allows transactions that bypass banks.   Related: What is Bitcoin?   Even economists who embrace the power of central banks, like University of Michigan professor Miles Kimball, recognize the currency's potential.   ""Bitcoin really shows governments are behind the curve,"" Kimball said. ""It demonstrates there's a demand for an electronic equivalent of cash.""   Bitcoin is hardly the first attempt at a digital currency that operates outside of state boundaries. Ebay's (EBAY) PayPal plans to launch a digital interplanetary payment system. There's also growing support for a concept called seasteading, floating cities on international waters where business and innovation aren't held back by laws.   Millions of Africans, particularly in Kenya, make payments simply by texting one another. The widely used M-PESA system allows people to bypass banks and electronically transfer cash. Some even use mobile minutes as a form of currency.   Digital payments make buying items internationally a smoother process, because exchange rates are gone and there are no cumbersome bank regulations or fees. It also enables people to make payments in areas without bank access or where carrying cash can be dangerous.  This is a modal window.   However, Bitcoin has advantages other digital payment systems don't. Transactions don't require names -- just digital wallet IDs -- which makes them more private than credit cards.   More importantly, the system was designed to produce a slow and steady supply of bitcoins, making it less susceptible to losing value via inflation.   ""That's the holy grail for people who believe in freer markets and currency,"" said Adam Gurri, a libertarian economics writer in New York.   There are no middlemen charging fees to move money between users. You can transfer bitcoins -- even infinitesimally small fractions of one -- directly to others' digital wallets.   Related: Bitcoin worth $9M buried in garbage dump   But don't expect governments and banks to let Bitcoin take over so easily. Financial institutions will lose business if people stop using their payment systems, and central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve would lose their ability to help slow and speed up economic activity. Paul expects banks to lobby and authorities to crack down.   ""Governments absolutely demand a monopoly on money and credit. They're not going to give it up easily,"" Paul warned. ""They will come down hard.""   Kimball hopes politicians will take a less combative approach, choosing instead to compete.   ""I suppose they could just try to crush Bitcoin, but that's the wrong way to do it,"" Kimball said. ""Governments should be creating their own version of Bitcoin. They should be ashamed they haven't.""   But everyone agrees that restraining Bitcoin's development would negate any of its promises to entrepreneurs.   ""We have to make improvements in our payment system. The progress of humanity depends upon it,"" said Mark Thornton, a senior fellow at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, a libertarian economic organization in Alabama. "

Stocks ended November with gains of between 3% and 4%. Stocks have been on a tear this year, with the S&P 500 up nearly 27%. Solid corporate earnings and continuing bond purchases by the Federal Reserve have helped spur strong buying this month, pushing the Dow and S&P to record highs.   Retailers were in focus as consumers turned out in droves for Black Friday.   The annual shopping bonanza kicked off earlier than usual, with some of the biggest stores such as Sears (SHLD)-owned Kmart, Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Macy's (M) and Target (TGT) opening their doors on Thursday evening.   While the early openings drew large crowds, shares of most major retailers were only modestly higher Friday.   Related: Early store openings appear to have worked for retailers   Wal-Mart appears to be the most popular destination, with foot traffic up 160% over the normal shopping day, according to data on users of the smartphone app Shopular.   Target reported ""unprecedented numbers"" of shoppers in stores and on the company's website.   Yet the large turnout of bargain hunters may not necessarily translate to big profits for retailers, said Brian Sozzi, chief strategist at Belus Capital Advisors. Despite the large crowds, Sozzi said the hauls consumers brought home were relatively modest at the shopping centers he visited.   ""My sense is that retailers will have to raise their level of promotions to close more sales,"" he said. ""I just didn't see the bag size and bag count one would expect given ramped up promotional messages.""   Not all shoppers were willing to brave the crowds on Thursday and Black Friday. Thanksgiving online sales are up nearly 20% over the same period last year, according to data from IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark.   Apple pie and Bitcoin is golden: Apple (AAPL) shares were getting some Black Friday love. The stock rose back above $555 a share, a level it hasn't hit since early January. The iPad and iPhone maker has clawed back from deep year-to-date losses in the summer, when prices fell below $400 a share. Apple's stock is now up almost 5% in 2013.

One is Silk Road founder Dread Pirate Roberts, who the FBI claim is currently in their custody. The other is Satoshi Nakamoto, the still-unidentified creator of Bitcoin.   Both have gained in notoriety in recent months. In October, the FBI shut down Silk Road, commonly referred to as the eBay for drugs (and much more). It was accessible only on the deep Web via the anonymizing software known as Tor. To keep sellers and customers safe, Silk Road dealt only in bitcoins, which are difficult to trace to an actual person.   Related: How Silk Road was reborn   But the Bitcoin system maintains a public log of every transaction.  This is a modal window.   In a research paper, Weizmann Institute computer scientists and mathematicians Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir explored that log, discovering that Silk Road's founder received a substantial sum of money in March from one of the first Bitcoin accounts ever created -- likely belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto. That transfer of 1,000 bitcoins would be worth $811,100 as of Monday.   ""Such a single large transfer does not represent the typical behaviour of a buyer who opens an account on Silk Road,"" the paper states. ""It could represent large scale activity on Silk Road or some form of investment or partnership.""   The discovery will add to rumors that Satoshi Nakamoto and Dread Pirate Roberts are co-conspirators -- or perhaps even the same person.   Because the findings suggest a strong connection between the virtual currency and the black market, it contributes to concerns that Bitcoin facilitates illicit transfers of money. However, critics might note that the research paper, released Sunday, was sponsored by a grant from the Citi Foundation, the charity arm of Citigroup (C), one of the world's largest banks.   The same analysis also reveals that the 144,336 bitcoins the FBI seized during its Silk Road bust represent only 22% of the black market kingpin's commissions. If true, that means Dread Pirate Roberts earned $518 million -- and the U.S. government has found only $118 million of it. "

Gold dipped as low as $1,211 an ounce in June.   Gold has been under pressure since the European Central Bank announced a surprise interest rate cut earlier this month, said Carlos Sanchez, analyst at precious metals firm CPM Group.   That drove up the value of the dollar versus the euro and made dollar-denominated assets, such as gold, less attractive.   The selling accelerated Wednesday after minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve raised speculation that the central bank could scale back, or taper, its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, as soon as December.   But gold prices managed to hold above $1,240 an ounce, which is an important support level for technical traders, said Sanchez.   ""I think we're at the lows,"" he said. ""This is a good buying opportunity for mid to long-term investors.""   Sanchez said the economy is not yet strong enough for the Fed to begin tapering next month.   Related: China becomes world's top gold buyer   What's more, Sanchez said the central bank could ""offset"" the impact of tapering by signaling that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for longer by reducing its target for unemployment.   ""While tapering will occur, the Fed doesn't want to do it in a way that causes interest rates to spike higher,"" he said.   Gold has been punished this year as investors pulled money out of safe havens to chase higher returns in the stock market. Stocks have soared to record highs in the latest phase of a nearly five year-old bull market.   ""The race up in equity markets has some institutional investors wondering why they should hold gold when Wall Street is booming,"" said Jeff Nichols, managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors.

Peter Schiff, market strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, said Bitcoin lacks the ""intrinsic value of gold."" He added that he thinks Bitcoin is destined to fail once early adopters decide to cash in and the market collapses.   ""It's Tulip Mania 2.0, not Gold 2.0,"" he said.   That may be true.

So, grab a smartphone, put on your best duck face and celebrate. Oxford Dictionaries' word for the year for 2013 is ""selfie."" And when you share that filtered photo on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, you'll join not just Anthony Weiner and Geraldo, but millions of others around the world perpetuating a tradition started over a decade ago, Oxford says.

I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie."" Yes, the first-ever known mention of the word ""selfie"" stemmed from an inebriated mouth with teeth protruding through its bottom lip. Given those circumstances, Oxford may not much care how you spell it. You could go with ""ie"" or ""y,"" as in ""selfy.""  Oxford says that doesn't change the official definition: ""A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website."" Complete unknown For years after its birth, ""selfie"" crept through the web largely unnoticed.   But in 2012, the word of the year began its ascent to digital fame, Oxford says.  Suddenly, everybody around the world was using the word, as they self-snapped away. Related: 'Selfies at funerals' must die  By August this year, Oxford proclaimed it a real English-language word and gave it a place in the dictionary -- but that was merely a stepping stone to lingual infamy. ""Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year,"" Oxford wrote in justifying its choice. ""Selfie"" beat out seven competitors, including ""twerk,"" ""schmeat"" (synthetically produced meat) and ""bitcoin"" for the Word of the Year crown. ""Selfie"" is not slouching on its thrown, Oxford says of its word of the year.   It has spawned herds of images on social media. There are 57 million photos bearing its hashtag -- #selfie -- on Instagram alone.   There is even a user account called ""selfie."" And, yes, it contains nothing but selfies. ""Selfie"" has also been busy pumping out offspring in its namesake. It has given birth to ""helfie"" -- a photo of one's own hair; ""belfie"" -- a snapshot of one's own backside; and ""welfie"" -- a selfie taken while working out, aka the most annoying kind. There's also the ""drelfie"" -- a photo of yourself when you're drunk. Fitting, since a drelfie in Australia was the first ""selfie"" that ever bore the name."

Stocks lost momentum in afternoon trading after Carl Icahn said he is ""very cautious"" on the stock market going forward. Speaking at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook summit, the billionaire activist investor said he could see a ""big drop"" in stocks. Icahn blamed earnings for his downbeat outlook, nothing that companies are boosting profits thanks to low borrowing costs instead of strong management.   Still, the Dow and S&P 500 are up more than 20% so far in 2013.   Experts say that this year's roaring bull market is due largely to stimulative monetary policies from the Federal Reserve as well as decent corporate earnings.   Investors will be keeping a close eye on the Fed in particular during the coming months. Current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, the architect of the central bank's bond purchase program, will leave that role when his term expires at the end of January. Bernanke is likely to be replaced by Fed vice chair Janet Yellen, who just needs to be confirmed by the Senate.   The market has been encouraged by comments from Yellen during her Senate confirmation hearing last week about how the Fed's policies, particularly the $85-billion-per-month bond-buying program, can continue to help the market and economy.   But ultimately, Yellen is expected to scale back, or taper, the bond buying program at some point next year, raising questions about how much longer the nearly 5-year old bull market can last. In fact, there are some traders who think it's possible the Fed could announce it will begin tapering following its next policy meeting in December.   StockTwits user Learnstocks101 quipped, ""$SPY What happens if Ben yells 'taper' in a crowded bull market?""

Do politicians see a currency they can't track or control as a threat -- or an asset?   It's anyone's guess. But it's clear bitcoins are growing in popularity. The price of the currency soared to a new all-time high of $675 Monday, up from only $12 a year ago. Without meddling banks in between transactions, bitcoins trade seamlessly and offer nearly as much privacy as cash.   That's why the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is hearing from various sides Monday. According to prepared statements from the Justice Department, an official at the DOJ said it needs more help catching criminals who use the secretive currency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin users want the government to back off and let the system blossom.   Related: Donate to typhoon victims ... with Bitcoin   Law enforcement doesn't like the anonymity: There are legitimate uses for bitcoins. But it's also being used to anonymously buy drugs, hire assassins, trade child porn and dodge taxes.   The nation's acting assistant attorney general, Mythili Raman, described the more notorious ways bitcoins are being used. She mentioned the recent FBI shutdown of Silk Road, an online black market. Illicit drugs and services -- like hacking -- were sold there using the (mostly) untraceable currency. The agency arrested its alleged founder and seized 170,000 BTC, valued at $101 million as of Monday afternoon.   The way bitcoins are transacted -- using coded wallets and special keys that don't need real names -- enables substantial privacy. Raman said that makes it more difficult to follow the money and catch criminals. It would be easier to fight crime with ""appropriate anti-money laundering and know-your-customer controls,"" she said.   Along those lines, there are concerns that those making money from sex trafficking and pornography involving children have started to adopt Bitcoin.   The International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children noted how anonymity offered by Bitcoin has made it the currency of choice for predators. The nonprofit group's president, Ernie Allen, says he's not against the digital economy. But he wants it less private.   ""If the perception of anonymity diminishes, we believe the criminal use will diminish with it,"" he said in prepared remarks.   Edward Lowery III, who leads the Secret Service's criminal investigative division, added that the technologically complex Bitcoin system makes it hard for everyday agents to stay on targets' tails. They need more tech-savvy investigators than the agency can currently afford.   Also chiming in was the potential regulator that could one-day ruin the unregulated Bitcoin party: The Treasury Department.   Treasury already issued guidance in March saying that groups exchanging bitcoins must register with the government and keep records. Everyday bitcoin users remain unregulated. Jennifer Shasky Calvery is head of the department's financial crimes unit and warned about leaving the bitcoin community untouched.   ""One of our biggest challenges is striking the right balance between the costs and benefits of regulation,"" she said.   The Bitcoin community doesn't want too much regulation: Fans of Bitcoin say the currency is going mainstream, and it's not just for internet weirdos. That's why they want the government to give it a chance to grow and thrive without tacking on burdensome rules.   The Bitcoin Foundation, a group that seeks to strengthen the digital system, is trying to convince politicians the currency works as is.   ""The American people have been reminded this year of reasons to be concerned for their privacy,"" says the group's attorney, Patrick Murck, referencing the recent disclosures about unwarranted government spying on innocent citizens.   Related: Why China wants to dominate Bitcoin   The group also notes that meetings with financial regulators have gone well so far, but the Treasury Department should have met with Bitcoin supporters before taking a stance earlier this year.   Academic researchers say that coming down too hard on the digital currency could push its innovative potential abroad.   Jerry Brito, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, feels that entrepreneurs have a lot to gain from bitcoins. Without banks, they're also more accessible to the world's poorest. Plus, they're not controlled by a central bank that can run rampant printing money and bring on hyperinflation.   But regulators can't get their heads around it. They might want to treat it as a foreign currency, a commodity or a payments network -- but it's not any of those. However, stopping it would be a dumb move.   ""Restricting the use of Bitcoin will only ensure that criminals alone will use the technology,"" Brito and research assistant Andrea Castillo wrote in a report to Congress. "

Bitcoins are still being viewed cautiously by lawmakers and regulators in the United States. In fact, there are two Senate hearings this week about the risks Bitcoin poses. But that is decidedly not the case in China. There has been a steady drumbeat of positive news in the Chinese press this year, including a landmark report on CCTV, China's national television network.   China's fascination with the currency upstart resulted in an estimated 40,000 client downloads a day and a burgeoning acceptance rate from online retailers down to physical traders standing in Tiananmen Square.   The largest Bitcoin exchange in the world is located securely inside China, and one of the world's largest Internet companies, Baidu (BIDU), is integrating and using Bitcoin. It seems highly unlikely that Baidu would be able to integrate Bitcoin payments across its vast network of users without some sort of complicit nod from higher authorities.   Chinese interest could play a huge role in turning Bitcoin into the first trillion dollar non-fiat currency.   Related: China fuels Bitcoin surge to record high   So why has China been so quick to embrace the virtual currency? It has been down this road before. In 2009, the government moved to staunch the rapidly rising phenomenon known as QQ, the virtual currency from social juggernaut Tencent (TCEHY).   In just a couple of years, QQ had grown to such an extent that some estimates put it at 13% of the Chinese cash economy. It was threatening to supplant the yuan in a viral tsunami that showed no signs of abating. At its height, people similarly gathered in public places to trade QQ, and shopkeepers began accepting it for payment.   Because Tencent controlled QQ through central online reserves, the Communist Party's response was swift, hobbling QQ at its knees and bringing it well back into line overnight. How did they do it? Since QQ was centrally managed, all the Chinese government had to do was tell Tencent to limit QQ's use or face a total shutdown of their business. So Tencent reeled it in.   Such a move is not so easy with the decentralized cryptography of Bitcoin, and Chinese officials know that.   Within months of the chop on QQ, the Bitcoin algorithm was released anonymously online. Bitcoin is difficult to trace. And as the open source aspects of Bitcoin grew and strong demand began to push up prices, China took notice, perhaps having been more aware than others of how quickly and completely these things can take off.   In terms of geopolitics, the implications of Chinese support for Bitcoin are clear and complicated for the U.S. The more bitcoins a person or entity control, the higher their influence in all things Bitcoin. While it is unlikely anyone will ever control more than 51% of Bitcoin, such an event could put the currency under control of that actor.   In the meantime, Bitcoin presents a marvelous gift for China, a country anxious to exert financial influence on a global scale, but nervous to overtly undercut the U.S. dollar, which it holds in abundance.   It could also help China exert more economic influence over commodity-rich Africa. Digital currencies like Bitcoin are already set to take off there and bring financial inclusion to 2.5 billion of the world's most under-banked.   Related: Donate to typhoon victims ... with Bitcoin   As Bitcoin infrastructure matures, it has the potential to be used as a currency in commodity markets and other areas of trade with lightning quickness, from gold to wheat to cotton and, yes, oil.   In Africa, this could mean the destruction of weak country currencies, large scale consumer adoption via mobile payments, and a new era for Chinese financial supremacy in Africa at large. For America, oil contracts from non-OPEC countries denominated in Bitcoin would pose significant threats.   That's why next year will be key for the future of Bitcoin. Ironically, it is the United States, the ""free market"" financial heavyweight in the world, that finds itself moving slowly to figure out how to adopt Bitcoin. Meanwhile, China is proving to be a leading player in this 21st century currency.   If the U.S. winds up over-regulating Bitcoin, the existing power structure in finance could be put at risk. The message to Congress is clear. Bitcoin is here to stay and lawmakers would do well to make sure that the U.S. does not get left behind in this brave, new digital currency world. The race is on, and Bitcoin doesn't care about national borders.

It is not managed by any central authority and is ""mined"" by solving complex math problems using powerful computers. There is also a finite amount for the number of bitcoins that will ever be in circulation.   It's been an extremely volatile year for Bitcoin, which traded at $20 in December.

Once the Cyprus crisis was resolved, Bitcoin prices crashed back to $50 later in April.   Related: London Bitcoin exchange off to a rocky start   So why is Bitcoin rallying again? The latest surge comes on the heels of strong demand in China, said Nick Colas, market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a global brokerage company based in New York.

BTC China, the leading Bitcoin exchange in China, recently surpassed Japan-based Mt. Gox last week in terms of global trading volume for the digital currency.   Related: Bitcoin flaw could let group take control of currency   Bitcoin was recently featured in favorable reports on China's state-run CCTV television network and in government-backed newspapers. It has also gained popularity since Baidu (BIDU), China's leading search engine, announced plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for some services.   ""The demand out of China has been pretty staggering,"" said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of SecondMarket, the parent company of Bitcoin Investment Trust, which was recently launched as the first U.S.-based investment fund dedicated just to Bitcoin.   ""We're seeing the early signs of money coming into Bitcoin as an asset class,"" Silbert said.   The Bitcoin Investment Trust has amassed $15 million since it launched in September. The fund had expected to end the year with $10 million, according to Silbert. ""We're seeing significant interest,"" he said.   Colas added that investors have been encouraged by recent research reports on Bitcoin from two branches of the Federal Reserve. The Chicago Fed concluded that while mainstream use of Bitcoins are still limited, the online currency is a ""remarkable conceptual and technical achievement"" that could eventually be used by banks and governments.   While it is still a very volatile currency, investors are becoming increasingly confident that Bitcoin has staying power.   ""There is some lasting value to the idea,"" said Colas. ""[Bitcoin] could have gone away after the bubble burst in April, but it didn't.""   Bitcoin mania is back! But is it a bubble?   Bitcoin is also often discussed as an alternative to gold, since many investors see the digital currency as a way to store value.   Raoul Pal, who writes the investment newsletter The Global Macro Investor, compared Bitcoin with gold to come up with a ""broad guestimate"" for how investors should value the currency.   In a report published earlier this month, Pal said that based on the supply of gold and Bitcoin, the digital currency should be worth about 700 ounces of gold, which works out to just under $900,000 at current prices.   ""I personally believe that Bitcoin may well explode in value as more and more people begin to use it,"" said Pal.   Of course, Bitcoin is still a very risky investment.  This is a modal window.   Another big concern for Bitcoin? The government recently shut down Silk Road, an online market for drugs and other illicit items, which relied on Bitcoins transactions to maintain anonymity. But several Silk Road offshoots have recently surfaced.   Senate lawmakers will hold a hearing next week to explore the pros and cons of Bitcoin.   Silbert expects Bitcoin prices to remain volatile, but he said investors who are willing to take a gamble stand to win big if Bitcoin lives up to its potential.   ""Bitcoin has the potential to completely change the way people think about money,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest ideas probably since the Internet. And as an investment opportunity, it has significant upside.""   Nonetheless, the average investor still needs to be a bit cautious. Nobody looking to buy one bitcoin for around $400 should have the realistic expectation of becoming a Bitcoin millionaire. "

The flaw is due to the nature of how bitcoins are created -- people ""mine"" them by solving a complex puzzle with their computers. If used correctly, the system is set up so that someone guesses correctly every 10 minutes, and the winner gets 25 bitcoins. Because people compete against one another for the digital currency, bitcoins are mostly evenly distributed.   But bitcoin miners could exploit a weakness in the system that would give them a greater chance of getting bitcoins than rival miners: Solving a puzzle gives miners a much higher chance of solving the next one, and those solutions are typically stored in a public log called a ""blockchain.""   But solutions don't have to be publicized. If you solve a puzzle and keep it secret, you can start working on the next one and let everyone else keep mining in the wrong spot.   That unfair advantage becomes even more apparent when selfish, secretive miners group together and pool computing resources to solve puzzles. The bigger the group, the more frequently they win. If a group gets large enough, it could take control of the currency.   Related story: London Bitcoin exchange off to a rocky start   If that happens, bitcoins wouldn't be any different than dollars, yen and yuan -- currency whose supply is controlled by a powerful, central bank. The bitcoin control group could easily drive the value of the digital currency up or down by adding or withholding bitcoins from the system.   That could disrupt the very reason many have decided to use the four-year old currency, which represented a $2.6 billion market as of Monday morning. Many libertarians like the idea of a currency that has no government backing or centralized authority.   ""No one wants to bring down Bitcoin,"" Eyal said. ""But if you know you can increase your revenue by a bit, you're going to join the selfish pool.""   Despite rampant fluctuations in in valuation, the price of bitcoins barely budged after the report was made public.  This is a modal window.   In the report, Eyal and Sirer say there already exist groups of miners that are big enough to take advantage of their selfish mining theory. And while they haven't seen anyone engage in that kind of strategy yet, it could be happening in the shadows.   Related story: Bitcoin mania is back! But is it a bubble?   As a solution, Eyal and Sirer suggest a bitcoin mining rule change: The total mining power of one group shouldn't be able to exceed one-quarter of the mining power of the bitcoin mining community as a whole. That tweak, which could be implemented with a simple software update, would prevent any one group from taking total control of the currency.   There are currently 11.9 million bitcoins in circulation. Some bitcoin users tend to get more attention, such as those illicit buyers at online black markets like the recently closed Silk Road. They tend to be drawn to the anonymous nature of the currency.   But bitcoins have also attracted some major business interests. Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese web services firm, recently started accepting bitcoin payments. And venture capital firms have begun investing in startups, like Circle Internet Financial, that make bitcoin payment tools. "

Federal agents swooped on Ross William Ulbricht in a San Francisco public library Tuesday afternoon, charging the 29-year-old American with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. They allege he is ""the Dread Pirate Roberts,"" the Silk Road's mysterious founder, who drew his pseudonym from the feared, fictitious character in the film The Princess Bride. The FBI claims the former physics and engineering student even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise on his LinkedIn profile, with a statement describing how his goals had ""shifted"" in accordance with his libertarian economic views since leaving grad school at Pennsylvania State University. Ulbricht's LinkedIn profile states that, since completing his studies in 2010, he has focused on ""creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force"" of the kind imposed by ""institutions and governments."" ""I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression (sic) amongst mankind,"" he wrote. In the indictment against Ulbricht, filed in a New York court, the FBI cyber-crime specialist who led the investigation, Christopher Tarbell, stated that he believed ""that this 'economic simulation' referred to by Ulbricht is Silk Road."" The Amazon.com of vice The FBI swiftly shuttered the site, an underground digital marketplace that, since its inception in 2011, has allowed users to anonymously trade illegal goods and services in near total secrecy, using the digital currency bitcoin, and an encryption network called Tor that routes traffic through a ""hidden"" area of the Internet known as ""the dark web."" Time.com: Online drug markets alive and thriving Tarbell said the site ""sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,"" and carried listings for hard drugs, hackers, counterfeit cash, forged ID documents, firearms, ammunition, even hitmen -- one of whom Ulbricht is alleged to have enlisted to kill a blackmailer. According to the indictment, Silk Road had acquired nearly a million registered users worldwide -- about 30% of whom were based in the U.S. -- in its two and a half years of operation, providing them guidance on how to encrypt their communications and vacuum-pack their wares before shipping through the postal service to avoid detection by law enforcement. Last year, it said, the site added a ""stealth mode"" for users who considered themselves ""at risk of becoming a target for law enforcement."" The indictment said the site had generated over 9.5 million bitcoins in sales revenue and over 600,000 bitcoins in commissions for its owner, allowing the site to employ a team of administrators. The value of bitcoins has fluctuated dramatically since the digital currency was created -- it plummeted after Ulbricht's arrest -- but Tarbell estimated Silk Road's turnover to be worth about $1.2 billion in sales, and $80 million in commissions. In February, an Australian drug dealer became the first person to be convicted in connection to Silk Road after using the site to import cocaine and MDMA from Europe. Catching the Dread Pirate Roberts In the section of the indictment outlining how the link between Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts was established, Tarbell detailed how an FBI expert codenamed Agent-1 had located an early online mention of Silk Road dating to January 27, 2011, when a user under the handle ""Altoid"" made a post on a forum for users of magic mushrooms.  ""I came across this website called Silk Road,"" wrote Altoid, in a post which linked to the site. ""I'm thinking of buying off it... Let me know what you think."" Two days later, someone using the handle ""Altoid"" made a similar post on a forum called Bitcoin Talk, recommending Silk Road and providing a link. ""Has anyone seen Silk Road yet? It's kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com. I don't think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff,"" it read. The posts, said Tarbell, were an attempt to drum up interest in Silk Road, employing the online marketing tactic of ""astroturfing."" Investigators were given a major break when, eight months later, ""Altoid"" made another posting on Bitcoin Talk, stating he was looking for ""an IT pro in the Bitcoin community"" to hire in connection with ""a venture backed Bitcoin startup company."" The posting asked interested parties to contact rossulbricht@gmail.com. The indictment also noted that Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts were both vocal adherents of the libertarian theories of Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises, with Ulbricht's public Google+ account linking to YouTube videos posted by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and Dread Pirate Roberts repeatedly crediting von Mises with ""providing the philosophical underpinnings for Silk Road."" From a San Francisco Internet cafe Tarbell said that while Dread Pirate Roberts used a ""virtual private network,"" or VPN, to create a ""false"" IP address, the VPN server's records indicated a user had accessed it from a San Francisco Internet café near the home of a friend Ulbricht had gone to live with around September last year. Records obtained from Google showed Ulbricht had regularly logged into his Gmail account from the Internet café, he said -- including on the same day in June that the VPN was accessed. In July, Ulbricht was visited in San Francisco by Homeland Security agents who had intercepted a package from Canada containing fake ID documents in nine different names, each bearing a photograph of Ulbricht.  According to the indictment, Ulbricht -- whose roommates knew him as ""Josh,"" and said he was always at home on his computer -- refused to answer questions about the IDs, but told the agents that ""hypothetically"" anyone could go on the Silk Road and purchase them.  In the weeks prior to the encounter, said Tarbell, Dread Pirate Roberts had been inquiring with Silk Road users about buying fake IDs, saying he needed them in order to rent extra servers for the site. A killing for hire? It was not the only time Ulbricht is alleged to have used the site to procure illegal services. Tarbell claimed that in March, Dread Pirate Roberts solicited the killing of a Silk Road user who was attempting to blackmail him by threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site.  The FBI alleges that the Canada-based extortionist, known as FriendlyChemist, demanded $500,000 to prevent the release of the information, prompting Dread Pirate Roberts to contact another user and order a hit on FriendlyChemist.  ""In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn't mind if he was executed,"" he is alleged to have written, before attempting to haggle down the price. ""Don't want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k.""  The FBI claims the hitman later sent a picture of the victim after the job was done -- for approximately $150,000 in bitcoins -- although Tarbell said Canadian authorities had no record of a Canadian resident with the name passed to the alleged hitman, nor any record of a homicide around that location and time. Ulbricht's lawyer, Brandon Leblanc, declined to comment on the case. Silk Road's closure is unlikely to bring an end to the trade of illegal goods on the ""dark web,"" as similar sites operate on the Tor network. "

The FBI also seized the Silk Road website, replacing its homepage with a banner noting as much, according to agency spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.   Since its 2011 inception, Silk Road has been the go-to black market for all sorts of illegal products and services. Its draw? The online marketplace offered an easy way to find goods and services -- and transact the money in secret. The site had 957,079 registered users, according to the FBI.   ""Based on my training and experience, Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,"" FBI Special Agent Christopher Tarbell said in the complaint.

To process bitcoin transactions, Silk Road used what the FBI described as a ""tumbler,"" a complex system that used countless dummy transactions to digitally conceal where the money came from.   Over the past two and a half years, the FBI said the site generated revenue worth more than 9.5 million bitcoins -- valued at $1.3 billion early Wednesday.   The FBI said Ulbricht's net worth was essentially his value in Silk Road's commissions, which totaled more than 600,000 bitcoins ($85 million).   News of the federal bust slammed the value of bitcoins on Wednesday, which tumbled from a high of $141 to below $120.   Silk Road wasn't restricted to illegal drugs. The FBI says it was also used to trade firearms, hire assassins and employ hackers.   In its Sept. 27 complaint, the FBI detailed how undercover agents used Silk Road to buy ecstasy, cocaine, heroin and LSD. They also purchased hacking software from more than 100 users. The FBI also tracked down several of Silk Road's computer servers, including one in a foreign country.   Related story: Bitcoin ATMs coming soon   To catch Ulbricht, the FBI intercepted communication sent from his account. One string of messages showed that someone in Canada tried to extort Ulbricht for $500,000 and threatened to expose several Silk Road users. In response, Ulbricht paid $150,000 to have him killed, the complaint stated. However, Canadian police told the FBI they could not locate a record of any homicide matching the name, date and location alleged in the secret discussions.   According to the complaint, Ulbricht's carelessness allowed FBI agents to track him down. The FBI said someone using the name ""altoid"" mentioned Silk Road in its earliest days within the online forum bitcointalk.org. ""Altoid"" then reappeared months later, this time looking for an ""IT pro in the Bitcoin community."" The contact information: a Gmail address with Ulbricht's full name.   Ulbricht was arrested at the Glen Park branch of the San Francisco Public Library at 3:15 p.m. PT on Tuesday.   In its raid, the FBI seized bitcoins valued at approximately $3.5 million, Langmesser said.   In its complaint, the FBI claims Ulbricht was the infamous ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" who created Silk Road. A person under that pseudonym agreed to speak to Forbes in August about the site and the vision behind it: creating a digital world that exceeds the grasp of government taxes and laws.   The FBI had worked on shuttering Silk Road and tracking down its creator since late 2011. For the investigation, the FBI teamed up with the IRS, Drug Enforcement Administration and an investigative unit of the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "

Tyler and his brother Cameron, who shared the stage, outlined the bull case for bitcoins. They have been investors and are aspiring Bitcoin entrepreneurs. The twins recently filed paperwork with the SEC for a Bitcoin exchanged traded fund.   Like gold, the virtual currency retains its value regardless of what central bankers do to the money supply. But unlike gold, bitcoins are easier and cheaper to store.   That rationale is a popular refrain among Bitcoin bulls, who are fearful of currency wars and the intervention of the Federal Reserve and other central bankers.   The presentation by the Winklevoss twins was chock full of bold proclamations on how high the price could rise, i.e. $10,000 per bitcoin. Bitcoins now trade for $140.   Cameron Winklevoss said that another sovereign debt crisis could be a catalyst for a sharp move higher.   ""We will see an implosion in the next year or two of a country's currency, and it will be bigger than Cyprus."" he said, referring to the tiny European nation. The near-implosion of Cyprus' banks and an ensuing bailout in March 2013 caused interest in the four-year old cybercurrency to surge. The price of a bitcoin eventually soared to a high of $266 in April before falling precipitously.   Related: The Winklevoss twins are Bitcoin bulls   Scary? Yes, but a rise in the currency would be a big win for the Winklevoss twins, best known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook (FB) -- as well as how the two were portrayed in the popular movie, ""The Social Network.""   Because of SEC regulations they declined to discuss plans for their ETF. But they said that the biggest hurdle to investing in bitcoins is the difficulty in purchasing them.   ""You have to be technically savvy, and there's no insurance,"" said Cameron Winklevoss, who along with Tyler, is a co-principal in Winklevoss Capital.   He added that once investors can buy bitcoins easily via an ETF similar to gold ETFs, mainstream investors will start jumping in.   But there are concerns about Bitcoin besides the volatility in the price. So far, bitcoins have proven virtually impervious to hackers, but the exchanges that trade bitcoins and the virtual wallets that hold them have been very vulnerable. Mt. Gox, the largest exchange, has had several outages.   Related: Winklevoss twins' risky Bitcoin bet   In a SEC filing, the Winklevoss brothers outlined security as a key risk factor.   In their presentation, the Winklevoss twins gave few explanations on how storage systems for the virtual currency could become safer. They also admitted that governments around the world could crack down on bitcoins but that won't stop people from using it.   ""To shut down Bitcoin is to shut down the internet,"" said Tyler Winklevoss. "

Both men pleaded not guilty Thursday and were released on bond.   Between 2006 and 2012, Callahan allegedly raised more than $118 million from at least 40 investors, misappropriating roughly $96 million, the indictment says. Among the alleged victims was a Long Island fire department said to have contributed $600,000.   Callahan is accused of diverting millions of dollars from investors to the Panoramic View, a 10-acre, 117-unit resort development in the seaside town of Montauk that prosecutors say has proven unprofitable. Callahan allegedly acquired the property along with Manson in early 2007.   Related: SEC busts alleged Bitcoin Ponzi scheme   Callahan also allegedly used investor funds for credit-card bills, luxury cars including a BMW and a Range Rover, and down payments on lavish homes in Old Westbury and Westhampton, N.Y.   Manson, who managed the Panoramic View property, is accused of aiding the fraud by lying to an auditor and helping Callahan produce fake financial documents.   Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, said the men ""used one of Long Island's landmarks, the Panoramic View Resort, to perpetrate a wide-ranging fraud.""

The SEC says 30-year-old Trendon Shavers of McKinney, Tx., took to the Internet to raise more than 700,000 bitcoins from investors between September 2011 and September 2012, a sum worth about $4.6 million based on the average daily value of the digital currency during that period.   According to the complaint, Shavers promised investors up to 7% in interest per week, but in fact was using funds from new investors to pay out the promised returns. He is also accused of converting roughly $147,000 worth of bitcoins to cover personal expenses including rent, food and gambling.   An SEC spokesman said the case was the first the agency has handled involving Bitcoin.   ""Fraudsters are not beyond the reach of the SEC just because they use Bitcoin or another virtual currency to mislead investors and violate the federal securities laws,"" Andrew Calamari, director of the SEC's New York office, said in a statement.   Shavers could not be reached for comment, and the SEC said he had yet to retain a defense lawyer.  This is a modal window.   Ironically, investors who had simply bought and held bitcoins during the period the alleged Ponzi scheme was in operation would have made a killing. While one bitcoin was worth about $6.56 on average between September 2011 and September 2012, they were valued Tuesday at $95.30 each.   Bitcoin is a four-year-old digital currency developed by a hacker who still remains anonymous. It's designed to allow worldwide payments with extremely low processing costs.   Demand for the currency surged earlier this year, pushing its value as high as $266 per bitcoin, following the unprecedented financial rescue in Cyprus in which the government raided bank deposits in excess of 100,000 euros. The move sparked fears that government-issued currencies in other countries could also be at risk, pushing many to seek a safe haven with Bitcoin.   The SEC issued an investor alert Tuesday warning of scams involving virtual currencies.   Fraudsters may plan scams using virtual currencies because they ""supposedly have greater privacy benefits and less regulatory oversight than transactions in conventional currencies,"" the agency said. It noted that all securities investments in the U.S. fall under SEC jurisdiction regardless of whether they're made in U.S. dollars or virtual currencies. "

Jessica and Sean Haley's one-year-old son, Landon, is often referred to as the first ""crowdfunded baby."" In a 2011 campaign on site Indiegogo, the Melbourne Fla., couple, raised $8,050 from more than 130 people that helped pay for their fertility treatments.   ""Twenty years ago this wouldn't have happened,"" Jessica Haley said. ""Because of the Internet, that's why we have Landon.""   Related: We're having a baby through crowdfunding!   Fertility treatments can range from an average of $865 for an intrauterine insemination (or IUI) cycle to around $8,158 for a round of the more complicated in vitro fertilization (or IVF), while the medications used between treatments can add thousands of dollars to the bill, according to non-profit RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.   Making matters worse, many couples undergo multiple procedures with no guarantee of success and insurance companies rarely pick up the bill.   Only 29% of couples polled in 2012 by RESOLVE said they had received insurance coverage to help cover infertility or adoption expenses in the past year, while more than 70% were dipping into their savings, and nearly 40% were using credit cards.   Brian Gibson and his wife Ashlee, spent close to $4,000 on doctor visits and fertility drugs before they decided to try IUI procedures, which doctors told them will cost between $1,500 and $2,000 per month.   ""We didn't know how we could afford it,"" said Ashlee Gibson, an elementary school teacher. ""I just remember going home and crying.""   After a friend suggested crowdfunding, the Mesa, Ariz., couple created ""Operation: Baby,"" a campaign on GoFundme.com in March. So far, the couple has raised $3,700 of their $10,000 goal.   Related: Adoption tax credit for same-sex couples   Couples who go the adoption route often end up paying even more, with costs ranging from $2,500 to more than $40,000 -- depending on the type of adoption, placement agency and the child's age and circumstances, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.   Typical expenses include home study costs, which entail family interviews and visits to the home, adoption agency fees and legal and court costs. International adoptions involve even more fees, as well as travel expenses.   There are ways to offset those costs. Some employers reimburse adoption expenses and there are nonprofits that offer grants. There's also a federal tax credit of nearly $13,000 per child for out-of-pocket adoption expenses. Yet many people are still intimidated by the expense, said Hank Fortener, a Los Angeles based pastor and adoption advocate.  This is a modal window.   In January 2012, Fortener founded AdoptTogether, the first nonprofit crowdfunding site devoted to adoption. So far, the site has raised $1 million for 300 adoptive families.   Thanks to the 501(c)3 status of the site's parent organization, the Hoping Hearts Foundation, all donations are tax deductible. Run by volunteers, its expenses, such as web hosting and credit card transaction fees, are paid through separate fundraising efforts so that funds designated to families go directly toward adoption expenses.   Other, more mainstream crowdfunding platforms charge transaction fees, usually around 5%, and additional credit card processing fees can apply. Donations typically aren't tax deductible.   Related: Meet the world's first Bitcoin baby   Families who don't meet their fundraising goals on AdoptTogether can apply for additional funding. And each family is still required to apply for financial grants through the foundation, providing detailed documentation for each expense, Fortener said.   More than 100 families who have used the site already have their children at home with them, according to Fortener.   About six months after creating an AdoptTogether page last year, Bill and Nicole Radtke raised $23,000, which covered almost all of the estimated $26,000 they needed to adopt their son Manny, who was born in October.   ""It's just amazing how much people wanted to be a part of Manny's story,"" Nicole Radtke said. "

So far, bitcoins have proven virtually impervious to hackers, but the exchanges that trade bitcoins and the virtual wallets that hold them have been very vulnerable.   Unsurprisingly, one of the key risk factors noted in the SEC filing is security.   Related: The Winklevoss twins are Bitcoin bulls   The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust admits its proprietary security system might not be safe enough, and it may not be able to keep up with new and changing technological threats. ""The loss or destruction of a private key required to access a Bitcoin may be irreversible.""   The ETF plans to offer an index that tracks the blended price of bitcoins across multiple exchanges.   ""Even the largest Bitcoin Exchanges have been subject to operational interruption, resulting in volatile prices and a reduction in confidence,"" the filing says.   Mt. Gox, the largest exchange, has had several outages. And prices have dropped 66% after surging to a record high of $266 in April.  This is a modal window.   The Winklevoss twins, also called the Winklevii, finally settled their Facebook lawsuit in 2008, and walked away with $148 million worth of Facebook stock based on today's stock price. (It's unclear whether they have sold any of their shares).   The twins admitted that training with the U.S. Olympic rowing team and spending seven years litigating their Facebook claim are not the best qualifications for operating an investment fund.   ""As the Sponsor and its management have no history of operating an investment vehicle like the Trust, their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the Trust,"" they said in their filing.   But that's not holding them back.   The twins have been bulking up on bitcoins over the last year. They told the New York Times in April that they started ""dabbling"" in bitcoins last summer, and recently they took a stake in Bitcoin payment processor BitInstant.   Related: Bitcoin prices surge post-Cyprus bailout    Another risk listed in the filing is whether retailers will begin widely accepting bitcoins for payments. A number of retailers have started accepting bitcoins, but so far, the amount of business generated by the currency has been negligible.   Bitcoins are still largely a speculators game. But even if they keep playing, it's not clear whether there will be enough volume to justify an active trading market.   The virtual currency was created to be free from government or central bank intervention, which has proven to be easier said than done.   U.S. regulators have been scrutinizing the cybercurrency and if regulators start to crack down, the prices could once again become increasingly volatile.   Adding to the pile of risks is the question of how to tax bitcoins, which the filing says is ""uncertain"" and ""complex.""   The risks to going public are huge, but should they make it, Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss may finally be able to watch their company's stock open for trading on a major exchange.   Hopefully it will do better than Facebook's debut. "

Michael Mancil Brown, 34, of Franklin is charged with six counts of wire fraud and six counts of extortion. It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Brown had an attorney. According to the indictment, Brown claimed he had accessed the computer network of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and stolen tax returns for Romney and his wife, Ann, for some tax years before 2010. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns and refused to release others. The issue was a source of controversy on the campaign trail. Brown allegedly was behind an August 2012 letter sent to the accounting firm demanding that $1 million in the digital currency Bitcoin be deposited to a specified Bitcoin account or else the Romney returns would be made public. The author of the letter also sent a flash drive that he claimed contained encrypted files of some of the Romneys' taxes. Another letter addressed to ""Interested Parties Worldwide"" said those who wanted to see the records made public should contribute $1 million to a different Bitcoin account. Letters also were sent to Democratic and Republican party offices in Franklin. The indictment said Brown also posted on the website Pastebin.com a September 20, 2012, message claiming he had found a buyer for the tax information. The court document said the web postings included the phrase ""Greetings from Dr. Evil,"" an apparent reference to the character in the Austin Powers spy spoof movies."
595,595,2013: The state of the startups,http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/24/tech/innovation/state-of-startups/index.html,"Jun 24, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"Startup. The term, near ubiquitous in our app-consuming, fully Facebooked world, is one that didn't truly enter the lexicon until the 1990s, when Wall Street took a bow to Silicon Valley and the palate of professional possibility became wired and well-connected. Much has changed since then. Gone are the days when any 20-something with a computer science degree could dream of a bidding war for their talents, followed by a six-figure salary and free lattes in offices where chair massages and nap rooms are the norm. No longer do investors throw millions at anything with dotcom at the end of its name, and many of those early pioneers -- who gambled that we were ready to buy pet supplies or order our groceries from an awkward adolescent called the internet -- are no more. But the spirit lives on, in dorm rooms and garages, shared offices and coffee shops with WiFi. It's a fragmented, competitive and constantly changing world. But in 2013, the state of the startup is strong. Today, CNN Tech highlights that world with CNN 10: Startups. Our inaugural list looks at 10 emerging companies we think are poised to make a splash in the coming months with new and innovative ideas in fields such as medicine, computing, transportation and video games. Now more than ever, computing and technology move fast, and the best technology startups are the ones that get in on a trend before it blows up.  There are a few hot categories on the horizon for consumer technology, including collaborative consumption and the sharing economy, the so-called Internet of Things, crowdsourcing, 3-D printing and the maker movement. Older institutions like education, finance and health care are also undergoing big changes, with online courses, BitCoin and peer-to-peer lending. The biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley are busy putting money into promising startups making their mark in these fields.  Services that tap into the sharing economy are closest to being mainstream. Ride-sharing service Lyft, home-rental site Airbnb and labor marketplace TaskRabbit, are taking off around the world, catching on one city at a time.  These startups are focused on using resources more efficiently -- filling empty car seats, bedrooms and hours of the day in exchange for money.  ""Most people on all of the services are both hosts and users, so it's a two-way market, which makes this very exciting,"" said Brian Singerman of the Founders Fund, a San Francisco venture capital firm. ""This is for the masses; it's not just for rich people who want to use a service."" Some of the startup world's cooler emerging gadgets fall under the umbrella of the Internet of Things. Smaller sensors mean that everyday objects will soon be collecting data about your life and habits.   This category already has some big successes, like the Nest smart thermostat and wearable fitness devices. The field is still young, but it will grow exponentially as more objects get connected. ""The value of a fax machine is more valuable when another fax machine gets on the network,"" said Navin Chaddha of the Mayfield Fund. ""Massive opportunities are going to be created."" The way we use and interact with our computers is also changing, with devices that use gestures and movement to control what's on a screen, like the MYO wristband and the Leap Motion controller. ""What Leap Motion is trying to do is make the interface between man and machine disappear,"" said Singerman, whose company is an investor in Leap. In 2013, though, a successful startup might be one you'll never hear about. Chris Dixon, of Andreessen Horowitz, says historically 80% of venture capital investments are in enterprise technology -- the companies that build the behind-the-scenes technology like networks and storage.  You don't hear about these companies as much because they can be technically complicated, but without them the consumer apps, services and gadgets wouldn't exist. For these companies, a happy ending may be when the Oracles, Googles, Facebooks and Microsofts of the world come calling, offering a big-dollar buyout. But nothing is certain in startups. For every Mark Zuckerberg in a dorm room or pair of Steves (Wozniak and Jobs) in a garage, there are many ventures that, despite good ideas and hard work, never take hold. And it could be a while before even the best products being developed today show up in a Best Buy or the hottest tech trends have any meaningful impact on the lives of the average consumer.  ""One of the hardest things in technology,"" said Dixon, ""is predicting when these things are going to happen."""
596,596,Meet the world's first Bitcoin baby,http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/10/technology/innovation/bitcoin-baby/index.html,"Jun 10, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," No, this isn't a black-market deal brokered in the Internet's shadowy corners. The child was born thanks to a frozen embryo transfer cycle paid for with bitcoins. Lee says it's the first time he's aware of that anyone has paid for fertility treatments that way.   The baby is the biggest -- and definitely the cutest -- victory yet for Lee in his campaign to persuade his patients to pay him for his services with bitcoins, the experimental digital currency that caught Wall Street's attention recently when its trading price shot up.   There are 11 million bitcoins in circulation right now with a collective ""market value"" of around $1.4 billion. You can spend bitcoins online at shops like BitcoinStore.com, but they're not exactly a mainstream currency for everyday transactions.   Lee would love to change that. He's an early pioneer in the Bitcoin retail economy, and a sign on his clinic door advertises his accepted forms of electronic payment: Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) or Bitcoin.   The sign alone hasn't generated any business, Lee admits.   ""We see 10 to 40 patients a day, and nobody even bothered to ask what the sign meant,"" he said in recent presentation at Bitcoin 2013, a conference dedicated to the fledgling currency.   So Lee escalated. Determined to find a patient willing to pay him in bitcoins, Lee put an ad up on Reddit last year offering a ""male fertility evaluation"" -- basically, a sperm test -- in return for 15 bitcoins, which at the time were worth around $5 each.   The customer who finally took up the offer didn't actually care about his sperm count, Lee said. He just wanted to participate in what may have been the world's first bitcoin-funded medical transaction. (""It turned out he had really good sperm!"" Lee said happily while recounting the deal.)   Lee is something of an accidental Bitcoin evangelist. An ob/gyn with a geeky streak, he came across Bitcoin around a year ago while poking around on the Internet. The community's passion drew him in.   ""I thought it was interesting -- people supporting it as a way for the common man to take back hold of finance,"" Lee told CNNMoney after his talk. ""I was like, 'OK, let me support them.' And then I became part of them.""   It took a few months to find his sperm-test guinea pig. After that, Lee grew bolder. He broached the subject with a few of his clients. If he offered a big discount, he asked, would they consider paying him with bitcoins?   ""In some cases they reacted like I said I wanted to be paid in vials of crack cocaine,"" he recalled.   Related story: How porn links and Ben Bernanke snuck into Bitcoin's code   Eventually, though, a few agreed to try it out. And then he hit the jackpot: A couple whom he helped conceive three previous babies came back to try for number four.   ""They said, 'Dr. Lee, we don't understand this Bitcoin thing,' but bless their hearts, they were willing to play along out of loyalty,"" he said. ""I offered them a 50% discount.""   But actually completing a large bitcoin transaction isn't as simple as slapping down a credit card.   Lee's clients owed him around $1,000 for his services. Lee had to do some digging to find out where they could safely send off such a large sum of cash and have it converted into bitcoins.   ""There were nowhere near as many options then as there are today,"" he says of his experience late last year. ""It was like the blind leading the blind.""   Lee picked CryptoXChange -- a now-defunct exchange service based in Australia -- and helped his clients create and fund their account, using the international money-transfer services of a local bank. The entire process took several days.   In the end, it paid off on all fronts: Lee got his bitcoins, and the fertility treatment worked.   Bitcoin's volatility has worked in Lee's favor, so far. The 30 bitcoins he collected for aiding in Baby #4's conception are now worth around $3,600 -- easily offsetting the heavy discount he offered.   What goes up, though, can also crash. In April, the value of 1 Bitcoin briefly hit a record high of $266 before plunging back to $165 just hours later. For merchants that rely on their sales for cash flow, that kind of volatility is a huge risk.   Lee claims he wouldn't care if his bitcoins lost their value entirely -- he and his staff are having fun figuring out the technology, meeting new people, and enjoying the economic novelty of a whole new kind of currency. He's even managed to convert a few more of his clients.   ""On the Friday before I came here, we did an ultrasound on a patient who paid with bitcoin,"" he said at the Bitcoin conference. ""We may also have the world's first bitcoin twins."" "
597,597,Bitcoin more powerful than fastest supercomputers,http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/enterprise/bitcoin-supercomputers/index.html,"May 23, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"This is a modal window.   The power of all the computers networked together to maintain the digital currency's system far exceeds the combined processing strength of the top 500 most powerful supercomputers.   Easily. The matchup isn't even close.   There have been lots of stories about Bitcoin in the past few months thanks to its rapid price rise -- from $5 a year ago for 1 bitcoin to a record high of $266 in April, before falling back to around $122 today.   Bitcoin's price moves attract the most interest, but the system's infrastructure is its most fascinating aspect. The crypto currency dreamed up in 2009 by a still-anonymous hacker is now one of the world's most expansive large-scale computing pioneers.   At any given moment, Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network contains thousands of computers linked together to generate more than 1,000 petaflops of raw computing power. To put that in perspective, the world's fastest supercomputer, Titan, runs at less than 18 petaflops. The Bitcoin network is sucking down nearly $200,000 a day in electricity costs, according to one tracking site's estimate.   That's stunning for an ""economy"" that sprang into being just four years ago, when an inventor using the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" released the system's source code on a cryptography mailing list.   Related story: You can spend bitcoins at your local mall   Nakamoto built in an ingenious lure to draw in computing power. Bitcoins are ""created"" in batches every 10 minutes by an algorithm designed to eventually release a finite total of 21 million bitcoins. So far, 11 million have been released. The final coin won't be minted until 2140.   Computers compete to get hold of those new bitcoins by solving mathematical problems of increasing complexity. Whoever does it first gets the coins.   Those same computers maintain Bitcoin's ""blockchain,"" the public ledger that stores and verifies all of Bitcoin's transaction records. As the network grows more powerful, so do the safeguards that prevent Bitcoin's economy from being manipulated -- or erased.   Related story: Strategist predicts end of Bitcoin   In the early days, a standard PC could successfully ""mine"" for coins and occasionally snag a handful. Today, mining is dominated by pros running custom-built computers with stunning amounts of power. It's essentially an arms race, and the weapons have escalated fast.   So have the stakes they're playing for. At $122 per coin, the 3,600 coins ""minted"" each day are collectively worth more than $430,000. The entire Bitcoin ""economy"" has a market cap of nearly $1.4 billion.   That kind of cash has drawn new players into the fold.  This is a modal window.   Two venture capital firms announced dedicated Bitcoin funds last week, and several others unveiled multimillion-dollar investments in buzzed-about startups like BitPay ($2 million from Founders Fund) and BitInstant ($1.5 million, led by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook (FB) fame).   ""This isn't a bubble or tulip mania,"" said Tyler Winklevoss in a keynote talk at last weekend's Bitcoin 2013, a conference that brought together more than 1,000 Bitcoin developers, speculators, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts. ""This is rapid adoption. This is a rush.""   Keeping up with the rush will be the big challenge this year. Bitcoin's growth is stress-testing the system in unprecedented ways. A key concern? The volume of bitcoin transactions -- currently hovering around 60,000 per day -- is doubling roughly every four months. If it doubles a few more times, the system will run up against a built-in technical limit that requires significant changes to overcome.   Related story: Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox lands in feds' crosshairs   Gavin Andersen, the Bitcoin system's lead developer, estimates that point is only a year or so away.   He's also confident that the Bitcoin ecosystem is resilient enough to handle it. The Bitcoin project has been full of ""chaos and drama"" ever since he's been involved, but it hasn't yet derailed the experiment, Andersen said in a ""state of the union"" talk at the Bitcoin conference.   He said he's excited to see what Bitcoin will become with the fresh infusion of entrepreneurs and developers that the currency's rising visibility has drawn into the community.   ""We've been on a roller coaster ride,"" Andersen said. ""I expect, at least for the next few years, we're going to remain on a roller coaster ride."" "
598,598,The Winklevoss twins are Bitcoin bulls,http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/18/investing/winklevoss-bitcoin/index.html,"May 18, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," A few months ago, word spread that the twins, Cameron and Tyler, had set up their own investment firm and decided to focus on a curious market niche: bitcoins.   The brothers are betting that the cyber currency can turn them from millionaires into billionaires. They've invested in buying the coins directly (they told the New York Times that they began ""dabbling"" last summer, when prices were in the single digits), and this week, they disclosed their first Bitcoin venture investment: A stake in New York-based payment processor BitInstant.   The Winklevii, as they're known around town, gave a keynote talk Friday night at Bitcoin 2013, a conference in San Jose, Calif., bringing together Bitcoin developers, miners, investors and enthusiasts.   The presentation was light on specifics but heavy on bullishness, as the brothers charted the currency's rapid rise and explained why they believe it's got much further to go.   The price of 1 bitcoin has risen from $5 a year ago to a record high of $266 in April. It currently hovers around $120 per coin, setting the combined value for all 11 million bitcoins in existence at just shy of $1.4 billion.  This is a modal window.   ""This isn't a bubble or tulip mania,"" Tyler told the crowd of several hundred attendees. ""This is rapid adoption. This is a rush.""   Ideological underpinnings aside, Bitcoin has two key selling points as a payment system: Anonymity and much lower transaction fees than rival digital systems like credit cards. The twins believe that bitcoins can transform the payments industry the way that Skype and other VoIP (voice over IP) services demolished the long-distance calling market.   They're eying payment processing services like BitInstant as a way to take the currency mainstream. Winklevoss Capital recently led a $1.5 million financing round for the two-year-old firm.   So when a bitcoin-focused startup takes on venture capital cash, how does it do it: Traditional money or actual bitcoins?   ""American dollars,"" says David Azar, a private investor who participated in the round. ""Only American dollars."" "

The move sent a brief chill through the Bitcoin community, though some enthusiasts shrugged it off as an inevitable consequence of the cyber currency's growing public profile. A few even defended the feds. ""This isn't the government trying to kill anything,"" one commenter wrote on Reddit's Bitcoin discussion board. ""This is them locking accounts because they didn't file the right paperwork.""   Mt. Gox is by far the biggest exchange in the Bitcoin economy, handling about 66% of all currency conversions.   The drama started on Tuesday, when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security obtained a warrant to seize the contents of Mt. Gox's account with Dwolla, a payment processing network based in Des Moines, Iowa.   Dwolla is one of the key services used by Tokyo-based Mt. Gox to let its American customers convert U.S. dollars into bitcoins and vice versa. The company stopped processing transactions to and from Mt. Gox's account after it received the warrant and tried to distance itself from the dispute.  This is a modal window.   ""We've informed the users that we believe were most immediately affected by the action, but literally have no additional information or insight on the matter,"" spokesman Jordan Lampe told CNNMoney.   Mt. Gox said it is investigating the matter. In the meantime, it posted a statement saying U.S. customers will only be able to deposit and withdraw funds with an international money order or by using OKPay, an international currency conversion system.   Related: How porn links snuck into Bitcoin's code   Will any customers lose funds? That's currently unclear. Federal officials now presumably have control of any funds that were sitting in the account's coffers, as well as a Wells Fargo account that was also targeted.   DHS declined to comment on its investigation, but it provided several news outlets, including CNNMoney, with a copy of its seizure warrant.   According to the document, Mt. Gox's U.S. subsidiary set up a Wells Fargo (WFC) business account in May 2011. At the time, the company filled out a ""money services business"" questionnaire and said it was not a firm that dealt in or exchanged money for its customers.   Not so, say the feds. Because U.S. dollars can be passed back and forth on Mt. Gox through bitcoin conversions, they consider the site's operations to be a ""money transmitting activity.""   Related: Feds crack down on Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange   The crackdown comes less than two months after the U.S. government issued new rules saying that virtual currency exchanges will be subject to the same kinds of anti-money laundering rules that banks have to follow.

Last week, bitcoin payment processor BitPay announced a deal with Gyft, a seven-month-old Google Ventures-backed software app that lets users buy and upload retail gift cards to Android-based smartphones.   The partnership will allow customers to use bitcoins to buy gift cards for stores such as Gap (GPS), Lowe's (LOW), Sephora, GameStop (GME), Burger King (BKW) and over 200 other retailers.   While those stores won't handle the bitcoin transactions themselves -- that's done by Gyft and BitPay -- it brings the number of locations where customers can effectively pay with bitcoins from around 8,000 nationwide to over 50,000, according to BitPay co-founder and CEO Tony Gallippi.   ""This really does open the door to retail use of Bitcoin,"" said Gallippi. ""I think it will drive adoption.""   There's no doubt that four-year-old cyber currency Bitcoin is attracting more mainstream attention. For evidence of that, just look at Bitcoin's soaring -- and volatile -- valuation. The worth of 1 bitcoin zoomed from $20 at the start of the year to $266 in April. It's now worth about $117.   What's harder to say is if people area actually using bitcoins to buy stuff.   One of the more prominent merchants to start taking bitcoins, blog hosting site Wordpress, is keeping mum on the matter.   Related: Strategist predicts end of Bitcoin    Wordpress' move to accept bitcoins ""was fueled more by curiosity than by profit,"" a company spokeswoman told CNNMoney. She wouldn't say how many customers had used them, but she did confirm that at least a few people had paid with bitcoins.   Online community Reddit, another high-profile acceptor of bitcoins, said about 5% of its premium membership sales are now paid via Bitcoin.   At Stomp Romp, a New Hampshire-based online guitar retailer, owner Zach Harvey said that a growing number of people are paying with bitcoins, but he estimated that it's still less than 1% of his businesses. He began accepting bitcoins in 2011.    Harvey -- a die-hard libertarian -- remains bullish on the currency. Another company he's involved with is working to help roll out Bitcoin ATMs. He attributes his lackluster Bitcoin sales at Stomp Romp to the fact that ""guitar fans aren't really tech geeks.""   Bitcoins have been a giant hit for at least one merchant: New York City bar EVR has logged more than $26,000 in Bitcoin sales since it started taking the currency just over a month ago. That's about 10% of the bar's overall revenue.  This is a modal window.   ""I've been pleasantly surprised,"" said EVR co-owner Alex Likhtenstein.   Likhtenstein said paying with bitcoins is easy. The servers present the customer with a bill on a tablet that has a bar code attached. The customer scans the bar code with a smartphone, and the amount in bitcoins is subtracted from their account.   He likes the fact that he gets paid faster with bitcoins than with credit cards. Plus, the processing fees are lower.   ""To a business owner, it has only positives,"" he said.  "

He thinks that bigger players will enter the field and improve upon Bitcoin's weaknesses.   Bitcoins are a virtual currency that was created by an anonymous hacker just four years ago. Investors who have bought up the currency as an alternative to traditional government-backed currencies have been on a wild ride this year.   Bitcoins traded high as $266 from $20 at the start of the year. After dipping back to $60 in late April, the price of one bitcoin is currently hovering around $120.   Related: How porn links and Ben Bernanke snuck into Bitcoin's code   Investors have turned to bitcoins for two reasons. During the banking crisis in Cyprus in March, bank depositors were nearly forced to take sharp haircuts and struggled to gain access to their accounts. The banking drama in Cyprus sparked fears of bank runs around the world and made investors think a virtual currency might be safer.   Separately investors are becoming increasingly concerned about what central bank intervention could mean for the safety of traditional currencies. Three years into the Federal Reserve's unprecedented intervention into the financial markets, the Bank of Japan launched its own bond buying program that's roughly three times the size of the Fed's. The yen has weakened dramatically as a result.   But Bitcoin has been the victim of a different type of intervention -- from hackers. The currency itself is nearly impenetrable to hackers, but the digital wallets that house bitcoins have been infiltrated. One of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfloor, was shut down in April, after it was attacked.   ""Bitcoin has lost a lot of credibility from the hacking and all this volatility,"" said Bremmer.   Bremmer thinks a wide variety of virtual currencies will pop up over the next several years. He says company-backed currencies will be one type. Think American Express (AXP) points or frequent flier miles from airlines.   Related: Hedge fund manager says Fed should rev up 'printing press'   ""People can buy things with Amex points. That's a real kind of currency that's created by American Express to allow them to have a greater piece of consumption that they otherwise wouldn't get,"" said Bremmer.   Amazon (AMZN) launched its own currency called Coins Monday, which allows Amazon customers to purchase apps or games from the Kindle or the Amazon Appstore. Facebook (FB) has something similar called Facebook Credits.  This is a modal window.   But paper money and coins aren't going anywhere yet, Bremmer said.   ""Don't underestimate the importance of cash,"" he said. ""Cash facilitates corruption, and there are many governments out there that want to be able to avoid paper trails on every transaction they engage in.""   Globally, the cash that works for these transactions is the dollar, often the $100 bill.   ""This is not insignificant for helping the U.S. as the global reserve currency,"" Bremmer said. "

The doors to the Omaha stadium had opened half an hour early at 6.30am, and he was asked if this could not be a permanent adjustment to the timeworn schedule of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Thousands of investors had queued in the Nebraskan drizzle to claim seats close to Mr Buffett and Charlie Munger, his vice-chairman, and when the octogenarians arrived onstage two hours later, more than 20,000 had packed in to hear their answers. The interrogation remained friendly. A year ago, discontent rumbled at the level of the conglomerate's share price, but on Friday it had reached a record $160,294 per A share. With a $268bn market capitalisation, Mr Buffett reported, to applause, that Berkshire was the world's fifth-largest company. The investor has spent half a century accumulating more than 70 companies in sectors ranging from candy bars and corporate jets to insurance and cargo trains, and as his company has grown, so have the crowds of pilgrims drawn to Omaha. Susie Buffett, daughter of Warren, said that an old school friend was attending for the first time. ""She remembers my dad in his bathrobe making Jiffy pop in the kitchen, and I keep telling her that you have got to come, you are not going to believe how weird this is."" Many come because there may not be many more and, in a world of online real time updates, it is the rare event where recording and broadcasting are simply not allowed. The message is unchanging: buy stocks at the right price, be optimistic, trust Warren. But shareholders said that hearing it each year was a mental reset, a reminder of a particular approach to investing that acolytes try to follow. If there was a downbeat message, it was a familiar one that Berkshire's size meant future growth must be slower, ""because of course our past returns were almost unbelievable"", said Mr Munger. The two men also warned that bond-buying by the Federal Reserve would have unpredictable consequences. Mr Buffett said: ""It's been a very smart policy, but the unwind of it has got to be more difficult than buying."" He said that when inflation did pick up for the first time, ""it's likely to be the shot heard round the world"", but he could not predict when it would happen and said it ""doesn't mean the world will end"". On his own company, Mr Buffett had for the first time invited along a bear on the stock to provide bite. Doug Kass of the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners, who has taken a short position on Berkshire, gamely probed Mr Buffett about what happens after his death, when his son will take over as chairman: ""Other than accident of birth, how is he qualified?"" Yet Mr Kass -- describing himself as ""Daniel in the lion's den"" in front of Mr Buffett's thousands of friends -- served more as straight man setting up lines for the crowd favourites. The billionaire shot back that Mr Kass was welcome to bring his own friends along next time. The Oracle could not be swayed from the script. His son would be non-executive chairman to safeguard the company's culture, he said, in case the successor turned out be the wrong choice. Mr Buffett said he and his board knew who that person would be, even if they would not say, and change after he had gone would be minimal: perhaps the Omaha head office might hire a 24th employee. The meeting slipped into an easy rhythm, alternating between the merits of individual Berkshire business, thoughts on fads such as online currency -- ""of our $49bn [of cash] we haven't moved any to Bitcoin"", said Mr Buffett -- and requests for advice. The insurance business was a favourite, particularly Geico, its consumer brand. But Mr Buffett also revealed that four top insurance executives he recently poached from AIG to build a commercial insurance business had approached Berkshire about the move. ""It could be a business that reaches into the billions,"" Mr Buffett said. ""We've got the right people. We've got capital like no one else."" Asked to name his 10 favourite books, Mr Buffett returned to the one that most influenced him: Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis, the value investors' Bible. After more than four hours of such answers, most investors seemed to relish hearing the thoughts of the men in person. Patrick Wolff, of Grandmaster Capital, said: ""There really is nothing else like this on the planet, and who knows how long it will keep going."""
603,603,How porn links and Ben Bernanke snuck into Bitcoin's code,http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/02/technology/security/bitcoin-porn/index.html,"May 3, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Bitcoin, a four-year-old digital currency developed by a hacker who still remains anonymous, is a favorite plaything of libertarians and cryptography geeks. It burst into the mainstream this year when investors took note of its wild price swings. One bitcoin is now worth around $112, down from a record high of $266 last month, but up from $5 a year ago.   At the core of the bitcoin network is a database recording every single transaction.   Bitcoin enthusiasts have long known about a technical loophole that allows people to inject coded messages into the database. The trick is typically used for pranks or harmless notes, but Bitcoin discussion boards lit up on Monday with the news that someone took advantage of it for a nastier purpose: adding encoded links that claim to lead to porn sites, some featuring children. (CNNMoney verified that the links exist in Bitcoin's database, but did not check to see if they actually went to child porn sites.)   A technical analysis posted on BitcoinTalk.org delves into the details. There doesn't seem to be much danger for the casual bitcoin user. The porn links are concealed in hexadecimal code, and a decoder is needed to translate them into English. In other words, you'd really have to be looking for it.   But once a message makes it into the Bitcoin ledger, it can't be removed.   ""There are very large ramifications to filtering out transactions, even ones that are obviously data spam,"" Jeff Garzik, a developer who works on Bitcoin's core software, wrote in a blog post responding to the porn discovery.  This is a modal window.   People have been sneaking messages into the ledger for years. Bitcoin's creator put a coded note into the very first recorded transaction, and in 2011, a crafty hacker embedded a tribute to a recently deceased friend, along with a rather accurate, pixelated image of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Religious tracts, spam and random pronouncements like ""I LIKE TURTLES"" are some of the notes that turned up in 2012 file showing some of the encoded text. Last month, someone dropped in a large stash of Wikileaks cables.   But all this monkeying with the ledger is posing a problem for the pioneering currency, just as it's beginning to gain wider attention. Bitcoin advocates have worried for years about what would happen if someone tried to store illegal content in the ledger -- like, say, child porn, which is a U.S. federal crime to possess. That once-hypothetical threat is now real.   The porn: Every bitcoin user interacts with a portion of the currency's database, and many power users run software that stores the entire thing. Legally, bitcoin users who have the part of the ledger with the porn links seem to be in the clear. They are, after all, just words and text links -- not actual child porn images.   The U.S. Justice Department wouldn't comment on this specific case, but an agency spokesman pointed CNNMoney to the exact wording of the law, which states that the issue becomes a crime when a person ""knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view"" child porn. It doesn't appear that an unsuspecting user with these coded links sitting on their hard drive has much to worry about.   So is this a big deal or not? The Bitcoin community is divided.   Some think the links are being blown way out of proportion. They liken the coded messages in Bitcoin's ledger to graffiti, and say it's inevitable that someone would eventually inject something unsavory.   ""All tech can be abused for weird stuff,"" Dan Kaminsky, the hacker who pulled off the Bernanke stunt in 2011, told CNNMoney.   Others would like Bitcoin's core developers to take action. ""This is actually a big issue,"" one commenter wrote in a discussion thread on Hacker News. ""I don't think we should avoid it.""   Related story: 'I lost $50,000 in Bitcoin crash'   Bitcoin's backers appear to be taking this seriously.   ""It is an awful situation,"" the developer Garzik told CNNMoney. ""The problem goes to the core of digital currency storage.""   Because bitcoin transactions are anonymous, it's difficult to trace a malicious transaction back to its source. Theories about why someone would put the porn links in run the gamut. Perhaps it's anti-child porn activists who want the authorities to take more action. Perhaps it's people trying to shut down Bitcoin, or a group hoping to make money off a crash in the currency. It might just be pranksters looking for trouble.   Most of Bitcoin's users don't think it's actual pedophiles trying to distribute their contraband. There are better, more secure ways to store information, and injecting the porn links cost the perpetrator $50 or $60 in transaction fees.   Already, new versions of Bitcoin's core software are being developed that allow historical transactions to eventually be deleted.   ""Once people get the idea that it's not a way to force lots of people to store your data forever, interest in it will go away,"" said Mike Hearn, a Bitcoin developer. ""There might be occasional graffitis here or there, but we can tolerate that.""  This is a modal window.   Another way to head off problems like this would be to increase the fees charged by bitcoin transaction processors, since these ""data spam"" interludes generally require dozens or hundreds of small transactions to complete. Or Bitcoin's network could start weeding out people who are making a rapid series of tiny transactions.   But both these options diminish some of Bitcoin's biggest selling points to begin with: its low transaction fees and lack of central authority.   ""The answer is very complex,"" Garzik wrote in his blog post, ""with implications that travel to the heart of Bitcoin's value."" "

The Dow closed slightly higher despite concerns about the health of tech giant IBM (IBM). Shares of IBM, which carries the biggest weighting in the Dow, dropped more than 6% Friday following weak earnings.   Yet the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ticked higher, gaining 0.9% and 1.3% respectively.   Mixed bag of earnings reports: Some of the world's biggest companies handed investors big surprises, but they offered no easy takeaways about the health of corporate America.   ""No broader trend has emerged yet,"" said BTIG's chief market strategist Dan Greenhaus. ""A lot of what we have seen is company specific.""   Related: Fear & Greed Index stuck in fear    Take industrials. General Electric (GE) spooked investors by noting its big backlog of equipment and services. Its stock fell 4%.   Yet, appliance maker Honeywell (HON) reported an increase in first-quarter earnings, pushing up its stock price by 4%.   And Big Macs are not so hot. McDonald's (MCD) shares dropped after the hamburger maker noted a decline in same-store sales.   But Chipotle (CMG) -- one of hedge fund manager David Einhorn's least favorite stocks -- rose more than 10%. The Mexican food chain reported earnings that showed increases in revenue, income and same-store sales.  This is a modal window.   The contrasting reports continued in the tech sector. While IBM fell drastically, other tech stocks fared better. Microsoft (MSFT) got a big boost in its latest earnings report from strong Windows 8 sales.   Google (GOOG) earnings topped estimates, even as the search giant faces challenges with how to make money off mobile ads and its Motorola smartphone unit.   Analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise by 2% for the first quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. But earnings season is far from over. So far, 104 S&P 500 companies have reported, with 70 beating forecasts, 23 missing and 11 coming in in line.   Apple, Dell and other M&A news: Shares of  Apple (AAPL), which have been in freefall lately, closed slightly lower, hitting another new 52-week low.   Meanwhile, Dell's (DELL) stock slid more than 3% following reports that Blackstone (BX) had dropped its bid to buy the PC company.   Shares of PepsiCo (PEP) and Mondelez (MDLZ) rose 2% and 5% respectively, after activist investor Nelson Peltz raised his stake in PepsiCo, according to an SEC filing. Peltz, who also holds a stake in Mondelez, is expected to push for a merger between the two, or some sort of combination of their food and snack businesses. PepsiCo said that it has been meeting with Peltz's Trian fund to reevaluate its business.   A mega beer merger received the Department of Justice's blessing. The DOJ agreed to allow the merger of Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) and Grupo Modelo after Modelo sells certain U.S. assets to Constellation Brands (STZ).

That's more than double this week's low of $50.   Trading volume doubled in just two hours.   The price of the virtual currency, which was created by an anonymous hacker just four years ago, has increased almost 20-fold this year. It gained particular attention in the wake of a mini-bank run in Cyprus, which had raised concerns about the health of government-backed paper currencies like the euro and the U.S. dollar.   As traders and investors jumped on the bandwagon, prices spiked to $266.   The rush of activity led Mt. Gox, a Japan-based exchange that claims to handle 80% of Bitcoin trade worldwide, to halt trading.   Prices came down sharply when trading resumed, leading to speculation about whether the Bitcoin bubble had finally burst.

There hasn't been any one catalyst pushing stocks higher lately. Mostly, investors just don't want to miss the next leg up.

Related: Investors are back with a vengeance   Duo of disappointing economic reports. Retail sales dropped 0.4% in March, marking a sluggish start to the shopping season. Sales were primarily dragged down by weakness in electronics and gasoline prices. Economists were expecting sales to be unchanged from February.   Consumer confidence also came in below forecasts. The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on consumer confidence for April fell to 72.3 from 78.6 last month. Economists were expecting the index to barely slip to 78.   The Producer Price Index slid 0.6% in March, a more dramatic drop than the 0.1% economists had forecast. That's another sign that inflation is not a problem right now.   Commodities get crushed: Gold prices sank 4% to $1,501 an ounce amid speculation that Cyprus may sell its excess amount of gold as part of its bailout.   Crude oil prices tumbled more than 2%, falling to $91.29 a barrel.   Commodities were also pressured by the dollar, which gained strength against the euro and the British pound. Commodities, including oil and gold, are priced in U.S. dollars, so a firmer greenback typically weighs on prices.   Bitcoin bubble begins to burst: The price of a Bitcoin, a virtual currency craze that many speculated was a bubble, has tumbled more than 70% over the past two days.

At about 10 a.m. ET Thursday, trading was halted on Mt.Gox, a Japan-based exchange that claims to handle 80% of Bitcoin trade worldwide. The price at that time was already at about $123, down more than 50% from the peak.   Mt.Gox issued a statement Friday attributing both the pre-halt price fall and the halt in trading to the rush of new customers trying to trade in the electronic currency.   ""The rather astonishing amount of new accounts opened in the last few days...made a huge impact on the overall system that started to lag,"" the exchange said. ""As expected in such situations, people started to panic, started to sell Bitcoin in mass...resulting in an increase of trade that ultimately froze the trade engine.""

The surge was triggered by the botched European Union bailout of Cyprus, and has attracted users who are concerned about the health of government-backed paper currencies like the euro and dollar.   Related: Bitcoin price goes on a wild ride   This is how it would work: EVR customers have to tell servers they want to pay in Bitcoins. Servers bring over a tablet with a BitPay app that lets merchants accept Bitcoins as a form of payment. The app converts the dollar value of the bill into Bitcoins and gives customers a bar code.   At its current value, a $15 martini at EVR will cost 0.08 Bitcoin. Customers would use their smart phones to scan the bar code that will deduct the amount from their Bitcoin accounts. BitPay will credit that $15 to the bar. The transaction happens instantaneously, EVR promises.   Currently, more than 100 retailers around the world are using the app to accept Bitcoins as payment, according to Tony Gallippy, co-founder and CEO of BitPay.   Shrem said Bitcoin transactions are cheaper than standard credit card ones; BitPay charges 1%, while credit cards can charge 3% to 5%.   It is also faster for him. BitPay transactions are processed on the same day, while credit card companies can take two weeks, since many customers dispute their bar tabs.  This is a modal window.   Shrem himself stands to gain if more people use the currency. He is also a founder of BitInstant, a payment processor for exchanges where Bitcoins are traded.   Along with his businesses, Shrem is the co-chairman of Bitcoin Foundation, a group that stands for promoting and standardizing the new currency. The foundation has about 250 members, according to its website. It charges 2.5 Bitcoins for an annual membership and 25 Bitcoins, or $4,750 at Monday's rate, for a lifetime one.   ""We're putting up stickers and banners to make sure they know this is the Bitcoin place,"" Shrem said. "
614,614,Major Bitcoin exchanges hit with cyberattacks,http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/04/technology/bitcoin-cyber-attacks/index.html,"Apr 4, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that claims to handle more than 70% of all Bitcoin trades, said in a statement on Thursday that it had been hit by a massive Distributed Denial of Service attack. In a DDoS attack, hackers direct a giant traffic surge to their target, overwhelming the site's servers and making it hard for legitimate users to gain access.   The attacks appear to have shaken confidence among some Bitcoin users.   On Wednesday, Bitcoins rose to $147, before pulling back overnight to around $115 as word of the cyberattacks spread. Mt. Gox said the attacks may be an effort to prompt ""panic selling"", with the hackers hoping to buy up cheap Bitcoins following the panic they've created -- and then waiting for the currency to rise again. They may also be aimed more generally at destabilizing the Bitcoin system.   ""[R]emember that Bitcoin, despite being designed to have its value increase over time, will always be the victim of people trying to abuse the system, or even the value of Bitcoin decreasing occasionally,"" the exchange said.   Related: Bitcoin ATMs coming soon   Mt. Gox said it was suffering its ""worst trading lag ever,"" with some users having difficulty logging into their accounts. The company said it was working to make sure the problem didn't become any more serious.   A Mt. Gox spokesman said in an email that individual accounts had not been compromised. The source of the attack, he added, is ""difficult to determine.""  This is a modal window.   Bitcoin is a four-year-old digital currency developed outside the authority of governments and central banks and designed to allow worldwide payments between users. The value of Bitcoins has surged in recent weeks amid decreasing trust in traditional banking systems, particularly after Cyprus imposed a tax on top bank depositors and placed limits on withdrawals to help pay for a European bailout.   Increased media attention has also helped fuel Bitcoin's rise. On Thursday afternoon, the value of one Bitcoin was hovering around $130, up from $47 two weeks ago and just 5 cents back in mid-2010.   Andreas Baumhof, chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm ThreatMetrix, noted that financial institutions of all kinds face attacks like the one that hit Mt. Gox. Because the market for Bitcoin is so much smaller than those for other currencies, he added, such disruptions are more likely to generate big swings in Bitcoin's value.   ""If I were to target a big financial institution, in no way would the value of the US dollar fluctuate,"" Baumhof said.   Related story: The Bitcoin trade is going higher, Higher, Higher!   Other Bitcoin utilities have also reported problems in recent days.   Bitcoin-Central, a site for the exchange and storage of the currency, and affiliated service Paytunia said they had detected a security breach on Monday and suspended operations pending an investigation. The services said Wednesday that they hoped to be up and running again by the end of the week, and that customers' account balances had not been affected.   Instawallet, an online service for Bitcoin storage, had a notice posted on its website Thursday saying it had been ""fraudulently accessed,"" and would be suspending service indefinitely. Users have been instructed to submit claims to recover their funds.   As the Bitcoin business matures, service providers for the digital currency will continue to beef up their cybersecurity in the same way large banks and online-payment firms like eBay's (EBAY) PayPal have in recent years, Baumhof said.   ""I'm fairly sure this will ultimately be just a blip,"" Baumhof said of the disruptions this week. "

616,616,Bitcoin ATMs coming soon,http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/04/investing/bitcoin-atms/index.html,"Apr 4, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Berwick expects to put the first two ATMs in Los Angeles and Cyprus in the next two weeks and is choosing between several different retail locations in both areas. He added that orders are coming in by the hundreds from 30 different countries.   Bitcoin, a virtual currency that was created four years ago, has generated tons of media attention in the past few weeks. The value of Bitcoins has surged in the wake of the botched bailout and mini-bank run in Cyprus and concerns about the health of government-backed paper currencies like the euro and dollar.   So how does a Bitcoin ATM work? Somewhat like a traditional ATM, says Berwick. Instead of connecting to your bank account, the software he and his team has developed is installed on an ATM and converts cash to Bitcoins stored in a Bitcoin wallet or extracts cash based on what's stored in your personal Bitcoin account.   Berwick will charge roughly $10,000 to ATM operators to maintain the machines and then split fees with those operators. He expects those fees to be around 3%. That's slightly higher than what you'd pay to get cash from an ATM outside your banking network.   So far, Berwick has used his personal savings to develop the software and build out the first prototype. He is currently hoping to raise between $1 million and $3 million in outside capital to get more ATMs in the hands of operators.   Related: Bitcoin prices go on a wild ride    Berwick says that getting a Bitcoin ATM up and running shouldn't be much more difficult than setting up any other ATM. In general, ATM operators must buy the machine, get cash into it and set up and maintain network connections to the Bitcoin wallets.   Last week, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued new guidelines outlining what anti-money laundering rules virtual currencies like Bitcoin must follow. Critics say that the currency's anonymity makes it particularly useful for money launderers. Members of Silk Road, an online drug bazaar, use it as their currency of choice.  This is a modal window.   While more cybercurrency rules may be coming, this isn't likely to hurt demand for Bitcoins and Bitcoin ATMs.   Virtual currencies are a quickly evolving marketplace. Right now, Bitcoin investors can trade in their coins for cash through a number of sites like Coinbase and BitInstant that work directly with banks to facilitate transfers. Some vendors are starting to accept the coins too, including the blog hosting site WordPress and the online community Reddit.   Related: The bitcoin trade: Higher, Higher, Higher!   Still, the potential pitfalls to maintaining a functioning Bitcoin ATM seem endless. On Wednesday, with Bitcoin prices soaring, Mt. Gox, one of the major trading exchanges, was offline at various times during the day. And while the overall network for creating Bitcoins is considered safe as it is monitored by a network of roughly 20,000 computers, some of the virtual ""wallets"" have been hit by hackers   Berwick, who runs the website Dollar Vigilante, has no doubt that Bitcoins will become even more ubiquitous. He hopes that Bitcoins can simply be used to buy and sell goods and services.   But it doesn't appear as if the latest Bitcoin craze is due to more people actually wanting to use the currency for purchasing things in the real world. Some Bitcoin buyers appear to be speculating in the currency, as its price has tripled to more than $140 in the past month. Just two and a half years ago, the price of a Bitcoin was 5 cents, according to Mt. Gox. This is clearly a risky market right now. Individual investors would be wise to avoid it.   That said, the economic turmoil in Cyprus was the main catalyst for the recent Bitcoin spike. And with no end in sight to Europe's sovereign debt crisis, more financial tremors in the eurozone seem likely.   ""If Cyprus happens in Ireland next or Spain or Italy, more people will start coming to Bitcoin,"" Berwick said. "

618,618,Gold prices fall as Cyprus fears ebb,http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/03/investing/gold-prices-cyprus/index.html,"Apr 3, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," Gold is trading around $1,575 an ounce, down 5% for the year. Adding to the downside, Credit Suisse cut its outlook for gold prices this year and next, saying demand in China won't be enough to offset a slowdown from other countries.   But some experts think the decline may only be temporary.   Just two months ago, the precious metal was closing in on $1,700 an ounce. With the Dow and S&P 500 at new record highs, and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index once again nearing extreme greed, it's not unusual to see a pullback in the precious metal. Investors tend to flock to gold as a safe haven when they get rattled.   Related: Track gold prices   ""There's always volatility in gold,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange. He still expects gold to move higher this year, pointing to increasing demand from emerging markets and geopolitical uncertainty. He said more bad news out of Europe or continued fears about North Korea's nuclear saber rattling could cause ""agita"" and drive prices higher.   Borthwick also noted the underlying concern about the Federal Reserve's bond buying program, or rather the timing of when that ends. His rationale? Investors in stocks have gotten too used to the Fed continuing to ease. So when the Fed finally does signal that its asset purchases are coming to an end, Borthwick said that may create more fear and uncertainty that ""could push gold higher rapidly.""   Also, there's lately been a shift away from paper money. Just take a look at what's been happening with virtual currency bitcoin. The four-year-old digital currency has been on a tear as speculators have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon.   ""Gold's short-term prospects are uncertain,"" said Jeffrey Nichols, managing director at American Precious Metals. ""We could very easily see a further retreat, possibly as low as $1,520""   Still, gold is also widely used as a hedge against inflation. One reason it has rallied in the past few years is because the Fed and other central banks have devalued their currencies through low interest rates. You could argue that the end of the Fed's quantitative easing could lead to higher bond rates and a stronger dollar. That would be bad for gold.   But any change in monetary policy could be outweighed by fears about fiscal policy in the U.S. The potential kerfuffle over the debt ceiling, which will again need to be raised, should hit the front burner in the next few months.   Related: What's next for markets   It's worth remembering that gold hit at a record high of $1,923 back in September 2011 -- shortly after Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its AAA rating.   The credit downgrade came after weeks of partisan bickering on the debt ceiling. Any repeat of that type of brinksmanship could be enough of a catalyst to push gold prices higher again. "

Cyprus became the first eurozone country since the currency was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, to place restrictions on how much money individuals and companies can take across its borders after confidence in its outsized financial system was shaken by the bailout terms.   Queues formed outside bank branches in the capital of Nicosia amid tight security but there was no evidence of panic. The stock exchange said it would remain shut until April 2 to give market participants time to adjust to the restrictions on financial transactions.   ""I think there's been remarkable tolerance by the people of Cyprus,"" said Carl Bildt, foreign minister of Sweden, which suffered its own banking crash in the 1990s.   ""I'm not particularly pessimistic about the long-term future for Cyprus - it's going to be difficult days now for some time but not for the long term,"" he told CNN.   Related: Calm, long lines as banks reopen   The banks had been shut since March 16 as it became clear that deposits would be raided as a condition of the 10 billion euro bailout.   The tiny island nation was brought to the brink of financial collapse and possible exit from the eurozone after its two biggest banks -- Bank of Cyprus and Popular Bank -- took big losses on Greek government debt, wiping out a third of their combined capital.   After months of negotiations, it signed up Monday for a bailout from its eurozone partners, backed by the International Monetary Fund, worth nearly 60% of gross domestic product.   In return, Cyprus committed to raise billions from big depositors to fund the winding down of Popular Bank and to recapitalize Bank of Cyprus. The EU wants Cyprus to shrink its banking industry to average size by 2018, which means shedding about half its assets.   Deposits above 100,000 euros have been frozen at both big banks. They could be wiped out entirely at Popular, while at Bank of Cyprus about 40% will be converted into equity.   Related: Tough times for Cyprus after EU bailout   All deposits of less than 100,000 euros are guaranteed. And the bailout does not affect smaller banks in Cyprus, which account for about 60% of the country's total deposits of 68 billion euros.   Many of those deposits belong to foreign investors, in particular Russians, and Cypriot authorities fear an uncontrolled flight of capital that would cause the economy to implode.   The use of controls breaks new ground for the EU, which is founded on the principle of free movement of capital and payments. Some economists argue that a partial break-up of the eurozone is underway as a euro held in Cyprus is no longer worth the same as a euro held in Germany.   Related: Bitcoin prices surge post-Cyprus bailout   Credit and debit card use abroad has been limited to 5,000 euros per month, and people leaving Cyprus can only take 3,000 euros in cash each trip.   Cyprus has banned the early withdrawal of funds on term deposits and transfers of more than 5,000 euros abroad, unless approved for trade purposes. Checks can be paid into accounts but not cashed, and a daily withdrawal limit of 300 euros has been set.   The European Commission said the controls were justified for an initial period of a week, but said they should be lifted as soon as possible.   ""The commission will continue monitoring the need to extend the validity of, or revise, the measures,"" the commission said in a statement.   The longer the strictures remain in place, the greater the potential loss of confidence in other small eurozone states with large banking industries.   And even if it manages to stabilize the banking system and relax controls, Cyprus faces years of hardship as the shrinking of one of its main service industries plunges the economy even deeper into recession.   ""A sharp contraction in Cypriot GDP of around 10% to 20% is likely in 2013-14 with only a weak recovery thereafter,"" noted forecasters at Oxford Economics. ""It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Cyprus will require additional bailouts in the future.""   Development of natural gas deposits discovered offshore may ease the pain, but they're unlikely to begin generating significant revenue for several years.   ""The EU deal was tough and what worries me is the next packet of measures they will try to impose,""said CNN iReporter George Georgiou. ""Is it going to be worse or better? Nobody knows.

""It is a jungle and we are the rabbit surrounded by lions."" It's a dramatic analogy, but one that accurately sums up Cypriots' disgust and helplessness at what they perceive to be the ultimate betrayal by the European Union. The last two weeks have been the most dramatic in decades for Greek Cyprus, still reeling from the harsh terms of a €10 billion bailout from international lenders to save the island nation's banking sector.  Large bank deposit holders are being forced to take huge losses, and unprecedented limits on the movement of cash have been imposed here. LATEST: Cyprus' banks reopen for first time in two weeks The prevailing mood is one of utter helplessness. Greek Cypriots are used to fighting. They fought Turkey for the very land they live on. But today there is no battle to fight against the nameless, faceless group of EU and International Monetary Fund bureaucrats and officials who have now become deeply involved in the future of their country.  ""We wanted to be Europe's friend,"" continues the driver, ""but now it is turning on us."" It's difficult not to sympathize. Groups of locals sit in pavement cafes in the capital city of Nicosia, anxiously watching state television, waiting for the next move, waiting for the next development in a seismic event which has rocked the Cyprus economy to its very core. Every interview, every comment is being dissected assiduously.  MORE: Bitcoin currency surges post-Cyprus bailout The biggest question this week was whether money would really be there when Cyprus' banks finally reopened Thursday. It is, but it can only be withdrawn €300 at a time. But Cypriots are also discussing and arguing about the long-term effects of the bailout.  What does austerity mean? How come the Irish and the Spanish didn't lose their savings? Why us? Walking down Nicosia's main shopping streets, there is little sign of an economic crisis. No queues at the ATMs. Restaurants are busy. Tourists are browsing through the many local stores. Heated discussions over Cypriot coffee can be heard everywhere, and although I can't understand the words, I can sense the frustration. These people are stuck in a state of limbo. Journalists bandy the term ""an uneasy calm"" around quite a lot, but it seems a perfect fit to describe the mood here. What's the point in getting angry if you don't know what you're getting angry about? What can you say to the government when their hands are being forced by Europe? What does it all mean for Cyprus?  Ironically, it is Cyprus' youth who seem to have foreseen the long term effect of the bailout. Hundreds of high school students have taken to the streets to voice their dismay over what they see as a threat to their future, though they weren't blaming the government for everything. Placards bearing unflattering comments about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel peppered their morning marches, orchestrated to pass under the gaze of the cameras of hundreds of journalists who set up camp in one of Nicosia's main squares and at the parliament building.  The feeling of worry was palpable. The Russians might lose their money, the young protesters seemed to be saying, but what about us? We could have just lost our future. I reached the end of the street and at the border crossing stumbled across a completely different, more Turkish side of Cyprus. I walked about 100 meters and spotted the bank.  The bank's doors were open, its Turkish flag blowing in the wind. Here people are pleased with the weather. Summer is coming. It's the high season for tourists and hopefully this year will be fruitful. Spare a thought for your Greek counterparts? A shop assistant shrugged.  What the long term effect of this bailout will be is anybody's guess. The rules change every day and while the government insists that the bailout -- and all that comes with it -- is the lesser of two evils, the people sitting in the cafes, those trying to run a business, and the shoe shiner trying to eek out a living remain unconvinced.  The last two weeks have shattered Cypriots' confidence in their country, and the people are fully aware that like a rabbit in the jungle, Cyprus has been well and truly cornered. "

That compares with just 5 cents per bitcoin in mid-July 2010, when Mt. Gox first started tracking prices.   Related: 'Funny money' has officially entered the real world   Trading volume has also exploded. Between 60,000 and 110,000 bitcoins have changed hands per day recently, according to Mt. Gox. That's double to triple the amount traded a few weeks ago.   Albert Hendriks, a 32-year-old programmer for a high-speed trading firm in Amsterdam, jumped into the currency for the first time this week, purchasing €1000 worth of bitcoins. He's not worried about the safety of the global banking system, but he sees bitcoins as a lucrative investment.   ""I think the currency is maturing,"" Hendriks said. ""It's risky, but I think more and more people are starting to trust it.""   Bitcoin investors can trade in their coins for cash through a number of sites like Coinbase and BitInstant that work directly with banks to facilitate transfers. Some vendors are starting to accept the coins too, including the blog hosting site Wordpress and the online community Reddit.   Jeff Berwick, a media entrepreneur who runs the website Dollar Vigilante, hopes to open one of the world's first bitcoin ATMs in Cyprus in the next few weeks. The ATM there would allow individuals to retrieve cash for their digital bitcoins or put cash into the machine to add to their bitcoin collection.   ""It's going to be an experiment,"" said Berwick, who also aims to install a machine in Los Angeles in the next few weeks.   Related: Why cyber currency Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high   Bitcoin has been one giant global experiment since an anonymous developer using the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" created it in 2009 as a currency that's free from government intervention and has no central bank backing. Bitcoin transactions typically carry very low exchange or processing fees.   As of now, nearly 11 million bitcoins are in circulation, making the current value of all outstanding bitcoins roughly $975 million.   These coins are ""minted"" by a network of computers running specialized software on powerful (and often pricey) hardware systems. The software is designed to release new coins at a steady -- and finite -- pace that slows down over time. Bitcoin's algorithm caps the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created at 21 million. More than 99% of them will be circulating by 2033, but the very last bitcoin won't be generated until around 2140.   ""The point of the bitcoin is that you don't have to trust the founder,"" said Jeff Garzik, a computer programmer in Raleigh, N.C., who has served as a consultant to businesses working with bitcoins. ""People are drawn to it because it can't be artificially manipulated by any human. Central bankers can't just decide to make more of it.""   Last week, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued new guidelines outlining what anti-money laundering rules virtual currencies like bitcoin must follow. Critics say that the currency's anonymity makes it particularly useful for money launderers. Members of Silk Road, an online drug bazaar, use it as their currency of choice.   Although bitcoin businesses now have more regulatory hoops to jump through, Garzik said he sees the new rules as a tacit acceptance by the U.S. government of the currency's legitimacy.   Meanwhile, Hendriks hopes that he won't ever have to exchange his newly purchased bitcoins for dollars or euros.   ""I hope it will become a global currency, and I can use it without turning it back into another currency,"" Hendriks said.   -CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report.  "
623,623,Why cyber currency Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high,http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/06/technology/innovation/bitcoin/index.html,"Mar 6, 2013","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," One bitcoin is was worth about $40 U.S. dollars on Tuesday, and surged on Wednesday to nearly $49. That's up from around $13 in January, and 5 cents in 2010, according to Mt. Gox, the bitcoin market's main exchange. On that and other trading sites, buyers can swap their digital coins for cold, hard cash.   Watchers of the alternative currency attribute some of bitcoin's rise to the recent decision by several popular-in-geek-circles vendors to accept the coins -- most notably, blog hosting site Wordpress and the online community Reddit.   ""These guys are killing it on retail,"" Peter Vessenes, chairman of the trade group Bitcoin Foundation, said of bitcoin's growing acceptance with merchants.   The coins are also much easier to obtain than they used to be. Until recently, a buyer typically needed to navigate an international wire transfer and wait days for the transaction to clear. Sites like like Coinbase and Bitinstant let customers buy bitcoins with U.S. cash or bank transfers. Vessenes' own bitcoin exchange, CoinLab, is set to launch later this month.   Some longtime advocates are leery of the recent run-up.   ""Most people don't think $40 is a valid price right now,"" said Jon Holmquist, head of marketing at two Bitcoin-related startups, Coinabul and Bitcoinstore.   Stefan Thomas, founder of community site We Use Coins, thinks the rise is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.   ""When the price starts going up, you get a lot of speculators that want to ride the wave,"" he said.   Because the number of transactions and overall value of coins in circulation is relatively low, the currency is quite volatile -- it went from under $1 to over $28, then back to $7 in 2011 alone.   Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous developer using the pseudonym ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" -- the Japanese equivalent of a bland name like ""John Smith."" It has no central-bank backing. The idea was to create a currency that's free from government intervention and can be used to conduct transactions without hefty exchange or processing fees.   One deal chronicled on the bitcoin data site BlockChain involved a transfer worth nearly $80,000. The processing fee was 1.8 cents. Beat that, Western Union.   Coins are ""minted"" by a network of computers running specialized software on powerful (and often pricey) hardware systems. The software is designed to release new coins at a steady -- and finite -- pace. Right now, one new ""block"" of 25 bitcoins is generated roughly every 10 minutes, adding to the pool of around 10.8 million circulating coins.   The underlying system that generates coins is extremely difficult to attack, but the ""digital wallets"" bitcoin owners use to store their wealth haven't been so lucky. A series of high-profile thefts in 2011 crashed the currency's value, and one exchange operator lost 24,000 bitcoins to a thief in September. Critics also contend that the anonymous nature of the currency could make it the monetary instrument of choice for money launderers. It's already the standard currency for Silk Road, a notorious online drug bazaar.   Still, bitcoin backers think its recent rise is a sign of its growing community and more widespread acceptance. They see it as a valid alternative to traditional cash.   ""The U.S. dollar is an obvious Ponzi scheme,"" said Thomas, who thinks the U.S. government has too much debt to raise interest rates high enough to defend the dollar if there were ever a run on it. With Bitcoin, ""you feel like you're in control of your money."" "
624,624,Group claiming to have Romney tax records threatens to leak them,http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/06/politics/romney-tax-threat/index.html,"Sep 6, 2012","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters,"An anonymous group says it stole copies of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's tax records and will release them unless the company it stole them from pays $1 million. The Secret Service said it is investigating, and the company said there is no immediate sign that any such theft took place. ""Using your office"" in Franklin, Tennessee, the group tells PricewaterhouseCoopers in an online posting, ""we were able to gain access to your network file servers and copy over the tax documents for one Willard M Romney and Ann D Romney."" It threatens to send encrypted copies to ""all major news outlets"" and warns, ""If the parties interested do not want the encrypted key released to the public to unlock these documents on September 28 of this year then payment will be necessary."" If the money is not received, ""the entire world will be allowed to view the documents with a publicly released key to unlock everything,"" the group warns. The group demands $1 million worth of the online currency Bitcoins. It also says that people who want the documents released can send money as well, and whichever side sends $1 million first will win. Bitcoin is a digital currency not overseen by any government or bank. Various merchants accept the currency for goods and services. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers tax services as well as auditing and more, tweeted that it is ""working with the Secret Service. At this time, there is no evidence of unauthorized access to our data."" The anonymous postings say that flash drive copies of the stolen material have been sent to the company, as well as to the county Democratic and Republican offices, and that a scanned image of Romney's signature from the forms was included. Jean Barwick with the Williamson County, Tennessee, Republican Party told CNN that her office found the package -- a padded envelope -- on Friday outside the door to the party offices. The package ""didn't seem credible,"" partly because it said ""for learders"" instead of ""leaders,"" she said. Inside were a letter -- one that has been posted online -- and a flash drive. ""I didn't put that in any of our computers,"" and no one has looked at the contents, she said. ""I put it in the drawer."" She called state party officials, who were in Tampa, Florida, at the Republican National Convention at the time, she said. Her office later reported the package to local police, and the Secret Service picked it up Wednesday, she said. County Democratic Party Chairman Peter Burr also told CNN the package arrived last week, and the Secret Service came Wednesday to collect it. ""We did not view it,"" Burr said. He added that he considered looking at it, and the party attorney ""advised us not to."" ""We wouldn't have been interested to use it even if it was"" real, he said. The package was dropped through the mail slot to the party office, Burr said. It had been hand-addressed with a blue highlighter. The state party advised the office to turn it over to the Secret Service, Burr said. He said he thinks it was a scam. In an online posting, the group said the alleged theft took place on August 25. The Franklin Police Department did not respond to any calls at the building containing the PricewaterhouseCoopers office in August and did not take a report from any tenants of the building during the month either, a police spokesman said Thursday. On Wednesday, it responded to the Republican Party office, and ""due to the nature of the call, we contacted the Secret Service who met with our officers at the scene and assumed responsibility for the investigation,"" Lt. Charles Warner said. Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg directed questions to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chris Atkins, a spokesman for the firm, said the company does not share information on how long it has done taxes for any client. Atkins added that he has no idea why the Franklin office would be named in the claims. The company has more than 80 offices around the country and there's nothing unique about the one in Franklin, he said. While the postings, on the website pastebin.com, refer to ""a team"" involved in the alleged break-in, one ends with a line stating that certain ""considerations did not deter me from the path of duty"" and a reference to ""the will of my Heavenly Father."" The postings go into detail about how the alleged theft was carried out. The group says it obtained ""all available 1040 tax forms for Romney,"" including some from before 2010, but it does not say which years. Romney has released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns, and has said he will not release others. The issue has been a source of controversy on the campaign trail. Pastebin allows users to paste text anonymously for a period of time. The company explains on its website that it was created to help programmers, and anything not related to that ""which results in unusually high traffic will be flagged for investigation. Your paste may be deleted and your IP blocked. In particular, please do not paste email lists, password lists or personal information."" The company did not immediately respond to an e-mail from CNN asking whether it plans to remove the posts. The site logs files of users' Internet protocol addresses and service providers, along with some other information, the website explains. But the data is ""not linked to any information that is personally identifiable."" Many hackers take numerous steps to protect anonymity, making it difficult to track them down. Jeff Garzik, listed on the Bitcoin website as part of its development team, told CNN the ""consensus among the Bitcoin chattering class appears to be that this is a hoax."" He cited an online forum in which many users express that view. The currency is traceable, even if users go by pseudonyms, Garzik said. Every transaction is stored in a ""block chain,"" which he compares to ""a public ledger."" ""It seems unlikely that thieves would make so public a heist, with law enforcement so likely to watch the block chain and associated Bitcoin exchanges,"" he said."
625,625,Get ready for a Bitcoin debit card,http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/22/technology/startups/bitcoin-debit-card/index.html,"Aug 22, 2012","['bitcoin', '', '']",reuters," ""People are always asking, 'Well, what can I spend Bitcoins on?'"" says Erik Voorhees, BitInstant's head of communications. ""You can finally just say, 'Everything.'""   The Bitcoin economy sounds like something out of science fiction. Launched in 2009, it's a first-of-its-kind ""cryptocurrency"" consisting of mathematical tokens. Bitcoins aren't issued by any government or bank. The community-backed system is facilitated by complex cryptography and a peer-to-peer transaction network.   New coins are created by ""mining,"" a hardware-intensive task that requires using powerful computer systems to solve complex algorithms. There's a finite supply: The system is designed to create a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins, a target that won't be hit for a decade or more. Right now there are roughly 9.8 million Bitcoins in circulation, worth a combined total of around $96 million.   Bitcoins are still far from mainstream, but they can be used as a valid form of payment for all kinds of goods and services -- shopping site Bitmit offers a look at some of what's available. The coins are a bit like the local currencies used in small towns like Ithaca, N.Y.: They have value because a community has collectively decided to back the notes as tender.   What is a Bitcoin worth? Like any currency, it fluctuates.   A spate of media attention in 2011 -- most notably a Gawker article that linked Bitcoin to Silk Road, an underground drug bazaar -- sent the price of a Bitcoin to a stratospheric high of more than $31. But e-currency thefts followed, and by November 2011 the price of a Bitcoin plummeted to $2.   None of that fazes BitInstant, an 11-month-old New York startup that wants to build bridges between the Bitcoin economy and the regular consumer world.   ""We want to be the Apple of Bitcoin,"" says Charlie Shrem, the CEO of BitInstant. ""We want everything to be sleek, sexy, beautiful, fluid, automated.""   In two weeks, it will launch Bitcoin Wireless -- a way to buy wireless time for your mobile device from over 300 carriers, they say, including major U.S. providers such as Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T).   BitInstant's core business is facilitating Bitcoin transactions across a variety of exchanges. Want to swap $100 in cash for Bitcoins? You can deposit the cash at one of 700,000 locations worldwide and receive the Bitcoins in your virtual wallet instantly.   BitInstant now handles a transaction volume of $2.5 million a month, Shrem says, and is close to closing a $1 million round of venture capital financing -- the largest ever for a Bitcoin-related company.   The forthcoming Paycard is the company's biggest bid yet for mainstream adoption. BitInstant is partnering with two major banks, one domestic and one international. The company isn't releasing their names yet, but Shrem says the arrangement will let the Paycard connect with MasterCard's (MA) network.   That means Paycard can be used at traditional retailers. Shrem calls the card ""our entrée into the real world."" It will be a gradual introduction: BitInstant plans to limit its initial release to 5,000 cards.  This is a modal window.   Gavin Andresen, a lead developer in the Bitcoin community, says he's looking forward to using the Paycard, especially for international travel.   ""I was invited to Europe a few months ago, and the company hosting me reimbursed my airfare expenses using Bitcoin, which was much more convenient than dealing with international wire transfers,"" he told CNNMoney in an email. ""It would have been even more convenient (and just as simple) if I had them reimburse to an international BitInstant debit card that I could use for daily expenses when traveling.""   Each Paycard will have a unique Bitcoin address and a QR code that, when scanned by a mobile app, will allow the instant digital transfer of Bitcoins to the card, where they get converted into the owner's national currency. Shrem says one of the card's chief benefits will be its low conversion rate between foreign currencies -- ""lower than what Travelex and Western Union, all of these airport places, would charge you.""   Bitcoin's backers admit that there is some inherent risk to the electronic currency. After all, there is no FDIC for Bitcoin. It's also volatile: In the last 30 days, the value of a Bitcoin in U.S. dollars has ranged between $7.58 and $15.40.   While Bitcoin is no longer in its infancy, it may have entered its ""terrible twos."" Exchanges have been plagued by hacks, trading glitches and Madoff-esque pyramid schemes. The currency's image as a tool of hackers and anti-government types has both helped and hurt its public profile. (It's worth noting, however, that while Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked, Bitcoin's encryption code never has been.)   Andresen recently cautioned restraint when trying out the experimental currency: ""Only invest time or money in it that you can afford to lose.""   Still, he's eager to test out Bitcoin's new real-world link.   ""My kids are about to become teenagers, and I think I'll give them BitInstant cards in their stockings this Christmas,"" he says. ""They should be a fantastic, low-cost way to give them a little bit of money to spend while retaining the ability to monitor their spending as it happens.""   Why would anyone want to change their hard-earned money into Bitcoins? One advantage Bitcoin fans cite is the ability to move money instantly anywhere in the world. By eliminating the middlemen -- credit-card companies, financial institutions, PayPal -- Bitcoin allows money to change hands digitally as quickly as cash does in the real world.   With Bitcoins ""you have total control of your money,"" Voorhees says. ""It's quite empowering."" "
